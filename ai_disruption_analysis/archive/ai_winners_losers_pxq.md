# AI Winners & Losers: P×Q Framework

Sectors: Software, Internet, Fintech

## Core Thesis

**The P×Q Heuristic for AI Impact on Software Business Models**

AI's impact on software companies depends critically on their revenue model:

1. **Part 1:** Does revenue come from P × Q (price per API hit × number of API hits)?
2. **Part 2:** Is Q bottlenecked on human labor?


| Revenue Model | Q Bottleneck        | AI Impact                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Seat-based    | N/A                 | **LOSER** - Fewer humans = fewer seats         |
| P×Q          | Yes, humans limit Q | **WINNER** - AI removes bottleneck, Q explodes |
| P×Q          | No                  | Neutral                                        |

## Framework Logic

### Why Seat-Based Models Lose

Revenue = (Price per Seat) × (Number of Seats)

If AI agents replace human workers:

- Fewer employees = fewer seats needed
- CRM seats shrink as sales teams shrink
- HCM revenue falls as headcount falls
- Collaboration tools lose users

**The transition problem:** Companies can't charge both seat-based AND usage-based. Customers won't pay double. Pivoting pricing models is extremely difficult.

### Why P×Q with Human-Bottlenecked Q Wins

Revenue = (Price per Query/Call/Event) × (Number of Queries/Calls/Events)

For these to be AI winners:

1. Revenue must be usage/consumption-based (not seats)
2. Q (usage) must currently be LIMITED by humans
3. AI removes the bottleneck → Q explodes → Revenue explodes

**Canonical Example: Snowflake**

Today: Q is bottlenecked by ~50K data analysts who can write SQL
Tomorrow: AI copilots let 5M business users query directly

**Q increases 100x** while Snowflake's P (price per compute credit) stays constant.

> "SNOW could theoretically benefit if more queries are run since more non-technical people are using SNOW."
