## Sector: Software (13 Companies)

### CTSH: Cognizant
**Classification:** Bucket 3: AI Loser | **Action:** SHORT | **Conviction:** High

**Business:** Global IT services provider (~$20B revenue) specializing in consulting, technology services, and outsourcing.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Clear disruption via the P×Q framework. IT services revenue = billable hours × rate. AI increases efficiency → fewer billable hours needed per project → structural revenue pressure. This is the thesis's "Category 5: IT Services" archetype.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Citi (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "GenAI/agentic displacement fears for the group" |
| Citi | 2026-01 | "Terminal value concerns" driving multiple compression |
| Thesis (p. 12) | - | "Billable hours model breaks when AI increases efficiency" |

**Decision Path:** Billable hours model is the highest-risk software pricing model per thesis. Management claims AI investments have operating leverage, but ignores market pricing impact. GCC acceleration (enterprises in-sourcing) compounds the problem.

---

### EPAM: EPAM Systems
**Classification:** Bucket 3: AI Loser | **Action:** SHORT | **Conviction:** High

**Business:** Digital platform engineering and software development services ($5B+ revenue), heavily Eastern European workforce.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Same IT services dynamic as CTSH but potentially worse given developer focus. "Vibe coding" tools directly substitute for their core service. Developer headcount growth has moved from MSD-HSD to flat or declining per thesis.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Citi | 2026-01 | "AI-powered delivery: Enterprises are reluctant to pay a premium for billable hours" |
| Truist (p. 3) | 2026-01 | "Vibe coding tools" cited as key risk factor |
| Thesis (p. 12) | - | "Every firm affirming need to transform from time-and-materials to fixed-price/outcome-based" |

**Decision Path:** Developer-focused IT services is even more exposed than general IT services. Coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) directly substitute for their core offering.

---

### PLTR: Palantir
**Classification:** Bucket 1: AI Winner | **Action:** LONG | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** AI platform enabling enterprises and governments to connect data with GenAI for automation and decision-making.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Clear AI beneficiary—revenue accelerated from 17% (2023) to 54% (2025E) driven by AIP (AI Platform). However, trades at extreme valuation (155x EV/Sales) which the thesis warns about for "fake AI winners."

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Truist (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "Leading Software Platform at the Forefront of AI Implementation" |
| Truist (p. 13) | 2026-01 | "Palantir has been a clear beneficiary of AI tailwinds... uniquely positioned for the moment" |
| Truist (p. 9) | 2026-01 | "AIP allows customers to leverage LLMs and GenAI with their data in a secure environment" |

**Decision Path:** Unlike fake AI winners, PLTR has demonstrated clear AI revenue acceleration (not just narrative). Commercial revenue growth accelerated to 73% y/y. Valuation is the key risk—need to believe sustained 50%+ growth to justify multiple.

**Counter-Evidence & Risks:**
- Valuation: 155x EV/Sales, 103x EV/FCF on 2027E
- Thesis warns: "High-multiple stocks are re-rating based on terminal value concerns"
- Customer concentration in government could slow

---

### DOCU: DocuSign
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** Electronic signature and agreement management platform (~$3B revenue).

**AI Impact Assessment:** Agentic disruption concern is real (OpenAI's DocuGPT demo) but impact timeline unclear. Company pivoting to "Intelligent Agreement Management" (IAM) to address broader workflow TAM.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| BofA (p. 1) | 2025-12 | "Debate on agentic disruption is ongoing. Since the demo of an agreement management agent, DocuGPT by OpenAI in September, the stock has been weighed down by agentic disruption concerns" |
| BofA | 2025-12 | "Encouraged by progress with IAM, which is key to fending off that threat" |
| UBS | 2025-12 | "IAM cycle" cited as key debate |

**Decision Path:** Market is pricing agentic risk but thesis outcome is unclear. IAM could expand TAM or AI could disintermediate signature workflows entirely. Classic Bucket 2: "can't tell if AI helps or hurts them."

---

### MNDY: monday.com
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** Work management software platform (~$1.2B revenue) with seat-based pricing.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Seat-based pricing = structural loser per P×Q framework. However, market has already heavily penalized the stock (-35% YTD), and sell-side argues worst-case is priced in.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Guggenheim (p. 1) | 2025-12 | "In our view, valuation already reflects a worst-case scenario of AI-driven productivity inducing seat count decline. This is far from reality." |
| Guggenheim (p. 5) | 2025-12 | "AI Risk to Seat Growth: If AI lives up to its promise and increases workforce productivity... there will be fewer humans needed" |
| Guggenheim (p. 5) | 2025-12 | "Other AI Risks: Performance Marketing and Vibe Coding" |

**Decision Path:** Thesis says seat-based = loser, but valuation already reflects this. Stock pricing zero growth + declining FCF in terminal year. At 2.0x growth-adjusted EV/Sales (vs 3.6x peer avg), bad news may be priced. Pivot to usage-based pricing in progress.

---

### MDB: MongoDB
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** Document database platform (~$2B revenue) with consumption-based pricing.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Consumption-based pricing should be AI beneficiary per thesis (AI removes human bottleneck on Q → usage explodes). However, "AI progress still not visible" in financial results.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Macquarie (headline) | 2025-12 | "Another strong beat and raise, but AI progress still not visible" |
| Macquarie (p. 1) | 2025-12 | "We think MDB's long-term future likely depends on an AI-driven transformation of its market position, not yet visible" |
| Raymond James (p. 6) | 2025-12 | "Uniquely aligned with how modern applications and AI systems are being built" |

**Decision Path:** Right pricing model for AI world but execution not yet proving it. Potential Bucket 1 if AI traction materializes. Watch for RAG use case adoption as leading indicator.

---

### ZM: Zoom
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** Video communications platform (~$4.8B revenue) with seat-based pricing.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Seat-based = structural loser, but company pivoting to AI Companion monetization. AI features (Zoom Virtual Agent, AI Expert Assist) showing early traction in CX deals.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| BTIG (p. 1) | 2025-12 | "AI Monetization: Besides indirectly monetizing AI through AI Companion 3.0... many of ZM's directly monetized AI capabilities are expected to drive even more growth" |
| BTIG (p. 1) | 2025-12 | "Nine of last quarter's top ten CX deals involved paid AI, such as Zoom Virtual Agent or AI Expert Assist" |
| BTIG (p. 2) | 2025-12 | "Zoom Workplace with AI Companion is an open, AI-first work platform" |

**Decision Path:** Attempting transition from seat-based video to AI-enhanced collaboration platform. Transition success unclear. Strong FCF generation (39% margins) but growth near-zero.

---

### CHKP: Check Point
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** Enterprise cybersecurity solutions ($2.5B+ revenue).

**AI Impact Assessment:** Cybersecurity is net AI beneficiary (more sophisticated threats require better defenses), but Check Point not clearly differentiated as the AI security winner vs. peers.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| MS Conference | 2025-12 | AI opportunity in SecOps discussed |
| Oppenheimer | 2025-12 | Scenario analysis focused on M&A, not AI disruption |

**Decision Path:** No clear AI disruption mechanism (not a loser), but also no clear AI winner thesis. Cybersecurity benefits broadly from AI, making differentiation hard to call.

---

### FTNT: Fortinet
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** Network security solutions including firewalls, secure SD-WAN (~$6B revenue).

**AI Impact Assessment:** Similar to CHKP—cybersecurity benefits from AI threat landscape but FTNT not clearly the winner. SecOps AI is opportunity but competitive landscape is crowded.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Truist (3Q25 recap) | 2025-12 | AI opportunity in SecOps mentioned |

**Decision Path:** No clear AI disruption mechanism. Hardware-centric model could be disadvantaged vs. cloud-native security players.

---

### SAP_GY: SAP
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** Enterprise software giant (~€34B revenue), dominant in ERP.

**AI Impact Assessment:** "AI remains a double-edged sword." Joule AI copilot could drive upsell, but could also reduce seat count as users become more productive.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Deutsche Bank (headline) | 2026-01 | "Improving growth into '26 but AI remains a double-edged sword" |
| Oppenheimer | 2026-01 | "Positive Business Trends" but no AI-specific thesis |

**Decision Path:** Cloud ERP migration creates switching costs and stickiness. AI is both opportunity (Joule) and threat (seat reduction). Classic Bucket 2 ambiguity.

---

### PTC: PTC Inc
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Low

**Business:** Industrial software (CAD, PLM, IoT) serving manufacturing (~$2.5B revenue).

**AI Impact Assessment:** No clear AI disruption mechanism in CAD/PLM. Engineering design tools could incorporate AI (generative design) but this is enhancement, not disruption.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Oppenheimer | 2025-11 | Focus on IoT divestiture, not AI |
| KeyBanc | 2025-11 | Operational focus, minimal AI discussion |

**Decision Path:** Industrial software with specialized workflows. AI likely helpful (generative design) but no existential threat. Low conviction either direction.

---

### ROP: Roper Technologies
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Low

**Business:** Diversified technology holding company (77% software) with niche vertical applications.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Niche vertical software is defensible—sticky customers, high switching costs, mission-critical workflows. No clear AI disruption mechanism across the portfolio.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Piper Sandler | 2025-11 | "Software Niches Still Poised to Deliver Long-Term Compounding" |
| Citi | 2026-01 | "Near-term Issues" focus, not AI disruption |

**Decision Path:** Portfolio approach diversifies AI risk. Individual holdings vary but overall no clear AI thesis either direction.

---

### VRSN: VeriSign
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Low

**Business:** Registry services for .com and .net domains (~$1.5B revenue).

**AI Impact Assessment:** Indirect risk: if AI agents reduce need for websites/web presence, domain demand could decline. However, this is speculative and long-dated.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Citi | 2026-02 | ".Com Growth Accelerates" - no AI disruption discussion |
| Citi | 2025-12 | Domain tracker focused on registration trends, not AI |

**Decision Path:** No direct AI disruption discussed in sell-side coverage. Infrastructure-level business with regulated pricing. Risk is indirect (fewer websites needed) but timeline very unclear.

---

## Sector: Internet/Media (10 Companies)

### TTD: The Trade Desk
**Classification:** Bucket 3: AI Loser | **Action:** SHORT | **Conviction:** High

**Business:** Demand-side platform (DSP) for programmatic advertising, enabling advertisers to buy digital ad inventory.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Clear AI disruption with multiple mechanisms: (1) GenAI lowering switching costs across DSPs by simplifying buying interfaces, (2) AI search reducing open web display advertising traffic, (3) Amazon's AI-powered DSP (Brand+, Performance+, Ads Agent) gaining share with superior first-party data.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| JMP (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "We believe generative AI is lowering switching costs across DSPs by simplifying the programmatic buying user interface, which we expect will further intensify competition" |
| JMP (p. 3) | 2026-01 | "AI search and AI Overviews are having a material impact on open web display advertising, a trend we expect to worsen in 2026" |
| JMP (p. 7) | 2026-01 | "As AI functionality becomes embedded within DSP interfaces, we believe the sophistication required to operate a DSP is declining, lowering switching costs" |

**Decision Path:** Multiple AI disruption mechanisms with clear timelines. JMP downgraded specifically citing AI competition. The thesis's "Discovery & Social Platforms" category applies—discovery moving to LLMs hurts open web advertising.

---

### SHOP: Shopify
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** E-commerce platform enabling merchants to build online stores and manage sales (~$11B revenue).

**AI Impact Assessment:** Thesis flags "e-commerce infrastructure" risk (agents bypass websites, API-only needed). However, SHOP is actively positioning for agentic commerce via Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) with Google.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Truist (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "We believe Shopify is positioned to become the operating system for agentic commerce following the launch of the Universal Commerce Protocol" |
| Truist (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "UCP is the introduction of a bridge from conversational AI to real-time commerce as agents transition from answering questions to completing transactions" |
| Thesis (p. 10) | - | "Anthropic or other AI companies could create 'e-commerce ghost kitchens'—just API endpoints for agent purchases" |

**Decision Path:** Thesis sees SHOP at risk but company is proactively addressing agentic commerce. UCP could be defense mechanism or could commoditize SHOP's value. Outcome genuinely unclear. Classic "can't tell if AI helps or hurts."

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Truist remains Hold (not bearish), sees SHOP as potential share gainer
- Trading at 40x non-GAAP may already price risk

---

### PINS: Pinterest
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** Visual discovery and social media platform (~$4.2B ad revenue).

**AI Impact Assessment:** Thesis calls PINS "viewed as zero" as discovery moves to LLMs. However, sell-side sees stable share of digital ad spend and Performance+ AI tools driving growth.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| TD Cowen (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "We forecast PINS share of WW Digital adv. remains stable from '25-'31" |
| TD Cowen (p. 2) | 2026-01 | "56% of surveyed ad buyers have already used Performance+, up from 42% who said the same in last year's survey" |
| Thesis (p. 8) | - | "Viewed as 'zero' as discovery moves to LLMs... Was dead before AI—AI just accelerates decline" |

**Decision Path:** Thesis is very bearish (zero) but sell-side maintains Buy. Market share stable at 0.7% of digital ad spend. Disagreement is unresolved—avoiding is appropriate.

**Gaps:**
- Watch for user engagement trends vs. LLM-based discovery adoption

---

### DUOL: Duolingo
**Classification:** Bucket 1: AI Winner | **Action:** LONG | **Conviction:** High

**Business:** Language learning and education app (~$1B revenue) with gamified, subscription-based model.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Clear AI beneficiary—AI enhances product development, content generation, and real-time features. ~100% of new code is AI-generated. Competitive advantage comes from engagement/gamification, not content that AI could replicate.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Truist (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "Nearly 100% of new code at Duolingo is AI-generated today... technology has helped create efficiencies and makes it easier to iterate" |
| Truist (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "Prototype for its new Chess course was created by non-technical employees using vibe coding (Cursor)" |
| Truist (p. 2) | 2026-01 | "While he believes people can learn languages... straight from ChatGPT, Duolingo retains its competitive advantages as those channels require significantly more dedication" |

**Decision Path:** AI is being used internally to accelerate product development (vibe coding prototype, AI content generation). The moat is engagement and habit formation, not content—AI alternatives require more user dedication. Per thesis P×Q framework: subscription revenue with AI-enhanced Q (more content, features) = winner.

---

### ROKU: Roku
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Low

**Business:** CTV streaming platform and advertising business (~$4.7B revenue).

**AI Impact Assessment:** Thesis mentions ROKU in "Discovery & Social Platforms" risk category, but sell-side is bullish on CTV advertising growth and diversification strategy.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| BofA (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "Several irons in the fire... potential path to $1bn in adj. EBITDA in CY27" |
| BofA (p. 3) | 2026-01 | "Convergence of two dynamics: 1) rise of AI-powered video creation tools and 2) emergence of user-friendly self-serve advertising platforms as the key catalyst" |
| Thesis (p. 9) | - | "Platforms become less valuable as agents handle purchasing through ChatGPT/Gemini" |

**Decision Path:** Thesis sees CTV platform risk from agents, but sell-side sees AI as opportunity (self-serve ads, AI creative tools). No clear AI disruption mechanism specific to ROKU discussed in recent reports.

---

### OMC: Omnicom
**Classification:** Bucket 3: AI Loser | **Action:** SHORT | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** Global advertising and marketing services holding company (~$16B revenue).

**AI Impact Assessment:** Creative agencies face AI remuneration model risk. AI catalyzes shift from billable/time-based to outcome-based models. Similar to IT services but applied to creative work.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| BofA (p. 2) | 2026-01 | "Creative agencies face accelerated revenue attrition risks in 2026 as AI likely catalyses a change in remuneration models. Omnicom has 25%+ of revenue tied to this practice" |
| BofA (p. 1) | 2026-01 | "We downgrade to Underperform... cutting our 2026-28E EPS 7-12%, well below consensus" |

**Decision Path:** Similar dynamic to IT services (CTSH, EPAM)—billable hours/time-based pricing faces compression as AI increases efficiency. Creative agencies specifically called out.

---

### PUB_FP: Publicis
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Medium

**Business:** French advertising/media holding company (~€13B revenue) with Epsilon data business.

**AI Impact Assessment:** MS says "AI concerns overdone" due to Epsilon's data moat and ability to shift to alternative channels (CTV). Zero-click search risk to open web display is real but Epsilon data collection not significantly impacted.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Morgan Stanley (p. 1) | 2025-12 | "AI concerns overdone, valuation attractive... We think share price upside will be driven by upward consensus revisions" |
| Morgan Stanley (p. 3) | 2025-12 | "Could it affect Epsilon's ability to collect data? = Low risk" |
| Morgan Stanley (p. 3) | 2025-12 | "Could Publicis' open web display ad activation business decline? = Moderate risk & opportunity" |

**Decision Path:** Better positioned than OMC due to Epsilon data assets. AI search risk acknowledged but alternative channels (CTV) provide offset. Narrative risk but not clear loser.

---

### EL_FP: EssilorLuxottica
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Low

**Business:** Eyewear and lens manufacturer, owner of Ray-Ban brand. Partnered with Meta on Ray-Ban smart glasses.

**AI Impact Assessment:** No clear AI disruption mechanism. Meta Ray-Ban partnership positions company in AI hardware/wearables trend but unclear if this is transformative for core eyewear business.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Jefferies | 2026-01 | Meta Ray-Ban partnership discussed |
| Stifel | 2026-01 | 2026 outlook focused on operations, not AI |

**Decision Path:** Hardware/luxury goods business without clear AI disruption thesis. Smart glasses partnership is interesting but not core to valuation.

---

### EBAY: eBay
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Low

**Business:** E-commerce marketplace for consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales.

**AI Impact Assessment:** Marketplace model could face discovery shift to LLMs, but eBay has unique inventory (used goods, collectibles) that may be defensible.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| Bernstein | 2026-01 | US eCommerce sector analysis |
| Stifel | 2026-01 | 4Q25 preview, operational focus |

**Decision Path:** No specific AI disruption thesis in reports. Marketplace discovery could shift to agents but unique inventory (C2C, used goods) provides differentiation. Low conviction either direction.

---

### TTWO: Take-Two Interactive
**Classification:** Bucket 2: Narrative Risk | **Action:** AVOID | **Conviction:** Low

**Business:** Video game publisher (Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K, Red Dead Redemption).

**AI Impact Assessment:** Gaming content creation could benefit from AI (faster development, more content). No clear AI disruption mechanism. GTA VI cycle is primary driver.

**Supporting Evidence:**
| Source | Date | Quote |
|--------|------|-------|
| BofA | 2026-02 | 3FQ26 earnings focus, no AI thesis |
| TD Cowen | 2025-11 | "Best Ideas 2026" based on GTA VI cycle |

**Decision Path:** Content creation business where AI is more likely enhancer than disruptor. Premium gaming franchises have strong IP moats. No clear AI disruption thesis.
