Dave and I met with GC Lionetti, OpenAI's Chief Commercial Officer for an hour in SF this afternoon. GC oversees both sales & customer success, and joined OAI 18 months ago; he's very process-oriented and an engineer, which informs a lot of what he's done at OAI to-date. Takeaways: bullish OpenAI -- and Anthropic the trend is enormous & OAI cannot hire fast enough: OAI at ~$5B B2B ARR today (incl self-serve API) growing ~175% YoY Ambition is $15-20B EOY '26 GC acknowledged Anthropic has out-executed OAI on marketing, coding, and MCP/connectors, which are critical components of winning enterprise... "looking for a B2B marketing leader to address this" very bearish public software OAI published a series "Building OpenAI with OpenAI" [ link ] earlier this week that shook the SaaS market highlighted Tailor, a product GC & team created. We discussed how it has changed their own processes at length: many inbound leads are now managed, qualified and sold without any human touchpoint at all...  GC: this is not just for sales, it's an orchestration tool for managing and eval'ing agents across use-cases --> this will be a big disruptor to public SaaS. see sales example [ here ] More on Tailor and Labor Leverage at Oai "we have folks on sales and customer success who spend their entire day just grading the agent (Tailor) on what it's doing to improve performance" GC: only grown headcount +20% in the last year, but more than doubled rep productivity to $5-7M on the back of this and other tools to add ~$3B+ NNARR in B2B.. "but now is time to scale up" sales team gets 10-15K leads per month; 90%+ of these are handled by AI "it's all about removing work from our reps" Startups are a huge part of the ecosystem "no matter how you cut our business, startups are the biggest segment" he called out Cursor, Harvey, and Perplexity on this emphasized that startups represent "a standalone, very important segment.. they're the ones actually going & getting most the revenue in AI " ^ further underscores the headwinds in public SaaS  Partner Ecosystem is a priority channel/integration partners been a headache for OAI forever: they've complained explicitly about Accenture, Bain, Distyl and others, worked to build out an internal team, and now are back around the sun, pushing on partners "my highest priority hire is someone to lead our Partner / Biz Dev revenue efforts" "big enterprises are knocking on our door, wanting to spend $100M; it's new for them but also new for us.. it's something we're all figuring out honestly.. and there are not enough folks to help with this given the need to understand AI, infrastructure, selling, and so much more..." "we have to become a platform, and that means having partners who are building on top of you and selling" sounds like this will be a big emphasis at Dev Day Monday and through end of the year: OAI becoming a platform that developer & partners alike can build and sell solutions on-top-of GC bullish on usage-based pricing, recent change for B2B We switched from seat-based pricing to usage-based because we had to: losing on price to Gemini and Copilot prior to switch "have to be usage based to align on value per price -- I think it's a structural problem with our business model when not priced that way" GC: it's a total land-grab right now; hyper-focused on landing logos and getting wall-to-wall, usage based pricing is the lowest-friction path "I see Google Gemini as the biggest threat to our business" [by alot] views their tech, distribution, G-Suite, and willingness to give on price as a formidable threat --> we'll see GC on Monday at OpenAI Dev Day as well, which Gordon and I are attending. Seems like there will be a lot of talk on coding, API, and partnership ecosystem
OpenAI's Chief Commercial Officer, GC Lionetti, is bullish on OpenAI and Anthropic, with OpenAI's B2B ARR growing ~175% YoY. However, he acknowledges Anthropic's superior execution in marketing, coding, and MCP/connectors. OpenAI's product, Tailor, is disrupting public SaaS by managing, qualifying, and selling inbound leads without human intervention. Startups are the biggest segment of OpenAI's business, with GC Lionetti emphasizing their importance in generating AI revenue.
