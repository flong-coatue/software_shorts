     -     Market Framework and Multiple Compression   Companies facing AI disruption risk significant multiple compression, referencing 2022 as an anchor point when companies like Netflix faced growth concerns.  Terminal value multiples are at risk—if AI threatens long-term earnings, valuations should compress to 10-12x (like "melting ice cube" businesses).  Payments sector precedent: traded at 20x in 2022-2024 despite being viewed as sticky, recurring businesses, now trade at single-digit multiples.  Key insight: don't need negative earnings for compression, just decelerating growth and terminal concerns.   OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) - Primary Short Opportunity  Current Business Model and Economics:   OTAs take ~13% take rate on bookings, generating ~$9B in EBITDA.  Google historically captured $15B in ad revenue from same bookings at 75-80% margins.  Google didn't vertically integrate due to antitrust concerns.  75%+ of Booking's traffic is direct, 25% is indirect (paid)—direct has much better unit economics.   AI Disruption Thesis:   In new AI-agent world, take rates will compress to 3-6% (vs. current 13%) as discovery moves to LLMs.  ChatGPT and other AI agents will handle travel booking directly—easier than building ad business.  Inventory moat is weakening: AI accelerates onboarding of hotels, even small properties.  15% of Booking's room nights come from major chains that could integrate directly with AI platforms.  Sponsored listing revenue (~10% of revenue) disappears as searches move to LLMs.  Marketing costs (30% of costs going to paid search) won't provide offset if bookings decline.   Competitive Dynamics:   Google/Gemini incentives have shifted: now prefer transaction revenue as ad model weakens.  Both Booking and Expedia already integrated with ChatGPT (though implementation is "clunky").  Best case: OTAs become "pipes" at 3-7% take rates.  Worst case: business goes to zero.   Airbnb Specific Considerations:   Slightly more defensible due to individual property owners requiring integration.  However, fundamental disruption thesis still applies.   Conviction Level:   Team views this as "obvious" short with high confidence that economics will be worse in 5 years (possibly 1 year at current pace).  Trading at 18x earnings, which seems expensive given risk.  Can point to real fundamental changes vs. hypothetical disruption.   Gaming and Entertainment Platforms  At-Risk Companies:   Take-Two: AI can replicate work of hundreds of programmers and $400M game development budgets.  Unity: Half the business (game engine) at risk; other half (ads) threatened if mobile gaming changes.  Duolingo: Viewed as "zero".  Roblox: Has issues.  Various game developers (Netease, etc.).   Social Media and Advertising Platforms  Pinterest:   Trades at 27x GAAP '26 earnings, 21x GAAP '27.  Viewed as "zero" as discovery moves to LLMs.  Highest average revenue per daily active user per minute in industry, but no user growth.  Worst engagement of any internet platform (~15 minutes/day vs. 2 hours for TikTok/Meta).  Not a true performance advertising platform.  CEO Bill Reddy was viewed positively but can't overcome fundamental issues.  "Was dead before AI"—AI just accelerates decline.   Reddit:   Users not growing.  60-70% ad revenue growth was backloaded catch-up, mostly brand ads (not performance).  Switching from brand to performance ads is difficult, competing against Meta/TikTok.  Licensing deals may happen once but aren't sustainable.  Core risk: AI agents with access to Gmail, purchase history, texts already know user preferences—don't need Reddit reviews.  New ad supply from OpenAI creates headwinds.  High multiple based on current growth that won't sustain.   Roku:   Platforms become less valuable as agents handle purchasing through ChatGPT/Gemini.  Economics will deteriorate in agent-driven world.  Trading at expensive multiple for "crappy business".  "If Netflix is in the tank, Roku can't do amazing".   E-Commerce and Shopify  Shopify Disruption Thesis:   Trades at infinite P/E, 40x non-GAAP.  Current moat: best platform to build e-commerce website, only charges 2% of GMV (very cheap for all digital infrastructure).  AI disruption risk: If interface shifts from eyeballs to agents, merchants just need API hooks—why build websites?  Anthropic or other AI companies could create "e-commerce ghost kitchens"—just API endpoints for agent purchases.  Analogy: Uber for restaurants vs. Uber for ghost kitchens.  One-click checkout advantage becomes irrelevant if agents handle everything.  OpenAI has "Agent Commerce Protocol" (ACP)—standardized API for processing payments.  Should track ACP adoption as bearish indicator.  Broader principle: any e-commerce company that doesn't do "dirty operations and logistics" is at risk.   Information Services and Data Providers  Core Debate:   Central question: what data is proprietary vs. commoditized, and therefore which businesses are defensible.  Many companies mix data with user interface—question is whether AI disintermediates the UI layer.   Most At-Risk (Commoditized Data):   Thomson Reuters: market data is readily accessible elsewhere.  FactSet: market-oriented platform where data is available from exchanges, quote services.  MarketAxcess.  TradeWeb (debatable).  All are essentially UI layers that people are used to buying (like Bloomberg)—most at risk.  Private market platforms trying to be "Bloomberg for X".   More Defensible (But Still Expensive):   CoStar: Bloomberg for real estate.  MSCI, Moody's: conglomerations of historical data assets.  These stocks are "way too expensive" given potential risk.   Regulatory Moats:   S&P: Ratings business is duopoly, legally required, mission-critical.  CapIQ (part of S&P) only 5% of revenues, rest is protected ratings.  Historically traded at 35-40x, question is whether multiple should compress to 25x given AI uncertainty.  Verisk: Insurance companies pooled data into nonprofit, viewed as impenetrable moat.  Counter-argument: If all insurance companies run on Anthropic, could be better way to use that data.   FactSet Specific Insights:   Team uses Claude/AI tools internally and built caching engine—means FactSet query growth is "comfortable".  Claude Code can find "pretty frickin' good" alternatives to FactSet data.  May not need FactSet subscription if working directly with APIs.   Activist Risk:   High multiples may not attract activists successfully because fixing existential/top-line issues is harder than fixing margins.  Margins already high in these businesses.  CoStar activist letter doesn't address AI.   Publishing/Media   Company (unnamed) missed Q4 expectations and guided below—first time not beating and raising.  Weak margin guidance: telling market they can't guide better than deceleration for 4th consecutive year.  Spending more on AI to stay relevant but margins will stay flat (flat for 4 years already).  Two massive customers trying to leave completely—"canary in coal mine".  Problem: non-tech company investing in AI that will be obsolete in 6 months.  Pricing getting more competitive.  Guided 4-5% organic revenue growth vs. 5-6% this year.  Team deprioritizing this relative to other disruption opportunities with better risk/reward.   Sports Betting   DraftKings/FanDuel: not at risk from AI, only at risk if TV viewing declines.  Handle has been weak, especially FanDuel, based on weekly New York data.  FanDuel also losing market share to DraftKings.  Characterized as "different type of short" but interesting for another discussion.   Investment Strategy and Approach  Prioritization:   Focus on "notable" disruption opportunities with attractive multiples.  OTAs identified as highest priority given clear disruption path and valuation.   Risk Management:   "No floor to the multiples"—last trade request.  Need to avoid getting "shaken out on some 10% squeeze"—must understand direction of travel clearly.  Should size OTA shorts at 3-5% combined if conviction is high.   Key Principle:   Industry executives over 40 will say "it's not a problem"—seen this pattern before.  Need to talk to disruptors (OpenAI, Anthropic integrators) not incumbents.   Position Management:   Team should exit long positions in information services companies first.  Then evaluate which should be shorts.   Action Items  OTA Research:   [ ] Talk to OpenAI team building travel integrations  [ ] Talk to Anthropic integration team  [ ] Talk to head of Shopify growth about OTA landscape  [ ] Reach out to large hotel chains (e.g., Marriott) about putting inventory on OpenAI  [ ] Call Rich Barton for perspective  [ ] Contact Michael again about travel AI and voice-native interface plans   Technology and Data Tracking:   [ ] Track adoption of OpenAI's Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP)  [ ] Work with internet team on tracking various replacement APIs across internet and software  [ ] Get update on internal FactSet usage and alternative data sources   Company Analysis:   [ ] Sprint on Thomson Reuters analysis  [ ] Sprint on FactSet first  [ ] Review Ferris (has software-like assets)  [ ] Come back to software shorts discussion  [ ] Review stocks down 10% for opportunities
