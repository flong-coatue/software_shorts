     -     Meeting Overview  Investment team meeting to discuss 2026 strategy, portfolio positioning, and key investment themes. Discussion covered portfolio construction goals, AI adoption trends, software sector concerns, performance review of 2025, and organizational improvements.  2026 Portfolio Goals and Strategy   Target returns: Hedge fund aiming for +30% (requiring $6B in P&L), with long-only products targeting higher growth  Portfolio construction: Moving toward 80/40 type portfolio with higher gross exposure, targeting 120-150 gross vs. current 80  Diversification approach: Need 25% of long exposure in names uncorrelated to AI with 20-30%+ IRRs to smooth returns during drawdowns  Short book target: Generate $1.5B from shorts (vs. losses in 2025) through 5 great ideas at 2% each, with individual shorts contributing $300-400M  Risk management: Implementing more sophisticated factor and beta matching system with new hire to enable higher gross exposure   AI Enterprise Adoption - Key Bullish Theme   Continual learning unlock: AI agents can now work on tasks over days vs. just hours, enabling true enterprise adoption  Industry validation: Jensen Huang, Lisa Su, and Dario Amodei (Anthropic) all emphasized 2026 as year of enterprise AI adoption  Infrastructure implications: Continual learning requires more memory and chips, bullish for AI supply chain  Coding agents: Massive unlock in last 1.5-2 months, can now rebuild complex systems internally  Model improvements: Next batch of models (trained on Blackwell) expected to show dramatic capability enhancements, initially read as negative for software but bullish for consumer internet and infrastructure   Software/SaaS Sector Concerns   Thesis development: Team working toward 300-500 basis points of short exposure in certain SaaS names  Key concern: Most software growth dollars flowing to AI startups and model companies (Anthropic, OpenAI) rather than incumbent SaaS  Bullish counterargument (from Workday): Companies own critical employee/enterprise data that will be valuable for agents; no customers lost to AI yet  Bearish view: Incremental revenues shrinking as labor savings split between companies and AI providers like Anthropic; product quality from incumbents not good enough (e.g., Salesforce Agent Force vs. Decagon/Sierra)  Research in progress: Conducting comprehensive ecosystem analysis including private equity contacts, sales people at PE-backed software companies, and hyper-growth venture companies to assess quota attainment and dollar flows   Robotics Developments   Hardware progress: Boston Dynamics robot showing exciting progress, commercialization expected 2028  Software challenges: Autonomous learning still slow and poor; robots require control via gloves/suits rather than true autonomy  China positioning: Unitree has good hardware but lacks model expertise and software engineering; potential separation between Chinese hardware and American intelligence  Advisor opportunities: Team meeting with Milan Kovacs (former Tesla FSD head) about humanoid platform; also considering former Boston Dynamics CEO as advisor   2025 Performance Review and Learnings   Hedge fund success: Up nearly 20% gross with only 2% max drawdown and low gross exposure demonstrated strong risk-adjusted returns  Long-only underperformance: Long bias fund underperformed expectations, lacking large positions that tripled (7% position tripling = difference between +20% and +40%)  Short book failures: Crystallized losses on numerous shorts (HIMS, ALAP, AI infrastructure names); inability to outlast volatility cost significant P&L  Gross exposure challenge: Constant grossing up/down due to concentration in AI names limited staying power; need more uncorrelated themes  Private book success: 50-60% ROIC on privates; strong positions in Revolut, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor ($500M position)   Organizational and Team Improvements   AI-native initiative: Frank starting next week to push envelope on AI-native hedge fund operations; two junior analysts (6-9 months post-banking) starting February to test AI-native tech stack  Focus on big calls: Need to separate small decisions (25 bps adds/trims) from big calls ($1B long positions, $300-400M shorts); considering "chief operating officer" for investment staff to handle small decisions  Travel and research: Encourage more proprietary trips with public/private synergies vs. time in office or generic conferences  Risk management: New sophisticated system and personnel to improve factor/beta matching  Mosaic platform: Planning to shrink Mosaic to focus on grid functionality, repurpose rest into OpenAI/Claude interface with mobile support   Sector-Specific Insights   Defense/Aerospace: Up significantly in 2025, represents uncorrelated opportunity  Semiconductors: TSM and semi caps for AI exposure; Synopsis as fallen angel idiosyncratic play  China Tech: ByteDance crushing with 200M users for ChatGPT-equivalent vs. Tencent's 50M; Tencent reinvesting Chinese FCF in US tech stocks rather than competing  China Biotech: 4-6x more patients, less regulation for experimental drug trials, Chinese scientists returning from US; interesting incubator for AI applications with less oversight  Europe: In tough position - hit by Russia, Greenland issues, inadequate military spending, aging workforce, no energy   Axon Investment Thesis (Detailed Discussion)   Core thesis: AI winner with ARPU expansion from $300 to $600+ as police departments adopt AI products  Adoption metrics: 10% of base adopted AI in first 9 months, projected to reach 16% in next 6 months  Key use cases:   Body camera footage auto-translation to reports (reduces officer time from 4-5 hours to 20-30 minutes per day)  Real-time language translation for non-English speakers   ROI validation: 1-1.5 hours of labor savings per week at $60-70/hour officer cost vs. $200/month AI cost  Growth drivers: $1B in drone contracts up for grabs (already $20M of $71M Arizona contract is drones); drone first response, anti-drone defense, taser-equipped drones all coming  Valuation: 14x 2031 P/E, 9x EBITDA on 35%+ growth; expensive near-term but 2.5-3x over 5 years if multiple holds  Competitive position: Category killer, end-to-end supplier, going after Flock directly  Management relationships: Close relationship with CFO (former KKR director who worked with team members)   Action Items   [ ] @Stephen Cho to call Frank about position that was sold  [ ] Each sector team to identify 2-3 idiosyncratic high-quality stories uncorrelated to AI with exposure ready  [ ] Team to identify short list of companies applying AI agents across sectors (financial services, etc.)  [ ] Gordon and team to conduct sales people interviews at private equity software assets and venture companies to assess quota/plan attainment  [ ] Thomas and Max to meet with Milan Kovacs (former Tesla FSD head) about robotics/humanoid platform  [ ] Team to organize retreat and review last year's retreat ideas (e.g., Robinhood)  [ ] Team to prepare comprehensive software ecosystem analysis in next 3 days  [ ] Team to conduct Adobe analysis including shareholder base changes and when value investors entered  [ ] Team to increase Axon position to at least 100 basis points (currently 50 bps), ideal size 200 bps  [ ] Stephen to onboard Frank (starting next week) and two junior analysts (starting February) for AI-native operations
