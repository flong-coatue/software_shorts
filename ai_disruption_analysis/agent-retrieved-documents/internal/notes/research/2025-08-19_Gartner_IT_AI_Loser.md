When asked how AI changes customer usage of Gartner, we heard from many customers that AI is already (negatively) changing their perception or usage: "Absolutely. They're [AI tools] now the starting point for most research instead of Gartner." "We will rely on Gartner insights less as gen AI tools listed here can provide research capabilities. They can also summarize data points effectively allowing absorption of information more effectively. The ability to also research information on the web allows for up to date information." "The value is slightly decreasing because AI tools provide faster access to general insights and summaries. However, Gartner remains essential for validated research, detailed market analysis, and vendor evaluations that AI cannot fully replace." "Decreasing as I think AI will substitute Gartner in the mid term." "Decreasing. I can get equal or better research using CoPilot." "Decreasing because many insights can be articulated by AI very well." "Decreasing as I do think AI is having content that might make Gartner content redundant in long run." "starting to decrease, but Gartner analyst value holds up better than other consulting firms who are clearly increasing their use of AI to deliver contracted deliverables." "Decreasing. As research agents become available, AI is able to provide more timely information about new trends." "Decreasing, AI can help with first set of questions now." "Decreasing as I do think AI is having content that might make Gartner content redundant in long run." "Decreasing... No need of expensive subscription." "Decreasing to the point where it has little to no value." While other customers are more reluctant to change and think Gartner value is unchanged — modal complaint is that hallucinations keep Gartner relevant ( for now! ): "It does not change. The information provided by AI can supplement at best, but for example I cannot take a major decision for investment in a technology based on what AI says." "Staying the same. I think we ChatGPT supplements Gartner at this point rather than competing with it." "The value is slightly decreasing because AI tools provide faster access to general insights and summaries. However, Gartner remains essential for validated research, detailed market analysis, and vendor evaluations that AI cannot fully replace." "AI has no effect on the value or Gartner. Ai can't do the research that Gartner can." "I think the value is currently staying the same - primarily because I suspect Gartner experts are also using AI (and they have more context to better engineer prompts)." "It does not change much, however straightforward research can be done with AI." "AI usage has no impact on any subscription services for now. It is too early to make any such decision." "It does not change. The information provided by AI can supplement at best, but for example I cannot take a major decision for investment in a technology based on what AI says."
We ran a survey of Gartner customers (N=50) all part of the G2K / F500. Results were confirmatory that AI is putting pressure on both seats & pricing for Gartner's core research subscription product. However, it's clear we are still early — survey suggests the core business will slow but it's not yet completely breaking . On average, customers have ~11 Gartner licenses and pay ~$26K per seat. Of the 50 total customers we surveyed, 11 plan to increase their seat count, 26 plan to stay the same, and 13 plan to decrease. Of those planning to decrease, they expect to cut licenses by ~33%, while those increasing only plan to increase by ~16%. This implies a wallet retention rate of 97%, which would be equivalent to the lowest in Gartner history. Last Q, when wallet retention dipped below 100% for the first time since COVID, that was the key driver of the stock declining -30% T+1. We asked the customers who are decreasing licenses to say why they are cutting. The most popular response was "to replace Gartner research with AI," even more than budget constraints or low utilization. This makes sense as 96% of respondents are already using tools like Deep Research in the workplace. We've included some of the qualitative feedback below which showcases how AI is already changing customer perception of Gartner. We think Gartner will be a great AI loser short. We are short ~10bps today and stock has bounced ~6% off the post-earnings lows. At today's price, trades for ~20x Coatue '26 Adj. P/E and ~23x GAAP for what we think will be negligible earnings growth, with the potential to substantially decline as AI eats away at the core. When we re-gross this should be a high priority short to take to ideal size ~100bps. Survey results show that wallet retention for Gartner will inflect lower. This is the key metric which will break the "durable growth" story of the business. On average, Gartner customers have ~11 seats and spend $26K per license. We asked how they expect to change seat and pricing moving forward, and results suggest seat retention of 95% and wallet retention of 97% This is the key KPI that inflected lower last Q to 99%, dipping below 100% for the first time since COVID. If this keeps inflecting lower, will drive the multiple down We'll continue to run this survey and expect this to get worse from here Most common reason customers are cutting seats is to "replace Gartner research with AI," showing that our thesis is just starting to play out. Among customers choosing to cut seats, 32% are doing so to replace Gartner with AI, compared to 20-25% of respondents selecting low utilization, high cost, and budget constraints → said more simply, it's not just the macro, it's AI! See stock details for full-read through of qualitative feedback.
AI pressure on Gartner's core research subscription product, causing slow but not yet complete break. Survey implies a wallet retention rate of 97%, equivalent to the lowest in Gartner history, leading to stock decline. Customers decreasing licenses to replace Gartner research with AI, indicating AI's impact on customer perception of Gartner.
