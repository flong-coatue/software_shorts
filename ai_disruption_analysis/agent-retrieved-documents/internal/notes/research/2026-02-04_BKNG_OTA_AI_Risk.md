Citizens out this AM downgrading BKNG from OW to EW. Whole note is a good summary of the current debates/trends in the OTA landscape (BKNG / EXPE / ABNB). Main takes from their BKNG downgrade below. Stepping back, AI is rapidly shifting the balance of power in the travel ecosystem. OTAs were high-commission toll booths in the old world of search, and I am confident their role and economic value capture will be much smaller in the AI world. We'll be -50bps short each for BKNG + EXPE and are sprinting on calls with players throughout the ecosystem (hotels, OTA formers, tech disruptors, etc.) to make this a bigger bet. AI is a structural risk to OTA Economics OTA direct traffic at risk : AI travel planning / booking tools collapse search funnel. Travel journeys increasingly begin on AI platforms instead of OTA channels. Independent hotels will integrate directly w/ LLMs : Less reliance on OTAs as Model Context Protocol (MCP) and new hotel tech providers connect hotels directly with AI. Lot of players going after this space (Sabre's travel API highlighted here ). Tech infrastructure disadvantage of independent hotels vanishes in AI world. OTA search arbitrage value add at risk : Core OTA value prop in search world was ability to outspend in paid search auctions. This goes away if advertising is no longer primary driver of visibility in AI search Ancillary OTA services less valuable : Part of OTA take rates are justified by tools for things like customer support, yield management, promo optimization, etc. These functions are being increasingly automated/commoditized by AI. Increased competition could pressure OTA take rates over time BKNG growth levers are increasingly penetrated and starting to slow. APAC share gains, loyalty program adoption, hotel + flight bundling, and alternative accommodation share gains from ABNB all becoming less impactful. Good Quotes : "We also view AI as a longer-term risk to the OTA model, as it has the potential to collapse the traditional travel funnel into a single, conversational interface. Although BKNG may continue to surface hotel inventory within AI platforms, we believe this shift could push OTAs further down the value chain, increasing competition and pressuring take rates." "Booking Holdings' TTM B2C direct mix was in the mid-60% as of 3Q25, but we believe AI platforms have the potential to take share of Booking's direct traffic as they becoming the starting point for travel discovery and collapse the online travel funnel into a single, conversational experience. While OTAs may continue to play a role in surfacing hotels within AI-generated results, we believe this pushes them further down the value chain where we believe competition could intensify." "A core source of value for OTAs has been their ability to outspend competitors in paid search auctions, thereby driving incremental demand to hotel partners. That advantage is diminished if advertising is no longer the primary determinant of visibility within AI-driven search results. Even in a scenario where advertising becomes the dominant monetization model for AI platforms, we believe the outcome remains unfavorable for OTA economics. While an ad supported AI environment could preserve some degree of search arbitrage, a shift in consumer discovery toward AI platforms would likely reduce Booking's direct traffic."
AI threatens the OTA model as travel discovery shifts to LLMs, reducing direct traffic and pushing BKNG and EXPE down the value chain where take rate pressure rises. Core OTA advantages in paid search and ancillary services erode as AI collapses the search funnel and commoditizes support and yield tools. BKNG growth drivers such as APAC share gains, loyalty penetration, bundling, and alt‑accom mix are maturing and no longer meaningfully accelerating growth.
