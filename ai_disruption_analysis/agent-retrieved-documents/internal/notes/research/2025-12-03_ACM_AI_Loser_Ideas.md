Ideas from buyside converations at UBS Industrials, focused mainly on shorts. Most are hesitant to be short anything in AI power today but some good potential idiosyncratic names / AI losers coming to surface @mcook  Short ACM [$14B MC / $115M ADV]: Existential AI loser, mgmt communicating that their internal investments across AI (engineers etc.) has high operating leverage, but this ignores impact of market pricing. Contracts are cost-plus where cost = billable hours. More AI efficiencies = fewer billable hours = lower revenue per project (1 engineer vs. 5 for example). Can only be saved w/ outsized share gains or by vastly outpacing mkt growth  Short J [$16B MC / $150M ADV]: Similar thesis to the above but this one is highly debated. If value from AI efficiency in back-end engineering-heavy projects accrues to the customer (e.g., ACM prices lower so J must do so as well to maintain share), market pricing will be a race to the bottom. Only 2% data center exposed today and other segments are single-digit growers. Better mgmt team than ACM and $23B+ backlog make this one harder  Short FRMI [$9B MC / $100M ADV]: Land site in TX claiming to be building 11GW of power including new AP1000s. CEO has a history of fraud and company structured as a REIT but only has a land lease, no assets. Extremely capital intensive with construction + execution risk. No announced customer yet. Stock -50% from IPO earlier this year and is high beta, but potential zero  Short Machinery / Trucks / Ag: Mostly cyclical calls here, down a lot but some thinking we’re not past the worst of it  AGCO [$8B MC / $75M ADV]: Worst inventory overhang in ag equipment. Loser to DE on the first volumes that will come back in NA and have been bleeding market share across regions. Still under-producing but negative leverage on costs has been worse than expected, hesitant to take out costs entirely given optimism on a near-term cycle turn  CNH [$12B MC / $125M ADV]: European Ag Equipment mfg stuck without order volume at macro level and replacement cycle pushed to 2027+. AI offerings are good but sold as one-time vs. subscription-level like DE.  CMI [$70B MC / $475M ADV]: Short pitch is on truck OEM volumes likely to continue seeing huge declines exiting this year and bleeding lower into next, decremental margins on core business will get worse (mgmt saying they can pass along incremental costs from tariffs but no price leverage in negative demand environment). We see another leg to this pitch related to backup gen / behind-the-meter power for data center which has driven the stock +45% this year   View in Slack
