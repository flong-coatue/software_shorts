Recapping day one of India IT services trip. @svishnupad and I met with LTIM ( 5th largest India IT services player by market cap ), TCS ( 2nd largest player behind INFY ), Hexaware ( faster growing tier 3 player ), and had lunch with local buyside. We walked away increasingly convinced that many of these companies will not survive in an AI Agent world. For the first time, these players are openly talking about decoupling revenue growth from headcount growth, and every single company affirmed the need to transform their pricing model from time-and-materials ( PxQ, 60-70% of IT services revenues today ) to a fixed-price / outcome based model. We believe this will be massively deflationary as there is a race-to-the-bottom on price to see who can offer the deepest discounts. Sub-scale players like LTIM/Hexaware are leaning into this change as they have less legacy BPO presence to lose, while established market leaders like TCS are more defensive given they face an “innovator’s dilemma” around cannibalizing their base. Biggest incremental thesis point is around global capability centers (GCCs). These are where large enterprises in-source their BPO and open their own office in India, saving the 30-35% gross margin that IT services firms capture today. Local buyside said that their real estate checks revealed massive acceleration in GCCs — one firm said they leased out enough office space for 500K employees (the entire size of TCS) in the last 12 months. This puts even more secular pressure on these firms to reduce price. We are meeting with two more tier 2 players today (TECHM, MPHL) and then flying to Bangalore to meet with INFY, Wipro, and tour the Goldman Sachs GCC. More updates to come.  Many companies are still blaming the growth slowdown on macro. But universally we’re hearing price concessions are moving higher because of AI.   “The weak macro means we’re having to bake bigger AI-productivity discounts into bids just to hold share.” — LTIM  “Peers are suddenly extremely aggressive on pricing; the macro shock is pushing them to concede upfront, betting AI efficiencies will pay back later.” — TCS  “Pricing pressure is real—partly macro for now, yet everyone’s treating AI as the reason to cut like-for-like rates.” — Hexaware   Everyone acknowledges the business model needs to change from PxQ to fixed-price/outcome-based pricing. This will be deflationary near-term as the IT services firm wears the risk of delivering AI efficiencies up-front.   “T&M is fading; outcome-based will dominate within a decade, and whoever delivers the biggest AI savings keeps the upside.” — LTIM  “We expect most engagements to migrate to fixed-price outcome models; clients want budget certainty while we shoulder the risk.” — TCS  “Roughly 60-70 % of our work is still T&M, but the mix is rapidly tilting to fixed-price—which should lift margins over the long-run if we execute. — Hexaware   Competitive landscape is worse than it’s ever been. Tier 2/3 firms are able to bid way below established players like INFY/TCS as they (1) have no legacy BPO business to lose and (2) can be more nimble with AI.   “Competitive environment is definitely elevated—three years ago there was enough work for everyone, now peers are over-stepping and taking risks just to win deals.” — LTIM  “I’m seeing real aggression from smaller vendors; when procurement is only about price, we lose.” — TCS  “Channel checks show five-to-six times more tier-2/3 bidders on every contract; they can slash rates because they don’t have a legacy BPO profit pool to defend.” — Local buyside   Local buyside are more skeptical on structural vs. cyclical debate. Frankly, the IT services firms are both (1) growing faster and (2) less expensive than most stocks in India. But this tell us there’s still room for domestic selling as the AI thesis plays out in numbers.   “Right now the slowdown looks mostly macro, not AI, when we line up IT-services revenue against their customers’ sales.” — Kora Cap  “Indian IT names are growing faster and trading cheaper than most local stocks, yet positioning is bearish after a three-year-high bout of selling.” — Local MF  “Global investors aren’t buying Indian IT for the AI story—they care more about a cyclical recovery—so domestic holders could still lighten up if numbers lag.” — GS Head of Equity Sales India   Acceleration in GCC is yet another battle IT services providers need to fight. Insourcing of BPO eats into their margins and is easier now that most large enterprises already have a major presence in India.   “We’ve launched ‘GCC-as-a-service’ because if we don’t, clients will build it themselves—an opportunity but also cannibalization.” — LTIM  “The pace of GCC roll-outs has shot up in the past two years; leased space now equals a 500k-employee workforce.” — Kora Cap  “Clients want to pull the 30-35 % gross margin we earn into their own GCCs, especially for infra and ops work.” — Hexaware   View in Slack
