Overall ESG Score EME: B
New long QI on EME (EMCOR) as ONLY labor player delivering GW-scale data center complexes AND semifab mfg facilities in the US. EME is the #1 scaled electrical & mechanical (MEP) contractor in the country currently undergoing a transitioning from old-world construction end markets to specialized data center and semifab development, which has quickly ramped from 0% to 40% of EBIT over the last two years. We already know that labor is a bottleneck across the data center supply chain and the market has placed its bets behind pure-play contractors (e.g., FIX) as the clearest beneficiary. While EME has quickly ramped its data center biz to 25% of EBIT, the MOST exciting part of this story is their 100% win rate building new facilities for TSMC, Intel, Micron, and Samsung, all of which are signaling MASSIVE capex commitments for new capacity builds in the US. If we are believers in a massive inflection in semifab + greenfield memory capex, EME is a direct beneficiary with the scale to take on projects today. Skilled labor WILL be a core area of supply/demand tension for these builds and smaller players can't execute at this scale. Within the labor theme, we see the most value in stories indexed to areas of spend where we have the most differentiated view vs. the street --> combo of MTZ (gas infra) and EME (data center + semifab) is a BFI where upside is DIRECTLY correlated to areas where we are the smartest on the street. $500M of ADV between the two, can be a 3-4% bet for us with huge upside to consensus numbers. What is EME? $33B MC skilled labor contractor; $300M ADV; 26x NTM Street EPS #1 share player in data center and semifab mechanical and electrical (MEP) contracting 100% win rate building mfg facilities for largest semis customers in the world (TSMC, Intel, Micron, Samsung) Hyperscaler pure-play (100% win rate w/ META) for large-scale data center campuses; 2.5GW under construction Thesis: #1 share EPC building largest infrastructure projects in history Top share player quickly transitioning business from traditional construction --> data center and semifab construction EME is a historically sleepy EPC providing mechanical and electrical labor (electricians, welders, HVAC) to large-scale infrastructure projects In the last two years, has pivoted focus to data center + semis customers with massive early wins across AAA customer base Took business from ~0% revenue exposure to data center + semis in 2023 to ~25% today, with margins >2x higher vs. traditional business We know that skilled labor is short and data center demand will consume the VAST majority of industry capacity --> this is appreciated, but NO ONE is modeling the ramp in semifab capex The street has begun to appreciate the "labor shortage" theme through a very cursory lens --> GWs of data centers being built and $ of construction spend required to deliver While we maintain an above-street view on DC builds, much of the excitement has been priced into buyside's favorite names (e.g. FIX, 38x NTM P/E) The REAL differentiation on EME that no one is talking about is its 100% share of semifab capex which is inflecting in real-time! This is an even bigger order of magnitude ramp vs. data centers which EME has a right to win at >10x multiple discount Greenfield semifab (and specifically memory) capex is accelerating in real-time and is an unprecedented upcycle --> we have a highly differentiated / leading-edge view vs. the street Customer roster in semis capex consists of the four largest AAA names investing heavily in the US We see a $250B opportunity related to JUST construction spend in the US that EME is in the pole position to win EME is building on early success --> won #1 share MEP contract for TSMC's Arizona facility, Intel's Ohio facility, Micron's Idaho and NY fabs, and Samsung's TX facility Sellside AND buyside are completely ignoring the opportunity available to EME related to semis capex, and likely underestimating the data center opportunity EME has historically reported at a broad segment level, but recently improved disclosure to show revenues by end segment, including Network + Comms (data center) and High-Tech Manufacturing (semis) No one models these lines separately OR takes a top-down view on the opportunity We can conservatively model to 100% above the street in 2029/2030, and expect we are just at the beginning of massive US capex announcements in semifab specifically What could this be? Street entirely underestimates the inflection coming in EME's two growth end markets We model to $80 in 2030 EPS vs. street at $40 --> (24% CAGR vs. street at 10%) 3x MOIC / 30% IRR exiting at undemanding 25x P/E Next Steps Meet CEO / CFO with PL and JR Connect with buyside peers who cover the labor universe to understand their view on DC and semis end segments Broad expert search to validate 100% win rate with AAA semis customers can sustain
EME rapidly shifted from legacy construction to DC and semifab work with these segments rising from ~0% to ~40% of EBIT and carrying >2x historical margins. EME holds a 100% win rate with TSMC, INTC, MU, Samsung and META and is positioned for a major US semifab capex inflection that the street is not modeling. Firm models 24% EPS CAGR to 2030 vs street at 10% with potential 3x MOIC at a 25x exit multiple.
