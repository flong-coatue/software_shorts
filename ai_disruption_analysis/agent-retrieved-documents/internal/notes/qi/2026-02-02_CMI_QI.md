Overall ESG Score CMI: C
Pitching CMI as fake AI Infra winner (and good hedge against our AI Infra winners in Gas and Labor). Stock is at ATHs +63% in L6M and +13% YTD on perceived future growth of their backup diesel generator business which makes up only 10% and even less as a % of EBIT today. While the stock has ripped on "datacenter exposure in Industrials", we are confident that backup diesel generators are being designed out of future datacenters, specifically Crusoe Abilene and xAI Memphis don't use them at all.  Traditional industrial analysts don't know this, and continue to model 30-35% top-line growth for datacenter business. As % penetration of diesel generators moves to 0%, CMI will be left as a diesel truck engine manufacturer with long-term AV risk (TSLA Semi) currently trading at 20x+ P/E vs. 5-year average of 14x.  Current stock price implies the datacenter EPS is trading at >70x NTM P/E.  We see 30% downside in this name that trades $500M ADV today. What is CMI?  $80B MC, $500M ADV, 22x '26 P/E, +63% in L6M, +13% YTD OEM of diesel truck engines as well as 30% share of diesel backup generator market Datacenter backup engines ~10% of revenue growing 30-35% y/y, engines and components 90% of revenue Thesis:  Next-Gen Datacenter Loser CMI is +60% in L6M as P/E went from 12x to 22x on datacenter hype, EEB hasn't moved Data center backup was $2.6B of revenue in '24 --> $3.4-3.5B in '25 (+30-35% y/y) --> $4.5B+ in 2026E. Going from 7% of total CMI revenue in '24 --> 10% in '25 --> 12% in '26 with margins actually below the core business Even at a continued 30-35% CAGR at 17% EBIT margins, diesel generators will still be <20% of total EBIT by 2028 However, backup diesel generators are being designed out of future datacenters (OAI, Anthropic) While previous generation datacenters required backup diesel generators 1:1 to overall power draw, future designs are being built using: (1) 2 primary interconnections for redundancy (i.e. having 2 separate utility hookups), or (2) nat-gas turbines / mobile gas gen as backup SemiAnalysis recent note points out that Crusoe Abilene and xAI Memphis both skipped backup generators -- "improved networking and workload mobility across sites is further reducing the need for full diesel redundancy" "Public filings, investigative reporting, and the facility's most‑recent air‑quality permit show that xAI's Memphis "Colossus" data‑center complex relies on natural‑gas turbines and mobile gas generators—plus large Tesla Megapack battery banks—for standby and bridging power, not diesel sets" And core diesel engine market faces existential headwind with AV trucking, TSLA AV launch near-term negative catalyst Scaled production of TSLA Semi and other autonomous alternatives to Class 8 diesel trucks will be negative catalysts in '26 Accelera, Zero-emission business unit has been money-losing for years. Focused on battery packs, hydrogen fuel cells, and electrolyzers. Lost $500M in 2024 (~$4 of EPS) and $400M expected in '25 On SOTP, the implied NTM P/E multiple on the datacenter EBIT is >70x P/E (!) Datacenter will make up ~10% of revenue/EBIT in '25, or about $3.50 of EPS on our $23 of EPS If we apply a mid-cycle multiple (17x) to the core business, implies datacenter trading at 73x NTM P/E If we instead give it a full trough multiple (20x) on the core, still implies datacenter trading at an absurd 50x NTM P/E What could this be and risks? On Coatue '27 EPS of $30 x 13x = $415 stock --> -30% downside Only risk is inflection of the truck newbuild cycle. But even there, don't see much upside at this valuation. CMI is ABOVE a trough multiple at 22x right now. Typical through-cycle average is 12-15x P/E and earnings can expand +30-50% from trough to mid-cycle. Taking street '27 estimates of $31.75 x 20x which would be VERY generous = $635 stock --> +10% upside risk from here Next Steps Speak with datacenter developer contacts to understand future demand / scope for backup diesel gensets (fmr Crusoe advisor, DayOne, Aligned) Ask each competitor how they are approaching the market given design-out coming
CMI’s rerating from 12x to 22x P/E is driven by DC hype despite DC backup gensets being only ~10% of rev and growing 30–35% y/y with margins below core and still <20% EBIT mix by 2028. Future DC designs at OAI, Anthropic, xAI and Crusoe are phasing out diesel redundancy in favor of dual-grid, nat‑gas, and batteries, undermining CMI’s perceived AI Infra exposure. Core diesel engines face AV risk from TSLA Semi while loss‑making zero‑emissions units persist, implying DC EPS valued at >70x NTM P/E and ~30% downside vs mid‑cycle multiples.
