EXPD faces pressure from lower ocean container shipping rates while stability in airfreight rates points to roughly flat airfreight net revenue in 4Q. We believe the customs/ other category is a key lever for upside which supports our 4Q EPS estimate of $1.49/share compared to Consensus of $1.42/share. EXPD remains a debated name where overall investor sentiment is skeptical. Against this backdrop, we believe an upside 4Q report provides a catalyst for a further move up in EXPD stock.

EXPD's growth in customs / other net revenue accelerated to 16.9% y/y growth in 3Q compared to 10.2% and 8.6% y/y in 2Q and 1Q. We are modeling a deceleration to 10.9% y/y growth in 4Q which is above Consensus at 8.3%. EXPD has pointed to continuing momentum in 4Q in terms of ramping up with new customers and also seeing additional drivers of activity with existing customers. As a result, we believe our 4Q assumption may be conservative. Ocean is a clear headwind and we model net revenue of -22.8% y/y (vs Street at -23.2%) while air appears likely to be more of a neutral impact. We model airfreight net revenue -1.0% y/y vs Consensus of +1.5%.

Looking to 2026, we believe Consensus ($5.99/sh) and our own forecast of $6.00/sh set a reasonable bar which reflects significant pressure in ocean net revenue (we forecast 17.6% y/y), very modest growth of 2.0% in airfreight (our model) and also a reasonable bar of +4.9% growth in customs / other revenue. We believe EXPD could benefit in an environment of fewer tariffs from stronger performance in its airfreight and ocean businesses. A backdrop of fewer tariffs could be a headwind to EXPD's customs / other business but it also appears very possible that replacing IEEPA tariffs with other tariffs could support similar or even greater activity for EXPD in its customs business.

We apply a 24x P/E to our 2027 EPS estimate of $6.90/share to derive our price target of $166. We expect an upside 4Q to support EXPD stock and we continue to believe the medium term story is attractive. We rate EXPD Buy.

We believe an investor concern around the outlook for EXPD is lower ocean rates, which could pressure net revenue in 2026. Ocean spot rates are tracking down ~48% y/y in 4Q according to the Drewry World Container Index (WCI). The supply / demand setup for the ocean market in 2026 & 2027 is challenging, with U.S. container imports potentially declining mid single digits y/y following tariff-related volume pull forward this year (link). Using our regression analysis of ocean spot rates (advanced 5 months) and EXPD's ocean net revenue per unit (r^2 =87%), we estimate that ocean net revenue per unit could decline 17% y/y in 4Q25. If we also factor in 7% lower ocean volumes for EXPD, then our ocean net revenue estimate declines ~23% y/y in 4Q25, which is roughly in line with Consensus estimates. For 2026, our ocean net revenue estimate of $643 mm is 12% below

Consensus of $730 mm. Figure 1: EXPD Ocean Net Revenue Per Unit Adjusts To Ocean Spot Rates With A ~5 Month Lag Source: Drewry, Company Reports, and UBS Analysis and Estimates

In 3Q, EXPD's airfreight net revenue of $253 mm was ~9% above our estimate as net revenue per unit was -1.2% y/y vs. our expectation of a -4.5% decline. We estimate that it takes 1 month for EXPD to pass through higher airfreight capacity costs to shippers and realize stronger net revenue performance. We note airfreight spot rates were relatively strong & stable (vs. difficult y/y comps) in October (-2.4%) and November (0.9%) as demand was driven by peak season and front-loading cargo ahead of potential tariff increases. Given the recent findings and using our regression analysis of airfreight spot rates (advanced 1 month) and EXPD's airfreight net revenue per unit (r^2 =94%), we estimate that airfreight net revenue per unit could decline 1% y/y in 4Q25.

If we also factor flat airfreight volumes for EXPD, then our airfreight net revenue estimate declines ~1% y/y, which is less than the Consensus estimate of +1.5% growth.

In Figure 3, below, we compare our model assumptions for EXPD vs. Consensus in 4Q25, 2026 and 2027. Relative to Consensus, we are modelling 2.5% lower airfreight net revenue. We note, however, that it is offset by our higher customs brokerage net revenue growth estimate (10.9% vs. Consensus of 8.3%) and slightly higher operating margin. With regard to 2026, our EPS estimate is at $6.00, in line with Consensus. When looking at our estimates vs. Consensus, we believe ocean net revenue could decline ~18% vs. -6% modelled by the Street. For 2027, our EPS estimate is $6.90 / share, which is 3% above Consensus of $6.69. Our model reflects a modest recovery in air and ocean rates, resulting in 3% airfreight net revenue growth and 6% ocean net revenue growth. We also believe that headcount cost reduction could results in a 30% operating margin for 2027, 150 bps better than Consensus estimate.

EXPD is one of the leading global freight forwarders, with notable leverage to the Asia / US trade lane and a strong service offering of airfreight and ocean forwarding, customs brokerage and the ability to offer door-to-door service offerings.

Our price target is based on a multiple of EPS. EXPD's primary services are facilitation of international airfreight and ocean movements of freight and provision of customs brokerage and local transport services connected to the international moves. As a result, EXPD's growth is sensitive to the pace of growth in international airfreight and ocean container moves. Faster global economic growth than we currently anticipate - accompanied by stronger growth in global trade than we currently anticipate - is an upside risks to EXPD's markets, its growth and EPS, and our price target. As an intermediary, EXPD also passes along changes

in airfreight and ocean container capacity costs; so if these markets loosen and prices fall quickly (separate from changes in demand growth) this could also cause upside to our EPS estimates and our price target for EXPD. While EXPD does not own the transport assets (planes, ships, etc.), it does have operating leverage in terms of its labor, facilities, and G&A costs. As a result, faster growth in net revenue than we currently anticipate could cause upside pressure on EXPD's operating margin and EPS performance. The international freight forwarding markets are highly competitive, but an easing in competitive pressures is a source of potential upside risk.
