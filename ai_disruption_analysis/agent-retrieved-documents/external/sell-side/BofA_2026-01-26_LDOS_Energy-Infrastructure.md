Price objective basis & risk Leidos Holdings (LDOS) Our PO of $235 is based on 0.9x relative EV/EBITDA multiple to the defense primes on 2026 estimates. We think a multiple slightly below the primes fairly reflects the near-term pricing pressure from transitioning some managed services programs to more commercial-terms and the opportunities at defense systems, healthcare, and border security. This equals a 13.5x EV/EBITDA. Downside risks to our PO are: cuts to the US Government budget vs. anticipated, increased competition from non-traditional players, problems integrating M&A, hiring the right personnel, containing its costs, estimating costs and executing on fixed price contracts, sustaining reputational risk and future awards. Upside risks to our PO are: a better than anticipated federal budget allocated to innovative technologies and modernization, inexpensive and well integrated M&A activity, unexpected capital return to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks, market share gains, better than expected margin expansion.
