LDOS - Entrust Acquisition Provides Double The Power Overall, we think LDOS's acquisition of Entrust [link] is a quality start to what we expect to be a busy year for M&A/portfolio shaping at the company. The energy sector is a small but fastgrowing (low-to-mid teens) and high margin (mid-teens) piece of LDOS. We like the deal on (1) overall spending expectations for the utilities industry; (2) immediate expected sales growth/margin accretion; and (3) potential synergy/cross-selling opportunities. We also don't see pro forma post-close leverage (~2.6x) as an impediment to more NT M&A activity.

The deal provides significant scale and engineering resources to LDOS's energy business. We note the typical contract structure with utilities is a Master Service Agreement (MSA), which involves mostly T&M and some fixed price work. The total contract length can vary widely and is most analogous to an IDIQ, but with shorter duration task orders. The company emphasized the complementary nature of the two businesses. Even across similar customers, LDOS and Entrust typically provide different services. We like the potential for cross-selling, incl. LDOS bringing cyber/IT services to Entrust's customers. Overall, we think utilities' spending is likely to further increase in the LT given expected domestic power needs.

We think LDOS could pursue further M&A/portfolio shaping in the coming year. The company's strong balance sheet and the pro forma post-close leverage should provide solid financial flexibility for NT deals. The CFO Chris Cage pointed to a potentially active year for acquisitions/divestitures during our December bus tour. We think LDOS could pursue expansion in the defense sector next to bolster capabilities ahead of OBBBA funding. We estimate the deal multiple is 16x post-synergies, based on a ~23% margin assumption for the Entrust business. We think the multiple is justified given the Entrust's midteens growth rate and synergistic potential. LDOS noted immediate expected accretion for revenue growth and EBITDA margins from the deal. Adj. EPS accretion would start in 2027. While no specifics were provided, mgmt. highlighted "tens of millions" of potential synergy flowthrough to the bottom line.

LDOS has agreed to acquire Entrust Solutions Group (Private) for $2.4B, with expected closing in 2Q26. The deal will be financed by a combination of cash on hand ($500M), new debt ($1.4B), and commercial paper ($500M). The company expects a leverage ratio of 2.6x post-close. Entrust will approximately double the size of LDOS's existing energy business to ~$1.3B in combined sales. Energy currently makes up ~4% of LDOS's portfolio. The company forecasts high-teens EBITDA margins for the combined business incl. potential synergies.

Entrust is a consulting, design, and EPC firm for NA energy infrastructure. The company is owned by Kohlberg (Private), a middle-market PE company. Entrust has a sizable mix in the gas T&D business as well as electrical power gen work, where LDOS currently has no exposure. The combination would make LDOS the third largest T&D design company in the US, and the fourth largest power design firm. The two leading players in the space are WSP (WSP-CA, NR) and Burns & McDonnell (Private). The deal keeps LDOS out of energy construction work, something the company has shown no interest in.

Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS) is the holding company for the operating entity, Leidos, Inc. Leidos provides applied technology solutions and services in the national security, health and infrastructure engineering markets and provides services in areas of signals intelligence, advanced sensing phenomenology, intelligence collection methods, life sciences and power grid engineering. Leidos operates on three core areas of technical expertise: data analytics, systems engineering and cybersecurity. The company provides services to government and commercial customers both domestically and internationally, but the primary customer is the U.S. Government. Leidos serves the U.S. Department of Defense ('DoD'), the intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), other U.S. Government civil agencies, and state and local government agencies. The company is expanding into the international government and broader commercial markets.

We believe LDOS should grow faster than overall federal budget spending due to significant exposure in more attractive areas including IT modernization, healthcare, cyber, hypersonics, space and C4ISR/C5ISR. In our view, the expected ramp on a number of large IT contracts, faster-growing hardware businesses and a diverse services portfolio should provide a favorable backdrop relative to other government contractors. We look for management to remain aggressive adding higher-margin solutions to the portfolio. We rate the shares Buy.

We value Leidos shares based on following methods: (1) price/earnings multiples and (2) enterprise value multiples. Price to Earnings Multiples - Using earnings multiples, we focus on forward-looking price to earnings metrics. The company has historically traded at a 17.8x multiple average since the split into Leidos in September 2013, while the peer group of defense service providers currently trades at ~13x. Assuming Leidos' multiple increases to 18.6x in the next twelve months, and using our 2026E adjusted EPS estimate of $11.81, we arrive at a $220/share valuation. Enterprise Value to EBITDA Multiples - Peers in the defense services space sector currently trade at ~11x to 2026E EBITDA on average while Leidos' historical mean multiple has been 11.2x since the split. We expect Leidos' current multiple to trend to 13.8x. Using our estimated 2026E adjusted EBITDA of $2,376M, (including expected FCF) we arrive at a valuation of $220/share.

Valuation Summary - Using these methods, we come to value Leidos shares at $220 per share in the next 12 months. Given the enduring opportunity for growth in healthcare, cyber and intelligence, we believe the company will continue to experience solid growth in the government services sector.

· Protests and legal challenges filed against LDOS's large contract wins may be resolved unfavorably. · Future defense spending trajectories could be impacted by recent stimulus measures. · Timing of recent large contract ramps could disappoint relative to Street expectations. · International operations could expose LDOS to potential legal and regulatory risks, including FCPA violations. · Government shutdowns or extended continuing resolutions could negatively impact the company's operating results.
