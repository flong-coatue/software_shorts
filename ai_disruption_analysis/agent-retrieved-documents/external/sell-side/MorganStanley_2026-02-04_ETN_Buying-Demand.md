While Bears have been able to poke holes in the ETN story in recent months Americas segment missing, Unclear margin path forward, Questions on Boyd value creation - there is no debate on demand w/ Q4 orders once again inflecting above expectations (Americas +45% MSe). And while the demand for ETN products has never been greater, the relative valuation for the equity has fallen to multi-year lows - so while Bear concerns on the unclear margin bridge + longer-term pricing power have merit, we

see this risk more than priced into the de-rated multiple. To this point, ETN continues to offer the cheapest source of credibly HSD organic growth across US Industrials - and following the 2H'25 order inflection, we feel more confident in the ability for the company to sustain HSD organic over a multi-year period … and that should be positive for the multiple. While ETN conversations have centered on margins over the last 6mo, the longer-term debate has been on the durability of organic growth and this will once again be the focus should capacity-related margin headwinds shift into the rearview over the NTM. And it will be harder to take the negative side of that into 2027 w/ a pro forma portfolio consisting of ~75% Electrical, 15% Aero and ~10% Liquid Cooling mix that makes HSD organic look like a conservative bar . Maintain OW, PT to $425. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

· Q1 Margins screen for upside: ETN is guiding Q1 margins down 250 bps Q/ Q, much steeper than the typical ~75 bps step down. The pressure is a function of Americas capacity adds w/ the segment guided to ~27% OM in Q1, down 280 bps vs Q4 (vs typical ~100 bps). We see potential upside and note the Q4 OM base already incurred a good deal of capacity-related margin headwinds - Americas Q4 OM turned down ~180 bps YoY vs Q3 +20 bps YoY. While ETN likely has incremental projects ramping up in 1H'26 vs 2H'25, we would think the 2H'25 facility starts begin to see better utilization / absorption.

· Americas Organic screens for upside: Our math pegs 2H Americas orders up in the ~35% YoY range, a strong ramp relative to the FY'26 ~10% organic growth guide. The guide seems to peg 2H'26 Americas organic below 1H'26 levels - a potential source of upside as capacity adds unlock higher volumes and should offset easing price contribution. In addition, Fibrebond turns organic in Q2 and should prove accretive to overall ETN organic. Exhibit 2 : ETN Electrical Americas TTM orders pushed to +16% in Q4, above +7% in Q3 and MSe +12% - our math pegs Q4 quarterly orders at a very robust +45% yoy. Demand for ETN products has never been better, yet the multiple has de-rated and that is the opportunity Source: Morgan Stanley Research, Company reports M

Coming out of Q4'25, we raise our PT to $425 from $405 prior after updating estimates and marking-to-market our multiple. Our $425 PT is based on ~27.5x our 2027 EPS estimate of $15.50. The multiple represents a mid-20s % premium to the S&P and low-teens % premium to peers, ahead of current levels but in line with the 3yr average. While near-term performance should remain impacted by capacity ramp-up headwinds, ETN should continue to post HSD+ organic growth, and we believe this, alongside a return to margin expansion as capacity comes on line, should support premium valuation, with the outlook further supported by continued order acceleration and backlog build on historical demand.

Estimates: We model Q1'26 EPS at $2.75 ($2.65-$2.85 guide) driven by 6.5% organic growth (5-7% guide) and 22.4% segment margin (22.2-22.6% guide). This contributes to our full-year 2026 EPS forecast of $13.24 ($13.00-$13.50 guide) on 7.8% organic (4-9% guide) and 24.5% segment margin (24.6-25.0% guide). While organic should persist at HSD in 2026, incrementals likely step back further to mid- to high-20s, dragged by capacity investments and ramp-up. We expect incrementals bounce back in 2027, though, pushing close to 40% as ETN catches up on recent underperformance and gets volume leverage on new capacity. The demand profile remains robust, supported by secular tailwinds (Data Center, Reshoring), and elevated backlogs and durable pricing power give us confidence in continued top-line growth.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ('Morgan Stanley') is acting as financial adviser to Eaton Corporation ("Eaton") in connection with the potential separation of its Vehicle and eMobility segments (together, 'Mobility Group' or 'Mobility') as announced on January 26, 2026. Eaton has agreed to pay fees to Morgan Stanley for its financial services. Please refer to the notes at the end of the report. M

PT applies a ~27.5x multiple to blended CY'27 EPS of $15.50. The multiple represents a low teens % premium to peers, above current levels but in range with recent history, as sectorleading sustained HSD organic growth and a return to margin expansion should support premium valuation.

▪ As the leading provider of Electrical Systems in the US, ETN offers the strongest & broadest set of secular drivers across US Industrials - including US Reshoring (favored name on theme), AI / Data Center build-out, Utility/Infrastructure & broad-based Electrification. ▪ ETN brings significant leverage to our call for an extended capex upcycle; we forecast sustained HSD% organic growth through 2027 vs Consensus, which calls for return to MSD. ▪ ETN has grown EPS at a 20% CAGR over the last 4yrs and the debate now is all about durability - we are positive on key secular drivers to be multi-decade opportunities and on a micro level, ETN continues to build backlog & orders have returned to growth.

We forecast a return to LDD growth in 2026 w/ Electrical Americas holding low-teens while Electrical Global ramps to M-HSD and Aero averages LDD. We model eMobility organic accelerating to the 35% target by 2027 on new model launches. We forecast mid- to high-30% incrementals, a strong mark but well below 2024 levels. Our ~31.5x multiple represents a ~30% premium to peers, moving towards peak levels, supported by re-accelerating organic growth and a ~20% EPS CAGR.

We assume steady HSD% organic through 2027 but below 2022/23 levels as comps get tougher and pricing moderates. We model continued LDD organic for Elec Americas, supported by close alignment with megatrends and record backlog. We model Elec Global ramping to MSD and Aero easing to M-HSD. We model 25%+ incrementals in 2026 before recovering to 30%+ as capacity comes online. Our ~27.5x multiple represents a mid 20% premium to the S&P, above current levels but in range with recent history.

We model organic decelerating to MSD, assuming Americas decelerates sharply on project delays & backlog burn along w/ cont'd softness for Electrical Global on soft EU + APAC macro. With softer volumes & pricing power, we forecast high 20% incrementals following the 35-40% average mark in 2023-24. Our ~21x multiple represents a MSD % discount to the S&P, well below the LT average high teens % premium, as a sharp organic deceleration drives material derating. M
