1Q Beat Despite Lower FX Volatility and Higher Marketing Spend

Visa delivered a solid 1QFY26, with revenue and earnings modestly ahead of Street expectations. Opex was slightly higher than expected in the quarter, and the 2QFY26 opex growth guide at the high end of mid-teens exceeded consensus. Positively, Visa maintained its full-year FY26 opex outlook and continues to expect adjusted opex growth in low-double-digits. Meanwhile, International revenue rose 6%, modestly below expectations due to lower FX volatility and negative mix. Positively, consumer spend trends were consistent with 4Q, led by continued strength in the highest-spend band. Visa saw no deterioration in the lower band, and both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories remained healthy. Visa continues to be well-positioned to gain share in the long-term shift from paper to card-based payments. Visa remains one of our top ideas.

■ 1QFY26 non-GAAP EPS increased 15% YoY to $3.17, $0.02 above our forecast after adjusting for differences in below-the-line items versus our model. Street estimated $3.14. Net revenue rose 13% on a constant-dollar basis to $10.9B, above our and Street estimate of $10.7B. Non-GAAP operating income of $7.51B was above Street's $7.42B estimate. Opex rose 16%, modestly above expectations given an unfavorable FX impact and higher-than-expected marketing. ■ Cross-border volume grew 12%, matching 4QFY25 and our estimate. Crossborder e-commerce volume grew 12%, slightly below Q4, primarily from lower growth in cryptocurrency purchases.

Processed transactions grew 9%, vs. 10% in 4QFY25. Value-added services revenue grew 28% in CC, accelerating from 25% in 4QFY25, and represented ~50% of overall revenue growth in 1QFY26. Client incentives were $4.27B, below our $4.39B estimate and consensus' $4.33B estimate .

■ Constant dollar payments volume increased 8% , down slightly from 9% in 4QFY25, and below our estimate. Both credit and debit volume grew 8%. QTD constant metrics displayed resilience. Through 1/21, US payments volume grew 8%, up slightly from 7% in 1QFY26. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 11%, matching 1QFY26. Meanwhile, processed transactions increased 9%, matching 1QFY26. ■ FY26 guide was largely unchanged, except that non-GAAP adjusted EPS on a nominal basis was now targeted at the high end of low double-digits vs. low doubledigits previously. For 2QFY26, Visa targets nominal-dollar revenue growth at the high end of low double-digits vs. consensus' 12%E, opex growth at the high end of mid-teens vs. Street's 13%E and EPS growth at the high end of low double-digits vs. Street's 11%E.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS/FINTECH

■ Global real GDP growth remains ~3%, resulting in resilient consumer spending ■ USD remains at current levels with minimal currency headwinds persist ■ Cross-border volume growth remains stable

■ Global economic trends improve, driving accelerating purchase volume growth ■ Asia Pacific economy improves faster than expected, driving improved cross-border growth ■ V announces incremental price increases ■ Regulatory issues resolve in favor of Visa

We derive our $391 price target by applying a 27x target P/E multiple to our FY27E EPS. We believe a 27x P/E will be sustained given a strong consumer spending environment, combined with Visa's ability to gain share against paper-based payments.

■ Regulation: Visa and other card networks face scrutiny from domestic and international regulators on merchant processing fees, including interchange and network fees. Any potential regulation of network or interchange fees could pressure card volume and revenue growth. ■ Macroeconomic Risk: Visa's payment volume and transaction growth is highly correlated with global consumer spending. An economic downturn could pressure payment volume and transaction growth, resulting in slower than estimated revenue gains. ■ Merchant Litigation: Ongoing merchant litigation of Visa and Mastercard card fees could result in compensatory damages and/or reduced interchange and network fees. ■ Disintermediation: Disruption from alternative payment methodologies such as account-to-account based payments or cryptocurrencies could pressure card payment volume growth and pricing, resulting in slower revenue and EPS gains.

A multinational technology company, Visa Inc. enables electronic payments through branded credit, debit & prepaid cards, as well as, account-to-account. Visa earns revenue primarily from fees charged to merchants for processing transactions through its global payments network. Visa is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.

Visa remains well-positioned to gain global market share from the multi-year runway to convert paper-based payments to card, enabling high-single payment volume growth over the next 3 years, at least. We believe the market is already pricing in slower growth based on our macro scenario analysis, and higher potential for regulatory risk.

■ Upcoming 2Q/FY25 earnings report with FY26 guide ■ Recovery of Asia Pacific economy could drive cross-border outperformance

■ Cross-border volume deceleration worsens or persists longer ■ USD strengthens, and currency becomes a larger headwind going forward ■ Global economic fundamentals deteriorate, dragging down purchase volumes ■ Regulation drives Visa's pricing down
