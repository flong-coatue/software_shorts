ETN reported 4Q results that had both good and bad characteristics. On the good side, the company is seeing extremely strong growth in its biggest businesses (EA organic growth +15%) and its data center business is surging (revenue +40%, orders +200%). This is a critical part of the story and the company appears be firing on all cylinders here. What is not so good is the profit contribution from this growth. This was the key call out in our downgrade from Buy to Neutral at the start of the year, and results today largely confirm our concerns. For example, the company dropped only a small % of sequential revenue growth to the bottom line (12% sequential incremental margins in EA) and margins in this important segment were down almost 200 basis points year over year. And it doesn't appear to be getting better, with implied 1Q incremental margin of just 10% (year over year). We think the 1Q outlook, in particular, will drive some weakness in shares today after the recent run up.

The bottom line is ETN's operational issues are clear and present in today's release and near term outlook. This supports our more neutral outlook on shares despite the strong growth. But we also believe these issues will get fixed, and ultimately the company will make the most of its impressive organic growth. But a bit more patience may be required. Maintain Neutral and conf. call is at 11am ET.

Eaton provides energy efficient solutions to assist customers in effectively managing electrical and mechanical power more reliably, safely, and sustainably. It operates in five business segments: Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, Aerospace, Vehicle, and eMobility.

Our price target is based on forward P/E. Risk Statement: The Electrical Equipment and Multi Industry sector faces a broad range of risks. It is cyclical in nature with exposure to the underlying cycles inherent in everything from aviation, auto, trucking and trains to construction and consumer electronics to mining, power, oil and gas and more depending on the specific stock. EEMI companies are subject to risks associated with unexpected changes in the underlying global macro environment, currency and interest rate movements, commodity price inflation as well as company-specific execution, M&A, integration, labor relations and changes in the competitive or regulatory environment. These changes can be in the form of product technology, e-commerce and other digital disruption and/or channel disintermediation. Capacity and related pricing pressures are also a risk through the cycle.
