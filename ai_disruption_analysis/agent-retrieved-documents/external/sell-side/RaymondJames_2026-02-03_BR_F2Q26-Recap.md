We maintain our Outperform rating on Broadridge but lower our target price to $257 following F2Q26 results. It was a strong quarter and the secular tailwinds that have driven Broadridge's long-term revenue and EPS growth are still very much intact, in our view. In fact, we're taking our forward EPS estimates up modestly after the print. We also think the bear case narrative that tokenization is going to disrupt Broadridge's business model is substantially overdone. Our lowered target price reflects a more conservative target multiple given the currently nonfalsifiable bear cases around tokenization and AI risk, but we believe the current risk/reward on Broadridge is highly attractive with its shares now trading at less than 20x our FY27 EPS estimate.

● Tokenization in the spotlight: Broadridge continues to believe the vast majority of tokenized equities will be purchased via broker-dealers and digital trading platforms, rather than directly via issuers, and will require intermediaries to facilitate the same asset servicing responsibilities that exist today. Additionally, the company sees potential for incremental position count growth as new entrants like digital asset brokers begin to offer tokenized equities. Within GTO, Broadridge believes on-chain clearing and settlement do not eliminate post-trade requirements and could increase complexity and costs if digital assets are processed on separate platforms. As a result, Broadridge positions its platform as a solution to increased complexity, allowing clients to process tokenized assets alongside traditional assets.

● Strength in Regulatory Communications franchise: Regulatory Communications revenue within ICS grew 18% y/y in F2Q26, up nicely from 4% in F1Q26. This acceleration was driven by a ~6% timing benefit as well as healthy underlying fundamentals. Specifically, equity revenue position count growth accelerated to 11%, and the company is speaking to a second-half outlook for high single-digit growth. Fund position growth accelerated to 15% in F2Q26 vs. just 2% in F1Q26, which was due to timing, while the company expects growth to trend in the mid-to-high single-digit range through the year.

● Strong event-driven results again: Broadridge posted ~$91 million of event-driven revenue during F2Q26, down 27% y/y against a notably tough comp. Despite the decline relative to the year-ago period, event activity remains well above the long-term quarterly average of ~$62 million, driven by healthy mutual fund proxy activity and higher levels of corporate actions, including what we believe is the M&A contest for Warner Bros. Looking ahead, Broadridge expects quarterly event-driven revenue to return closer to its typical long-term range. ● Estimates: Our FY26 non-GAAP EPS estimate moves higher to $9.56 while our out-year nonGAAP EPS estimates move higher as well, reflecting a slightly stronger ICS recurring revenue outlook and greater share repurchase capacity given the stock's recent share price decline.

Our $257 target price is based on a blended average DCF analysis and a P/E-derived fair value estimate. Our target P/E of 23x is slightly below Broadridge's long-term median forward P/E of 24x to reflect concerns about tokenization and AI that we expect will persist.

Target Price $257.00 ↓ old: $276.00

Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., headquartered in Lake Success, New York, is a service provider to banks, brokerdealers, mutual funds, and corporate issuers. The firm's Investor Communication Solutions (ICS) segment supports a broad range of investor communications, including proxy distribution and voting. The firm's Global Technology and Operations (GTO) segment provides technology and business operations solutions for global investment banks, wealth managers, broker-dealers, and investment managers.

Analyst Compensation : Research analysts and associates at Raymond James are compensated on a salary and bonus system. Several factors enter into the compensation determination for an analyst, including: i) research quality, ii) team productivity, iii) client feedback, iv) rating accuracy, v) overall revenue and profitability levels of the department and firm (a portion of which is generated by investment banking activities) and vi) compensation levels for comparable research analysts at competing firms. Registration of Non-U.S. Analysts : The analysts listed on the front of this report who are not employees of, or associated with, RJA are not registered/qualified as research analysts under FINRA rules and are not subject to FINRA Rule 2241 restrictions on communications with covered companies, trading securities held by a research analyst account, and obligations related to identifying and managing conflicts of interest.

This global disclosure considers all entities of Raymond James and its affiliates. The jurisdiction where the analyst(s) is registered will determine what is permitted. For example, if the persons responsible for the content of this report are not licensed as research analysts in accordance with applicable rules promulgated by the regulatory organization(s) where this report is distributed, any client wishing to effect trades in any security should contact their Raymond James representative. The analyst Patrick O'Shaughnessy, primarily responsible for the preparation of this research report, attests to the following: (1) that the views and opinions rendered in this research report reflect his or her personal views about the subject companies or issuers and (2) that no part of the research analyst's compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views in this research report.

We value financial technology companies using some combination of a discounted cash flow analysis, an EV/EBITDA-derived fair value estimate, and a P/E-derived fair value estimate, the latter of which is a function of our long-term earnings growth outlook and a target P/E-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio. We derive a company's PEG ratio and forward multiple taking into account peer evaluation and the company's historical valuation range. It also takes into account several company-specific factors, including the economic cycle, expected growth rates, and company-specific risk characteristics.

Following are some general risk factors that pertain to the businesses of the subject companies and the projected target prices and recommendations included on Raymond James research: (1) Industry fundamentals with respect to customer demand or product/service pricing could change and adversely impact expected revenues and earnings; (2) issues relating to major competitors or market shares or new product expectations could change investor attitude toward the sector or this stock; (3) Unforeseen developments with respect to the management, financial condition or accounting policies or practices could alter the prospective valuation.

Regulated pricing in proxy business: Fees that Broadridge can charge issuers for proxy and other investor communications distribution are regulated by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). While past revisions have generally been neutral for Broadridge's economics, Broadridge ultimately does not control pricing for regulated communications and therefore any renewed effort to change the pricing schedule could potentially harm the firm's economics. Client concentration: Broadridge derives a large portion of its consolidated revenues from a small number of clients. In recent years, a single client has accounted for a material percentage (>5%) of consolidated revenues. Any loss of business or demand from a large client could materially impact financial results.

ETF disruption: To date ETFs have not proven to be a meaningful headwind for Broadridge. In fact, they have likely been a net positive as ETF position count growth has likely outweighed any offsetting reduction in equity or mutual fund positions. That said, to the extent that investors increasingly utilize ETFs in lieu of multiple equity positions this could have negative position count and per piece pricing implications for Broadridge.

Moderate Risk/Provide Income (M/INC) Larger capitalization, lower volatility (beta) equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings, and dividend yields meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. Many securities in this category are structured with a focus on providing a consistent dividend or return of capital. Moderate Risk/Wealth Accumulation (M/ACC) Larger capitalization equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings growth, the potential for long-term price appreciation, and often a dividend yield. Moderately Aggressive Risk/ Provide Income (MA/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a dividend meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. These companies typically feature sound financials, positive earnings, and the potential for long-term price appreciation. Moderately Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (MA/ACC) Generally equities of companies in fast growing and competitive industries with less predictable earnings (or losses), potentially more

leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, and potential risk of principal. Aggressive Risk/Provide Income (A/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a meaningful dividend but may face less predictable earnings (or losses), more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, financial and competitive issues, higher price volatility (beta), and meaningful risk of loss of principal. Securities of companies in this category may have a more volatile income stream from dividends or distributions of capital. Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) Generally equities of companies with a short or unprofitable operating history, limited or less predictable revenues, high risk associated with success, high volatility (beta), potential significant financial or legal issues, and the meaningful risk of loss of principal.

RJL has developed a proprietary algorithm for risk rating individual securities. The algorithm utilizes data from multiple vendors, and all data is refreshed at least monthly. Accordingly, suitability ratings are updated monthly. The suitability rating shown on this report is current as of the report's published date. In the event that a suitability rating changes after the published date, the new rating will not be reflected until the analyst publishes a subsequent report.
