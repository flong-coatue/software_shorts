✓ Updating Estimates ✓ Management Call Takeaways

January 27, 2026

UPS - Margin Normalization Thesis To Be Delivered On Time We are updating estimates and raising our PT to $130 (from $120). UPS' 2026 guidance reflects a transition year, not steady-state performance. We expect U.S. Domestic margins to trough in 1H26 before exiting the year at healthier levels and on track to continue expanding in 2027 as the glide-down concludes, MD-11s retire and $3.0B of cost savings are realized. This is a follow up to our note published this morning. We are lowering our 2026 adj. EPS estimate to $7.16 (from $7.43 previously), while maintaining our 2027E of $8.27. We are also raising our PT to $130 (from $120), based on ~18x our 2026E adj. EPS (vs. UPS's historical peer group range of 16-24x).

We came away from this morning's call with increased confidence that 2026 will be a transition year for UPS, with reported 1H results obscured by front-loaded headwinds and a materially stronger run-rate emerging in 2H. While full year U.S. Domestic adj. EBIT margins are guided to be roughly flat YoY (7.7%), management repeatedly emphasized that this masks a sharply improving trajectory as the year progresses. 1H26 will absorb the remaining impacts from the Amazon.com, Inc (AMZN, Buy, Squali) glide down, the transition of Ground Save volumes to USPS, lagged fixed and semi-variable cost removal, and incremental aircraft lease expense tied to the MD-11 retirement. As a result, management guided to a MSD% U.S. Domestic EBIT margin in 1Q26. Our updated model accounts for this and for U.S. EBIT margin to ramp up to 8.7% and 10.4% in 3Q and 4Q, respectively.

Timing of 2026 Costs Impact Near-Term Margins: The timing of margin pressure was one of the most important clarifications from the call. We estimate ~$100mm of U.S. Domestic cost pressure in 2026 related to MD-11 replacement costs, with ~90% of that impact occurring in 1H26 as leased aircraft temporarily replace retired capacity. At the same time, AMZN volume reductions step down faster than fixed costs and semi variable costs can be removed, creating a near-term mismatch that weighs on margins early in the year. These pressures are expected to ease meaningfully in 2H26 as cost actions catch up, Ground Saver transition costs subside, and network begins operating at a more efficient scale.

With regard to AMZN, UPS will be removing ~1mm packages per day of AMZN volume, and completing the glide-down. At the same time, in order to align the network with these efforts, the company will also eliminate ~25mm labor hours, reduce operational headcount by ~30k positions through attrition and a voluntary driver separation program, and close at least 24 facilities in 1H26. These actions underpin UPS' effort to deliver another $3.0B in INCREMENTAL cost savings in 2026 (on top of the $3.5B achieved in 2025), reinforcing to us that margin expansion is being driven by structural cost removal rather than a cyclical demand recovery - as we noted in our recent Margin Normalization note (link here). On the pricing front, management reaffirmed confidence in revenue quality with RPP expected to grow ~MSD% in 2026 (we are modeling +4.6% YoY) and Base rate pricing remains healthy at +300bps - consistent with recent trends.

On the International front, continued near-term pressure due to tariff and de-minimis changes are likely to continue, with EBIT expected to be down YoY in 1Q (we are modeling 1Q International EBIT margin down ~400bps YoY). However, we believe these pressures will

ease as comps ease throughout the year, trade lanes stabilize and revenue quality takes hold, supporting improving margins in 2H26. Final Thoughts - Overall, the earnings call materially strengthens our thesis on margin normalization starting in the back half of 2026. While headline guidance points to flat full-year U.S. Domestic margins (and EPS), we remain confident that this is a timing issue rather than a structural one. With the glide-down nearly complete, significant cost savings still to be realized, and a leaner, more automated network, UPS is positioned to exit 2026 with meaningfully higher margins a clearer earnings power trajectory in 2027.

Atlanta, GA based United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) is one of the largest logistics, ground and air cargo shipping companies in the world. Under the UPS brand, the company commands a strong market share in >200 countries and leverages the use of its extensive fleet of airplanes and ground vehicles to deliver ~20.0mm daily packages (2025), for a total of 5.1 billion packages in 2025. In recent years, the company has been focused on growing through its 'Better, Not Bigger' strategy which includes UPS' three key pillars, (1) Customer First, (2) People Led, and (3) Innovation Driven.

We have a Buy rating on UPS shares. In our view, the company stands to benefit from growing its higher margin SMB and Healthcare business, as well as from cost containment / efficiency measures that we anticipate will support margin strength. At the same time, while the increased glide down of its largest customer over the next 18 months is likely to pressure topline results, we believe this is already priced into the stock. With shares currently trading at ~13.4x our 2025 adj. EPS estimate, we believe risk/reward is compelling.

We derive our $130 price target based on 18x our 2026 adj. EPS estimate. In our view, UPS' shares warrant a multiple at least inline with the company's historical trading range of 16-28x P/E vs. the current trading range of ~13x our 2026E adj. EPS given the prospects for the company to expand margins over the coming 12-18 months as it focuses on growing its higher margin SMB and Healthcare businesses.

Domestics and International Macro-Economic Dependency UPS operates in a global environment where it has exposure to >220 countries and ~99% of the world's GPD. Economic recessions in virtually any country in the world could negatively impact UPS' ability to generate revenue and operate efficiently. Supply Chain Risk Any hiccups to the global supply chain could lead to a significant impact to UPS' ability to operate efficiently. Environment Regulations & Government Regulations The company's operations are highly dependent on the use of its aircraft and ground vehicles. A change in governmental regulations around vehicle emissions could have a potential negative impact on UPS' ability to operate. Jet and Vehicle Fuel Costs Fuel costs represented 4.8% of the company's operating expenses in 2024 (~$4.4B). Increases in the price of crude oil could lead to elevated jet and vehicle fuel costs for the company which would consequently lead to operating margin risk for UPS.

Labor Union Requirements A portion of the company's labor base is under a collective union labor agreement called International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). Any changes in the requirements, and or strikes, from the union could lead to operational challenges, as well as increased labor costs for the company. Labor Availability While the company has many autonomous capabilities, 2024 ended with a labor base of ~500k employees (both full and part time employees). UPS' ability to source and maintain quality labor is imperative around its operations. Climate/Weather Challenges Any climate related issues around the world could impact the company's ability to move goods, thus causing delays in its operations and potential increased costs. Global Geopolitics With a network operation in >220 countries, any geopolitical instability around the globe could impact UPS' ability to operate in certain countries/regions which has the potential to disrupt operations and generate revenue loss. Cybersecurity Risk/IT Risk Connecting the company's entire network is UPS' IT. Any potential hacks to the company's systems could lead to operation challenges and increased financial/litigation costs.

M&A Risk UPS has historically engaged in M&A activity. If the company were not able to properly implement its acquisitions into the company, including its efforts to merge currently owned operating segments, it could lead to financial loss for the company. Inflation Risk Elevated inflation has the potential to impact consumer demand for goods and services, which could consequently impact macro conditions and the need for UPS' services. Air Network Operations Failure to properly adjust its air network could result in operational weakness and financial loss. Failure to Successfully Implement Cost Savings Plans UPS has engaged in cost savings efforts. Failure to properly implement these could result in operational, reputational and financial headwinds for the company.
