| INFY.BO   | 12m Pri c e Target: Rs1,720.00   | Pri c e: Rs1,599.05   | Upside: 7.6%   |

Having said that, demand recovery is not broad based. While Infosys was upbeat on discretionary spends in BFSI and EURS verticals, the company mentioned that demand remains soft in other verticals (though not deteriorating). Our FY26/FY27 constant Fx revenue growth estimates move higher by 20-30 bps, and we forecast 5.5% YoY revenue growth for Infosys in FY27, vs 3.3% in FY26E. We note that the mid-point of Infosys' 3% to 3.5% revised FY26 revenue growth guidance implies 5% YoY constant Fx revenue growth for the company in the Mar '26 quarter.

Infosys' EBIT margins were in line with GSe, with EBIT growth in 3Q of 8% YoY, which we expect to improve to 10% YoY in FY27. Our EPS estimates move higher by 1-2% for FY27/FY28 (though we cut reported EPS in FY26 due to the labour code impact), with our 12m target price moving to Rs1,720 (was Rs1,700), and the ADR revised to US$19.1 (from US$18.9). Infosys stock trades at 21x FY27E P/E, largely in line with its 10Y average, and at a 14% discount to its 5Y average. We remain Neutral rated on the stock.

Post the three large-cap India IT results, we see a higher probability of FY27 revenue growth for the sector being better than that in FY26. However, the extent of recovery still remains unclear; we are forecasting 5.5% revenue growth for the sector in FY27 (vs +1% in FY26). We believe for IT stocks to see any meaningful re-rating from current valuations, the market will await greater visibility on the

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 sector returning to high-single-digit revenue growth (similar to pre-COVID levels), which we believe may be some time away. Revenue guidance implies strong FY26 exit: Infosys has revised its FY26 revenue n growth guidance higher to 3% to 3.5% (vs. 2% to 3% earlier), and this was 50 bps ahead of our expectations; the guidance excludes any yet to complete M&A. The company attributed this to strong deal wins, strength in the BFSI and EURS (energy, utilities, resources and services) verticals and improving demand trends in 3Q. The lower end of Infosys' guidance implies -1.4% qoq revenue growth in 4QFY26, while the upper end implies +0.5% qoq.

In line 3QFY26; strong deal wins: While Infosys' 3QFY26 revenue growth of +0.6% n qoq (constant Fx) decelerated vs +2.2% qoq in 2Q (adverse 2H seasonality), the company's commentary suggests stable to improving demand trends in 3Q. Deal wins were strong at US$4.9 bn, or +7% YoY on a rolling 4-quarter basis; 3Q revenues were partly aided by a US$1.6 bn NHS deal that Infosys won recently. Infosys is seeing strong momentum in fi nancial services and energy, utilities, resources and services verticals and the company expects growth to accelerate in these segments in FY27 vs FY26; we estimate 4.7% YoY revenue growth for Infosys in its FS vertical in FY26, and 3.5% in the EURS vertical (constant Fx). Other verticals such as retail, manufacturing and Hi-tech are still seeing tepid demand trends. Within regions, growth was led by Europe, with muted

trends in North America (largely due to seasonality).

Margins stable; net income impacted due to one-time cost from labour code: n Infosys' 3QFY26 EBIT margin of 21.2% improved 20 bps qoq, driven by tailwinds from currency movement (+40 bps) and operating e ffi ciencies (+50 bps), which were partly o ff set by 70 bps impact from furloughs and lower working days. Infosys mentioned that the impact of higher variable pay in the quarter was o ff set by a one-o ff bene fi t (sale of PPE). Infosys did not specify a wage hike timeline (the last hike happened in Jan/Apr '25). The company has retained its full-year FY26 EBIT margin guidance of 20-22%; we estimate 20.9% margin, implying 8% YoY EBIT growth in FY26. Headcount increased 2% qoq in 3QFY26, which the company attributed to con fi dence in the demand outlook. Infosys recognised a one-time impact of Rs13 bn from implementation of the labour code,

or Rs9.7 bn at the net income level; reported net income was -2% YoY in 3Q, but excl. the impact, net income increased 12% YoY. AI: Per Infosys, AI productivity related pass-through is largely o ff set via new n consolidation deals (where Infosys has been a bene fi ciary), which has led to an increase in its market share.

On the back of Infosys' 3QFY26 results, our FY26E-FY28E revenue/EBIT estimates are higher by 1-2%. Our FY26 reported net income is lowered by 2% due to the impact from the labour code, and higher by 1-2% in FY27 and FY28. Accordingly, our revised target price for Infosys is Rs1,720/ADR at US$19.1 (was Rs1,700/US$18.9). We remain Neutral rated. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Infosys is India's second largest IT Services company with c.US$19 bn in revenues as of FY25, which we expect to grow 3.3% YoY in constant Fx terms in FY26E, improving to 5.5% YoY in FY27. While we expect Infosys to be a bene fi ciary of vendor consolidation in an uncertain macro environment, we continue to see reduced growth visibility, particularly on discretionary spends. We forecast 8% YoY EBIT growth in FY26E ( fl at on a YoY basis). On a 12m forward P/E, Infosys is trading at a discount to its last 5-year historical average; however Infosys' premium vs. sector is largely in line vs. history. We see a balanced risk-reward and are Neutral rated on INFY.BO/INFY.

We are Neutral rated on Infosys. Our 12-month target prices for INFY.BO/INFY, of Rs1,720/US$19.1 are based on a target P/E of 21x (in line with the last 5-year average less 1 SD) applied to our Q5E-Q8E EPS estimate of Rs82.12. We use USD/INR of 89.88 to calculate the INFY ADR 12m TP of US$19.1. Key upside risks : (i) faster-than-expected improvement in the US/global macro; (ii) a recovery in discretionary IT spend; and (iii) faster-than-expected margin expansion. Key downside risks : (i) slower-than-expected recovery in discretionary IT spending; (ii) negative impact from technology changes; (iii) pressure on margins. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.
