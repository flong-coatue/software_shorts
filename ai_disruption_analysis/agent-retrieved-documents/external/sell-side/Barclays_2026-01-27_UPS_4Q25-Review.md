Where we stand: Following our initial take on 4Q results and full-year 2026 guidance earlier today (see "4Q25, Initial Thoughts"), UPS management offered further clarity on the outlook with several discrete headwinds early in the year expected to make for a particularly sharp earnings ramp in the back half. As previously communicated, the Amazon volume "glide down" is expected to accelerate in early 2026, and while management continues to take action to address the cost structure, semi-variable and fixed costs will come out on a lag (particularly another planned voluntary separation program), resulting in some temporary cost challenges to start the year. In addition, while the renewed last mile delivery contract with the USPS is expected to eventually improve the economics of the Ground Saver product, the shift is expected to come with sizable transition costs early in 2026. Further, management's decision to accelerate retirement of the MD11 fleet will result in incremental lease expense until replacement B767 aircraft can be delivered. The result is a mid-single digit Domestic margin

expectation for the first quarter, likely a bit below our prior 6.5% forecast (we now model 5.5%). Near-term headwinds are also expected in International, where continued effects from the elimination of the de minimis exemption worldwide are expected to drive operating earnings down 30% YoY on flat revenue in the first quarter. We cut our 1Q EPS forecast over 15% as a result (to $1.20) while also acknowledging the company's solid progress managing operating expenses in the face of steep Amazon volume declines. We maintain our full-year domestic margin forecast on higher top-line expectations, keeping our full year EPS estimate unchanged even when factoring in more challenged international profitability. Nonetheless, our model shakes out to an EPS decline of 6%, below guidance for flat, as we suspect the second leg of cost takeout could prove a bit more challenging than the first, resulting in slightly lower domestic margins for the full year (vs. guidance flat).

4Q beats. UPS reported 4Q25 adj. EPS of $2.38, ahead of our $2.04 and consensus $2.21 estimates. US Domestic revenue beat our model by over 3% (supported by strong yields) with segment margins nearly 170bps ahead, driving a core EBIT beat of $395mm (35c). Below the line, a higher share count more than offset lower net interest cost to explain the remaining 1c variance to our model. Adjusting estimates. After accounting for 4Q results and management guidance, we take our 1Q26 EPS estimate to $1.20, keeping 2026 at $6.70.

Why UNDERWEIGHT? Risks from growth in lower-quality parcel verticals, acceleration in high-cost air operations and Amazon as the largest customer outweigh upside potential from yield and efficiency initiatives. Upside case UPS's upside case is estimated assuming a stronger economy drives a 3% increase in package volumes, relative to our current estimates. Under this scenario, we assume market multiples would remain consistent with mid-cycle levels. Downside case UPS's downside case is estimated assuming a weaker economy drives a 3% decrease in package volumes, relative to our current estimates. Under this scenario we assume market multiples compress to near trough levels. Upside/Downside scenarios Note: FY End Dec Source: Company data, Bloomberg, Barclays Research

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe"). In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence

as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
