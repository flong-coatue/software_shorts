Upgrade to OW with $76 PT; recent stock price weakness presents an opportunity to own arguably the best fintech asset in our coverage BNPL as a category will continue to gain share within broader e-commerce and we expect Affirm will a key driver of that share gain Affirm is a proven executor with an impressive management team and differentiated product offering in merchant-funded 0% APR promotions Unit economics likely to improve as funding costs on new originations roll w/ lower rates, while yields on the existing fixed-rate loan book remain elevated FIS & Fiserv partnerships could potentially exceed the current Affirm Card runrate and are not contemplated in forward estimates

Capitalizing on recent weakness to own arguably the best fintech asset in our coverage. We have long been looking for an opportunity to own what we deem to be one of the highest quality fintech assets in our coverage and believe the time is now. The stock has sold off by >20% over the last month (vs. payments / consumer finance peers down by a median of ~8%) on concerns that: 1) third-party data has slowed, with Affirm potentially only narrowly beating consensus vs. historical beat magnitude of 3-4pts; and 2) the consumer is weakening.

· On third-party data slowing , our own tracking of web traffic and app usage ( Exhibit 7 ) indicates that historical beat magnitude of low- to mid-singledigits vs. consensus of +31% y/y is still in play, lending credence to Affirm management commentary that a particular third-party data vendor has "tracking error" in the quarter. · On credit , we think it's important to remind investors that we aren't yet seeing consumer credit weakness amongst Affirm's borrowers (see credit performance data in Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9 ) and pending credit performance could be buoyed by higher tax refunds, with the Wall Street Morgan Stanley & Co.

Expect unit economics to improve as funding costs on new originations roll down with lower rates, while yields on the existing fixed-rate loan book remain elevated, expanding spread as liabilities reprice faster than assets... Affirm's balance sheet is structurally liability sensitive, which should represent a tailwind to revenue less transaction costs (RLTC) in a declining rate environment, as the loans it originates are priced at fixed interest rates, so as rates fall, funding costs reprice lower over time while yields on the existing fixed-rate loan book tend to remain sticker, supporting RLTC expansion. Affirm's historical sensitivity framework implies that a 100 bp decline in rates can lift RL TC as a % of GMV by 25-40 bp over the ensuing 12-18 months. With the Fed cutting by 25bps in F1Q26 and two 25bps cuts in F2Q26, 75bps of cuts would be worth 30bps of run-rate uplift to RLTC as a % of GMV, although average realization across the cuts is

~40% (because each cut starts flowing September / October / December 2026 with full benefit realized in March / April / June 2027), implying a ~12bps tailwind to RLTC as a % of GMV or ~$77mm of incremental RLTC dollars vs. consensus which is modeling RLTC margin compression of ~7bps. ( Exhibit 5 ).

...with an ILC license a potential incremental provider of cheaper funding capital that would also support better incremental margins. In late January, Affirm submitted an application to the Nevada Financial Institutions Division and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to establish Affirm Bank, a proposed Nevadachartered industrial loan company. While we don't have any knowledge of near-term approval, the granting of an ILC license could: 1) reduce the costs Affirm pays to partner banks (FedACH fee schedule shows $0.0035 for ACH vs. 5bps of transaction volume plus $0.22 per transaction for regulated debit); 2) increase deposits and reduce funding costs for future revolving credit products; and 3) increase flexibility in new product launches without dependence on third-party banks.

BNPL is a structural share gainer within e-commerce and Affirm is differentiated from a capability perspective with its merchant-funded 0% APR product. Since the beginning of the December, near-term growth deceleration concerns seem to have been extrapolated to the potential for a medium-term slowdown in the business. Our October 2025 deep-dive Insight report on Buy Now Pay Later (Buy Now Pay Later: Share Gainer with Growing Implications Across E-Commerce, Consumer Finance, Macro, and ABS (23 Oct 2025)) reinforced our conviction that BNPL share gains will continue, with BNPL penetration in the U.S. potentially expansion toward the low-double-digits by 2030 when assuming growth rates of Census Bureau e-commerce persist in the high-single-digit range ( Exhibit 2 ). Beyond some of the drivers that will support broader BNPL share gains (e.g., expanded credit availability, broadening distribution, etc.), we believe Affirm's ability to drive merchant-funded

0% APR promotions and attract and retain spend from high income / high FICO consumers is a key differentiating factor that will support its M incremental share gains, as our September 2025 Consumer Pulse Survey found 86% of BNPL users rated 0% APR promotions as 'very important' or 'critical' to their usage decisions ( Exhibit 3 ). We estimate merchant-funded 0% APR promotions represent a $8bn+ transaction margin dollar opportunity ( Exhibit 4 ), with Affirm's 0% APR GMV growing at >1.5x the rate of total GMV C3QTD.

adoption. We believe the recent announcements about partnerships with Fiserv and FIS have the potential to drive the most meaningful step-function change in Affirm's business over the next 12-24 months. Simplistically, if Affirm were to win a large regional banking customer of FIS and / or Fiserv, the volume and cardholder uplift could exceed the current Affirm Card run-rate (2.8mm cardholders in F1Q26 with quarterly GMV of $1.4bn+). Illustratively, when we back out estimated PULSE (owned by Discover / Capital One) volume from Nilson's domestic debit purchase volume of ~$1.1tn, ~50bps of penetration on the residual would imply ~$4bn of volume and could represent a MSD / HSD uplift vs. FY27 consensus GMV ( Exhibit 6 ).

Leaving estimates unchanged but trimming PT to $76. We are leaving our estimates unchanged as we are already ahead of consensus, most notably on profitability ( Exhibit 10 ). We are trimming our price target to $76 (vs. $83 prior) as we now apply a 23x (vs. 25x prior) multiple to our unchanged Base Case CY27 SBCand warrant-burdened EPS estimate of $3.32, as peer multiples have compressed by a median of ~8% since we established our prior Affirm price target in early November. Note that our

$76 price target implies a ~0.4x growth-adjusted P/E multiple (vs. peer median of ~0.7x; Exhibit 1 ). We believe risk-reward is attractive at current levels as near-term GMV deceleration concerns seem overblown and bearish investors are likely to assign a AXP-like high-teens multiple to CY27 EPS of $3+, implying fairly limited downside, all else equal. Our 23x target multiple for AFRM is a premium to peers given our outlook for faster relative revenue and profitability growth.

28x CY27 SBC- and warrant-burdened EPS of $4.84 Robust revenue growth as Apple Pay, Af fi rm Card, and 0% ramp. In addition to continued traction with merchants, attach rates of Affirm Card prove to be higher than expected, creating a multi-billion-dollar product over the medium-run. Meanwhile, Affirm is able to leverage 0% promos and its relationship with Apple to drive frequency and unlock access to high-income consumers. Macro and interest-rate environment remain favorable for a longer period, warranting a higher multiple

23x CY27 SBC- and warrant-burdened EPS of $3.32 Af fi rm continues to gain share with large partners like Amazon and Shopify, driving more consumer engagement and repeat usage via Af fi rm Card. Affirm is able to continue to grow GMV (and net revenue) well in excess of 25% through FY27 while material operating leverage and normalization in SBC & warrants translates to an even faster pace of profitability growth. Multiple reflects AFRM's premium growth profile, which we believe is appropriate so long as credit continues to outperform.

We are OW on AFRM as have built more confident that the business can maintain robust growth while maintaining delinquencies, improving margins, and attracting and retaining spend from higher income and higher FICO consumers.

18x CY27 SBC- and warrant-burdened EPS of $1.49 Questions on sustainability of model arise as capital market access becomes limited and funding costs rise, while higher consumer delinquencies also pressure margin. Macro softness translates to less favorable access to markets, thereby pressuring asset yields and RLTC margin. Adoption of Affirm Card is lighter than expectations while GMV slows given a lack of incremental partnerships and intensifying competition. M

Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold and sell. Investors should carefully read the definitions of all M ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone. In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice. An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations.

Overweight (O). The stock's total return is expected to exceed the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Equal-weight (E). The stock's total return is expected to be in line with the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Not-Rated (NR). Currently the analyst does not have adequate conviction about the stock's total return relative to the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Underweight (U). The stock's total return is expected to be below the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months.

Unless otherwise specified, the time frame for price targets included in Morgan Stanley Research is 12 to 18 months.

Attractive (A): The analyst expects the performance of his or her industry coverage universe over the next 12-18 months to be attractive vs. the relevant broad market benchmark, as indicated below. In-Line (I): The analyst expects the performance of his or her industry coverage universe over the next 12-18 months to be in line with the relevant broad market benchmark, as indicated below. Cautious (C): The analyst views the performance of his or her industry coverage universe over the next 12-18 months with caution vs. the relevant broad market benchmark, as indicated below. Benchmarks for each region are as follows: North America - S&P 500; Latin America - relevant MSCI country index or MSCI Latin America Index; Europe - MSCI Europe; Japan - TOPIX; Asia relevant MSCI country index or MSCI sub-regional index or MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex Japan Index.
