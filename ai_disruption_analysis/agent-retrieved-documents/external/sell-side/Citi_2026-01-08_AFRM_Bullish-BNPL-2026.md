BNPL has evolved from a discretionary checkout feature into an increasingly embedded payment and budgeting tool across both online and offline commerce. As adoption broadens, the BNPL industry is benefitting from greater scale, deeper data sets, and improved funding efficiency, which together are driving more predictable credit outcomes. While investor focus remains anchored on loss rates and consumer health, recent performance suggests credit behavior is tracking within expectations with sustainable economics. Importantly, the maturation of the category is shifting the debate away from viability and toward execution, distribution and profitability. As BNPL continues to integrate into card rails, digital wallets, and merchant ecosystems, we believe the category is positioned for material share gains driving 20%+ volume growth in 2026 and beyond, with valuation upside likely to be driven by continued execution and improving investor confidence in the business model. Reiterating Buy/HR ratings on AFRM and KLAR, and Buy on XYZ. BNPL Credit Has Been Durable – And the Data is Getting Better.

Credit quality has been a gating mechanism for BNPL investors, but the evidence increasingly supports a contained, measurable risk profile rather than a subprime narrative. From a macro perspective, consumer behavior has not shown signs of BNPL unraveling. PYMNTS notes that BNPL usage held roughly flat at ~14% of consumers through the late summer of 2025 (from Apr-25) even as credit card usage accelerated (+46% over the same period). We believe this implies that BNPL is not being stress-loaded even as credit usage increases. PYMNTS additionally finds Pay Later adoption is not confined to financial stress as higher income consumers (earning $100K+) are materially more likely to use installments and BNPL as compared to lower income cohorts, which is consistent with BNPL functioning as a cash-flow and budgeting tool across income and not just as a last resort credit option.

1. BNPL as a Budgeting Tool – True, but not a Red Flag . We believe the use of BNPL as a budgeting tool is not necessarily bearish for credit. We view a more relevant question to be whether the product is producing greater loss volatility as it becomes more mainstream. PYMNTS data suggests Pay Later usage is broadening into routine spend categories (not just big-ticket discretionary) and that higher earners are active – which supports our view that BNPL is increasingly becoming a payment preference rather than being a signal on stress. 2. “Lack of Credit Reporting” is Being Actively Fixed Across the Industry. We believe this concern is being structurally addressed and is a key reason we are constructive on go forward credit outcomes. AFRM has expanded reporting with Experian to include all pay-over-time products for loans originated from 4/1/25 onward, improving transparency and reducing the risk of unreported debt stacking over time.

FICO is also introducing new scoring models, FICO Score 10 BNPL and FICO Score 10 T BNPL, that are designed to incorporate BNPL data into its traditional scoring for lenders to make more informed decisions. Even if lender adoption of these frameworks happens gradually, we think directionality is paramount: more BNPL data in mainstream credit decisioning should reduce stacking, improve risk segmentation and reward providers that run tighter credit. Over time, we believe measures similar to this can lower loss volatility. 3. BNPL’s Convenience Reflects it Short Duration Nature Rather than Masking Credit Behavior, and Real-Time Controls Make it Manageable. BNPL’s advantage is what makes it safer than revolving credit in many cases: shorter duration, faster data feedback loops, and tighter underwriting controls. KLAR’s management explicitly notes that higher provisioning in periods of growth does not mean rising inability to repay, but instead points toward improving delinquency as the portfolio scales.

KLAR’s 60+ days past due (or delinquency rate) of its Pay Later product declined from 1.3% in 1Q22 to 0.9% in 1Q25. The delinquency rate of its U.S. Pay Later product declined from 2.1% in 1Q22 to 1.1% in 1Q25. The delinquency rate of its Fair Financing product declined from 3.2% in 1Q22 to ~2.0% in 1Q25. The delinquency rate of its U.S. Fair Financing product declined from 4.6% in 1Q22 to ~2.6% in 1Q25. KLAR has also emphasized its realized losses over the past five quarters have been low and relatively stable (0.45% of GMV in 3Q24, 0.39% in 4Q25, 0.48% in 1Q25, 0.45% in 2Q25, and 0.44% in 3Q25).

In addition, over the past five quarters AFRM’s realized losses (NCOs as a % of GMV) have generally declined (2.02% in F1Q25, 1.79% in F2Q25, 2.05% in F3Q25, 1.72% in F4Q25, and 1.68% in F1Q26). AFRM’s 30, 60, and 90 day plus installment delinquency rates were 2.8%, 1.6% and 0.7% in F1Q26, which compares similarly to 2.8%, 1.7%, and 0.8% in F1Q25, respectively. AFRM and KLAR’s recent credit performance points toward stability among the two established pure BNPL players, rather than deterioration. Industry-Level Performance Has Not Eroded, In Aggregate – and Metrics Have Improved.

The CFPB’s December 2025 BNPL market share report, while based on data as of 2023, showed encouraging general BNPL credit performance trends. Charge-offs (% of GMV) declined to 0.92% (from 1.71% in 2022), and Loan Charge-Off Rates (number of charged-off loans as a portion of all originated loans during each year) declined to 1.83% in 2023 (from 2.63% in 2022). 4. Recent Rate Cuts Should Aid Consumer Health . As pressure eases on variable-rate consumer debt, near-term liquidity should improve and support repayment rates on short-duration BNPL plans. Combined with lower funding costs and tighter underwriting control, rate cuts should reduce loss volatility and support healthier BNPL credit outcomes.

Overall, we find that increased preferential adoption of BNPL (rather than a reliance as a last resort credit line), improving industry standardization, recent industry and company-specific BNPL credit performance, and rate cuts are all structurally supportive of the BNPL industry’s go-forward credit outlook. BNPL loans are shorter-duration and smaller in principal than traditional forms of consumer credit (U.S. average credit card balance of $7,321 in 1Q25; average personal loan balance of $11,724 [source: LendingTree]). This compares to KLAR’s average consumer balance and duration of $88 and 40 days and AFRM’s ~$660 and ~150 days. As such, BNPL lenders are able to employ a near real-time underwriting structure with the data it collects, allowing more informed decision making compared to traditional consumer credit. A Different Way to Look at Losses - Realized Losses as a % of Average BNPL Receivables.

While KLAR reports its realized losses as a percentage of its GMV (0.44% in 3Q25), we believe an interesting way to analyze realized losses of BNPL lenders is as a percent of capital at risk over the quarter’s period. The calculation is analogous to the net charge-off ratio utilized for analyzing traditional lenders, only we address the quick turnover on these BNPL portfolios by measuring losses as a percentage of capital at risk during a period. Though this calculation leads to a higher loss percentage (smaller denominator), we explicitly note this as simply another way to look at BNPL losses. This calculation is not directly comparable to a traditional lenders’ net charge-off ratio as the capital used for these originations are often being lent multiple times during a given quarter, but again, provides another perspective.

We believe this to be an interesting measure of capital at risk over a period of time. Using this framework, KLAR’s realized losses (% of average consumer receivables) in CY3Q25 were ~5.70%, and modestly below AFRM’s at 7.0% (NCOs as a % of average loans HFI). Notably, these estimates are likely to be conservative (high) as the denominator (average BNPL receivables) may omit balances in unrestricted cash allocated to BNPL loans at each quarter-end measured. Even in this more conservative, alternative credit framework exercise, our analysis shows that BNPL loss rates fare far better than many risky credit profiles. In addition, among AFRM and KLAR’s longer duration loan

segments, AFRM’s US Installment Loan (ex. Pay in X) 60+ day delinquency rate was 1.6% in F1Q26, and KLAR’s U.S. Fair Financing 60+ day delinquency rate was ~2.6% in 3Q25, which are much better than U.S. subprime consumer-level 60+ day delinquencies of 13.6% in 2Q25 (source: TransUnion). BNPL Has Become a Mainstay Payment Option in Commerce.

BNPL has transformed from what was once a novelty payment option to an embedded piece of the modern commerce system. Even as post-COVID growth rates normalize across the industry, we believe there are multiple structural drivers, including consumer preference for payment flexibility and merchant conversion economics (higher AOV and conversion rates), as well as newer drivers including wallet-oriented distribution and expanding payment rails (card networks and issuer led installments), that should support sustained adoption across eCommerce and, increasingly, across in-store channels. Recent credit developments are also pushing the category toward standardization, which may ultimately expand addressable use cases by improving underwriting, reducing fraud, and making BNPL more appealing to lenders and policymakers Market Adoption is the Gauge of BNPL’s True Long-Term Durability. Though public discourse often focuses on delinquencies (and other credit dynamics) and fee practices, the most apparent trend indicative of the BNPL’s industry establishment is that purchase volume and consumer count.

According to an Oct-25 Study on BNPL Market Growth by Precedence Research, global BNPL volume is expected to grow 13.7% Y/Y to $560.1B in 2025. The report additionally forecasts BNPL purchase volume to grow at a 10.7% CAGR from 2025-2030 to $911.8B. Precedence Research estimates BNPL revenues to grow at a 15.2% CAGR from 2025-2034. U.S. BNPL users are expected to grow to 91.5 million in 2025, or +6% Y/Y. We Believe BNPL’s Growth Outlook Will be Stronger Than Industry Estimates Currently Expect. According to research from Mordor Intelligence, the global retail sales market is projected to be $27.26T in 2025, and is expected to grow at a 6.25% CAGR from 2025-2030 to $36.91T. Another study conducted by EMARKETER estimates the size of the global retail ecommerce industry at $6.419T in 2025, and forecasts growth at a 7.1% three-year CAGR to $7.886T in 2028.

Using these industry forecasts, we estimate BNPL’s penetration (as a % of global retail sales) in 2025 at 2.05% and trending upward to 2.47% by 2030. However, according to the same study conducted by Mordor, BNPL market share in 2024 disaggregated by online vs. point-of-sale (POS) sales indicates the market was 72.1% online and 27.9% POS.

Point-of-Sale BNPL solutions continue to be perfected across many of the largest BNPL lenders (i.e. AFRM, KLAR, and XYZ) with omnichannel card, digital wallet, and mobile application solutions. We believe the growth prospects from these omnichannel solutions to be a meaningful vector going forward to drive both overall and POS BNPL growth. At KLAR, Klarna Card GMV has accelerated from 51% Y/Y growth in 2Q25 to 92% Y/Y growth in 3Q25 and is substantially higher than the overall company’s GMV growth (+24.8% Y/Y and +29.1% Y/Y, respectively). At AFRM, Affirm Card GMV growth of +132% Y/Y in F4Q25 and +135% Y/Y in F1Q26 has been above the overall company (at +43.0% and +41.6% Y/Y growth). At XYZ, post-purchase BNPL origination volume through the cash app card reached a $3B annualized run-rate in early Oct-25 (from $2B in Jul-25).

Running an analysis in which BNPL eCommerce volumes grow at ~7.1% (in-line with global eCommerce growth expectations) and BNPL POS volumes grow (at what we find to be a highly conservative ~20% estimate), implied overall BNPL growth would reach the industry’s ~10.7% BNPL growth CAGR estimates. However, we believe BNPL’s growth rate will likely trend above the 10.7% CAGR going forward due to the growing preference of BNPL as a payment option, in general, and given the increasing ability to consumers to utilize BNPL as a payment option in-store as well. Running an analysis in which BNPL eCommerce volumes grow at ~15% (below GMV growth expectations of the larger players we cover) and BNPL POS volumes grow (at what we find to be a conservative ~32% estimate), implied overall BNPL growth would trend closer to a 20% Y/Y rate. These dynamics are important because they imply the increasing habitual nature of BNPL. In other words, BNPL’s growth is coming not only from new users, but also from repeat and expanding behavior.

Rather than simply viewing the MDR associated with its 0% APR Installment product (higher at ~7%) as an elevated transaction cost imposed on the merchant, AFRM must convince, or “educate”, merchants that the MDR should be considered within the framework of a marketing or sale cost. Said in other words, merchants need to be convinced that offering the 0% APR Installment product (and hence offering a relative price discount due to the 0% APR Installment MDR vs. other prevailing MDRs) will lead to increased order volume and profit like a marketing initiative or product sale might. A fundamental strength of BNPL, in general, is increased average order volume (AOV) and increased purchase conversion rates. According to research by Novuna Consumer Finance, shoppers spend up to 166% more when offered financing options, and research from Qliro cited merchants that include BNPL offerings in their checkout see conversion improvements in the range of 4% to 30%+.

In addition, AFRM’s own 0% APR Installment product performance seemingly verifies its added value to the merchant as the product’s GMV grew +74% Y/Y in F1Q26, +93% Y/Y in F4Q25, +44% Y/Y in F3Q25, and +70% Y/Y in F2Q25. KLAR also offers 0% APR products, and refers to these transactions as Pay Later. This product accounts for the large majority of its GMV and is predominantly focused on shorter term (average duration of approximately 38 days) and smaller ticket size transactions (average balance per active Klarna consumer of approximately $88). The Pay Later product is most directly comparable to AFRM’s short-term 0% APR product (known as Pay in X; 15% of GMV in F1Q26). The main distinguishing characteristic of AFRM’s O% APR Installment product relative to KLAR is the duration of the portfolio: the duration of loan comprised within AFRM’s 0% APR Installment portfolio range 3 to 12+ months.

Card products are a Key Future Growth Driver for KLAR, AFRM and XYZ’s BNPL. AFRM, KLAR and XYZ have been positioning their respective card products as pillars of their future growth strategies. Both AFRM and KLAR first found success providing BNPL services online through e-commerce and digital checkout experiences. We believe the companies are excited about BNPL in the offline (brick-and-mortar) realm as its relative infancy as an in-store payment solution (vs. online) presents an opportunity to attract a broader customer base and greater wallet share. We also favor both the Affirm and Klarna card as Direct-to-Consumer efforts. Traditionally, Affirm and Klarna have developed relationships with merchants or PSPs in order to offer its products to the end consumers. However, these cards (Affirm Card, Klarna Card, and Cash App Card) allow consumers to make BNPL purchases virtually anywhere (where Visa is accepted) without having any prior relationship with said merchant.

AFRM views the Affirm Card as a main driver to increase consumer engagement and transaction frequency, and noted on 12/16/25 that the card is currently the fastest-growing and one of the most profitable parts of its business. Affirm has laid out an internal target of reaching 10 million active cardholders, each with $7,500 in annual spend, and indicated it is approximately one-third of the way of reaching this goal after launching the card in in early 2021. As of FY1Q26, AFRM had 2.8 million active Affirm Card consumers (+101% Y/Y), a 12% Card attach rate, GMV of $1,427M (+145% Y/Y; 13% of total FY1Q26 GMV), and Affirm Card transactions accounted for 11% of total transactions. This compares to active Affirm Card consumers of ~1.5 million in FY1Q25, and GMV of $607M (8% of total FY1Q25 GMV).

KLAR is leveraging the Klarna Card to transition “from payments” to offering a full suite of banking features alongside financing. KLAR aspires to be the default payment method for its active and future consumers, and the Klarna card expands its consumers ability to utilize all Klarna payment features both in-store and online. KLAR’s recent growth in the Klarna card to 3.2 million active card users globally as of 3Q25 was primarily due to the full rollout of the Card product in the United States on 7/4/2025 where users rose to 1.4 million from “virtually zero” and facilitated KLAR’s expansion strategy in the U.S. Klarna Card GMV resultingly grew by 92% Y/Y in 3Q25, from 51% Y/Y in 2Q25.

XYZ already strategically integrated Afterpay’s BNPL capabilities directly into the Cash App Card as one of its primary focuses is to unify its overall ecosystem. XYZ’s initiatives encompass (1) a “post-purchase” (retroactive) option that has demonstrated significant traction, alongside (2) its newer “pre-purchase” functionality that enables the Cash App Card to be a financing tool at the point of purchase. As of 3Q25, XYZ had 26 million Cash App Card actives and its post-purchase BNPL originations through the Cash App card exceeded $3B in annualized volume during 3Q25. We view post-purchase BNPL integration into the Cash App card as a key differentiator for XYZ that enhances its existing offering by providing credit capabilities on a

well-accepted card platform (also on the Visa network). We also expect XYZ’s pre-purchase BNPL functionality into the Cash App card to help drive further BNPL growth by bringing XYZ’s expansive base of Cash App Card actives financing capabilities at the point of sale. Differing Funding Model Leads to Different Structural Advantages. KLAR funds approximately 91% of lending with consumer deposits ($14B as of 9/30/25), of which 72% are fixed term with an average duration of 319 days. This compares to the average duration of its loan portfolio of 40 days, and this duration gap acts as a natural protection to inflation. KLAR has a structural advantage relative to AFRM in that it has access to a $10T European retail deposit network, with its on-B/S cost of funding at 2.4% as of 9/30 (vs. xIBOR at 2.7%).

In addition, KLAR has been making progress towards diversifying its funding sources, and has opened up to the capital markets as it looks to expand its origination capacity. This year, KLAR has tapped senior unsecured bonds, launched a forward flow agreement on its U.S. Pay Later loans enabling up to $26B in origination capacity of the life of the deal, a $1B facility from funds invested by Elliot Investment Management under which it anticipates to facilitate up to $6.5B in U.S. Fair Financing loans over a two-year deal, and another warehouse facility with funding capacity of up to $1.6B. While these funding vehicles are likely higher costs, we view these announcements as confidence from investors in the sufficient underlying performance of its various BNPL products and an avenue to more flexibly execute on its market share gain prospects and, resultingly, GMV and revenue growth.

AFRM operates a diversified funding stack that encompasses warehouse facilities, programmatic ABS (static and revolving master trust), and forward-flow programs. Roughly 15% of AFRM’s funding is floating (warehouse), most of the book reprices over three to four quarters and the company has estimated a 100 bp rate move would translate to a ~40 bps RLTC impact.

AFRM’s key differentiators (relative to KLAR) are (1) the barrier to entry associated with its successful 0% APR Installment product, (2) a stronger current profitability profile (more heavily interest income oriented), and (3) more established secondary market businesses (GOS and servicing income). KLAR’s unique features (relative to AFRM) are (1) a structurally lower-cost funding base, with 91% of originations funded by consumer deposits at a 2.4% cost, (2) greater scale and geographic reach ($118.6B in LTM GMV across 26 countries vs. AFRM’s $39.8B across three) and (3) a higher-frequency, lower-ticker, shorter-duration transaction mix. Acting as a tailwind to both business models is a deepening presence of BNPL as a payment option through the development of relationships with key PSPs and key merchants, and improving DTC and offline efforts with the meaningful success of both the Affirm and Klarna cards.

AFRM currently trades at 20.0x and 15.7x our CY26 and CY27 EV/EBITDA, and 11.8x and 9.9x our CY26 and CY27 EV/Gross Profit. Over the LTM, AFRM has traded up 39.1%. KLAR currently trades at 18.7x and 14.1x our CY26 and CY27 EV/EBITDA, and 6.2x and 5.1x our CY26 and CY27 EV/Gross Profit. Since its IPO, KLAR shares have declined 23.2%. We believe KLAR shares deserve a discount on EV/CY26E GP due to its strong, but comparatively lower transaction margins, profitability and growth expectations. However, we believe both AFRM and KLAR’s durable models will support strong and improving growth rates over the mid-term, supportive of multiple expansion. We are Buy/HR on AFRM with a $100 TP and Buy/HR on KLAR with a $45 TP. Figure 6. AFRM Revenue Mix (Quarter Ended 9/30/25)

AFRM brings momentum centered on sustained GMV growth, continued scaling of the Affirm Card and its 0% APR Installment product, and stable credit performance. Recent BNPL holiday volume strength should act as a tailwind to growth. Investor focus should remain on top-line growth, RLTC (%) durability, funding cost developments, and expectations for improved GAAP and non-GAAP operating profitability. As such, we model AFRM’s F2Q26 GMV growing by 30% Y/Y (vs. 28%-31% guidance), revenue +21% Y/Y (vs. 19%-22% guidance), RLTC to 24% Y/Y (vs. 22%-25 guidance), RLTC (%) down 20 bps Y/Y to 3.93%, and its non-GAAP operating margin at 27.55% (vs. 28%-30% guidance).

Source: Citi Research, Company Reports, Visible Alpha Affirm Holdings, Inc. Company description Affirm Holdings (AFRM) was founded in 2012 and is one of the leading Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) companies in the world today. Affirm aims to redefine payments and commerce through its technology forward, simple, consumer and merchant friendly and transparent product offerings that famously do not charge late fees for missed payments. Affirm’s robust risk management framework utilizes complex machine learning algorithms and is constantly improving, ultimately aiming to drive both commerce growth and financial control for consumers. Investment strategy We have a Buy / High Risk rating on AFRM. We view Affirm as a leading and pure play BNPL service provider with a greater concentration of U.S. exposure relative to its peer Klarna. We believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from both the maturation of the BNPL industry and given very strong secular growth tailwinds. We view AFMR’s current valuation as attractive due to both its profitability and growth prospects, but also note price performance will likely remain tied to the macro and consumer strength/weakness. Valuation

We value AFRM based on EV to Gross Profit and consider our FY27 estimate. Our target price of $100 implies 11.8x FY27 gross profit estimates representing a premium for its very strong growth outlook and improving profitability profile. Risks AFRM is rated High Risk for sensitivity surrounding its consumer credit exposure and sentiment, macroeconomic volatility, and reliance on external funding. Risks to our target price include: Broader economic weakness and more specific consumer weakness, interest rate risk, earnings volatility, and regulatory risk. Block Inc Company description XYZ is a financial technology company focused on building an ecosystem dedicated to economic empowerment for people around the world. The company’s products for sellers and consumers are designed to work together. Square is the name of the company’s acquiring business that supports merchants, while Cash App houses a variety of consumer facing offerings like a digital wallet, BNPL capability, and spend tools like Cash App Card, and more. Investment strategy

We have a Buy rating on XYZ. We view XYZ as a unique service provider for SMBs and consumers with a primarily U.S. based footprint, but whose international presence is steadily spreading. We believe that the company’s Adj. Gross profit KPI can experience acceleration near term, driven by GPV acceleration from the Square segment (better distribution) and higher monetization from the Cash App segment (more Borrow and BNPL volumes). Valuation We value XYZ on an EV/EBITDA basis on our 2027 estimates. Our target price of $105 implies a 17.5x multiple, a significant premium to the company's LTM 2 year forward EV to EBITDA multiple of ~11x. We think such a premium is warranted given the company's 1) accelerating Gross Profit growth and 2) expanding Adj. EBIT margins. Risks This stock is High Risk based upon our quantitative model but assigning a High Risk rating is not supported by other qualitative factors such as the company’s notable exposure to recurring software revenues, and so a High Risk rating has not been applied.

Risks to the target price include: Reduction in SMB new business formation. Deterioration of general consumer credit quality. Increased competition from other digital wallet fintechs. Klarna Group Plc Company description

Klarna was founded in 2005 with an intention to pioneer a new approach to how consumers transact by providing a safer online payment alternative now known today as “Buy Now, Pay Later” and to address the weaknesses in commerce today including inefficiency, trust, fraud, the consumer-merchant relationship and onerous interest-related fees for both consumers and merchants. The company began providing short-term, flexible and predominantly interest-free, transaction financing in Sweden. From its roots, Klarna began expanding its product set with additional payment methods, the Klarna App, Klarna card, and other digital financial services, and achieved balanced growth scaling operations in Europe for the first 14 years of the business. Klarna has since expanded to the U.S. and other key strategic markets in an effort to drive growth, scale, and greater profitability potential. As of the end of FY2Q25, Klarna operates in 26 countries and serves 111 million active Klarna customers across approximately 790 thousand merchants. Investment strategy

We have a Buy/High Risk rating on KLAR. We view Klarna as one of a few dominant players within the quickly growing BNPL space and believe it is well positioned for continued growth, market share wins and wallet share gains in what will likely be a market composed of a few winners a decade from now. We expect KLAR’s profitability metrics to take a turn towards continued improvement as the average duration on its Fair Financing business normalizes (heavily weighted on the front end due to accelerated growth) and

as scale allows for greater profitability in Klarna’s newer markets. To the extent Klarna chooses to invest more heavily than we expect on expansion, its path toward peer profitability may prove longer, but with the benefit of greater market share. We believe the BNPL industry remains in its early stages of adoption at roughly 1% of the total payments ecosystem, and we see potential for BNPL, and Klarna’s consumer-friendly and flexible payments capabilities in general, to become more mainstream over time, as it has in its most mature markets. Klarna’s price performance will likely remain tied to the macroeconomy and consumer strength/weakness due to the company’s inherent credit exposure. But, we believe, the lower-duration, lower AOV nature of its product set and consistently proving the strength of its underwriting capabilities should loosen the shares’ tie to these higher beta factors over time. Valuation

Our $45 target price is based on 9.3x EV/FY26E GP and 7.7x EV/FY27E GP, which represents a slight discount to its closest publicly traded peer, Affirm Holdings, Inc. Risks We rate KLAR High Risk based on Citi’s quantitative model, which screens the stock as High Risk given the recent IPO (limited trading history): We note the following risks that could prevent the shares from achieving our target price: • Credit Risk: Klarna’s financing model leaves it susceptible to consumer credit risk. Weakness or errors in underwriting to mitigate idiosyncratic risk, systemic weakness across market(s) or unexpected events can result in elevated transaction costs for Klarna through provisions for credit losses. A recession, or depression, could significantly impair both Klarna’s growth and credit performance.

• Key PSP/Merchant Concentration Risk: Should any PSP or Key merchant become a growing source of Klarna’s transaction and volume, losing that partner would represent a meaningful headwind to Klarna’s overall growth and earnings outlook. • Earnings Volatility: Our estimates for KLAR’s growth, revenue, and other key financial statement drivers may change more frequently. Our valuation framework may change over time as the BNPL industry grows and Klarna’s trajectory evolves. • Regulatory Risks: The global regulatory environment for financial services companies is robust and ever-evolving. Increased regulatory oversight applied to Klarna could pose a potential risk to the company’s financial performance. If any of these risk factors has a greater downside impact than we anticipate, the share price may not achieve our price target. PayPal Holdings Inc Company description

PYPL is a digital payments platform provider, possessing a two-sided network comprised of both consumer and merchant accounts. On the consumer side, PYPL offers its namesake digital wallet, the Venmo P2P app, and a variety of ancillary services like BNPL, card issuance (linked to PayPal or Venmo account, credit and debit) and rewards from consumer spend. On the merchant side, PYPL’s flagship product is the PayPal Checkout Button (“Branded Checkout”) as well as unbranded payment processing solutions like Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments (“PPCP”), and value-added services like enhanced security modules or FX settlement tools. Investment strategy

We have a Neutral rating on PYPL. We view PYPL as a competitive online payment processor that is in the process of: 1) driving accelerated Branded TPV growth, 2) pricing to value contracts related to its Braintree asset, and 3) rolling out new use cases for both the PayPal and Venmo digital wallets with the goal of raising overall monetization. While we believe that these objectives are priorities for the business, we think that we still need to see more evidence of incremental progress before moving off the sidelines. Valuation We value PYPL on a P/E multiple off our 2027 estimates. We reduce our target price to $60 (from $78), which implies a 9.8x multiple (from 11.8x) due to PYPL's need to increase near-term investments to support long-term growth. Risks Risks to our target price include: Reduced consumer discretionary spend. TPV growth in Branded checkout. Loss of major merchant contract. Pricing war in key markets.

Compensation is not linked to specific transactions or recommendations. Like all Firm employees, analysts receive compensation that is impacted by overall Firm profitability which includes investment banking, sales and trading, and principal trading revenues. One factor in equity research analyst compensation is arranging corporate access events between institutional clients and the management teams of covered companies. Typically, company management is more likely to participate when the analyst has a positive view of the company.

For financial instruments recommended in the Product in which the Firm is not a market maker, the Firm is a liquidity provider in such financial instruments (and any underlying instruments) and may act as principal in connection with transactions in such instruments. The Firm is a regular issuer of traded financial instruments linked to securities that may have been recommended in the Product. The Firm regularly trades in the securities of the issuer(s) discussed in the Product. The Firm may engage in securities transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Product and, with respect to securities covered by the Product, will buy or sell from customers on a principal basis. Unless stated otherwise neither the Research Analyst nor any member of their team has viewed the material operations of the Companies for which an investment view has been provided within the past 12 months.

Data current as of 01 Jan 2026 Buy Hold Sell Buy Hold Sell Citi Research Global Fundamental Coverage (Neutral=Hold) 60% 32% 8% 37% 47% 16% % of companies in each rating category that are investment banking clients 36% 40% 28% 40% 34% 35% Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings: Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned. Investment Ratings:

Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign “Rating Suspended” status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—“ and “-“ respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned “Under Review” status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
