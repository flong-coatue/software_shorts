Costco Wholesale operates a store footprint of over 875 warehouses globally. We look very favorably upon COST's L-T prospects. A few key factors underpin our views: 1) unique and improving consumer value proposition; 2) open-ended worldwide growth prospects; 3) leading competitive position poised to continue to drive share gains; 4) consistent track record of shareholder returns; 5) strong management team; and 6) potential for sustainable top-and bottom-line delivery even against a more competitive retail backdrop.

We recommend Outperform-rated Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) as a top pick within our Consumer Growth & eCommerce coverage. DKS represents the last remaining operator of large format sporting goods superstores, across the US, and increasingly one of the better-managed omni-channel operators within specialty retail. Our positive outlook for DKS and the company's shares is predicated upon the following key factors: 1) continued, solid underlying consumer demand within sporting goods and athleisure; 2) much improved alignment with notable brands, such as Nike (NKE), and others; 3) a now well-developed tech and online backbone that allows DKS to connect much better with core consumers; 4) potential for aggressive repositioning at the recent acquired Foot Locker to represent another sales and profit driver for DKS; and 5) still discounted share valuation.

CMG is trading at levels not seen since early 2023, which reflects weak SSS and a challenging margin setup. Management is pulling several levers to reaccelerate the business, despite ongoing macro challenges (e.g. 3-4 LTO's). Our menu-pricing study suggests CMG's price/value appeal remains best-inclass, which could be better communicated and represents a strong driver for future market share gains. Any offsets to mid-single-digit inflationary pressures (menu-price increases or cost savings) could be a margin catalyst, particularly if sales improve. At ~27x P/E, valuation sits at trough levels, which we believe represents an intriguing level for longer-term investors.

Business Development Companies Commercial & Investment Banking, Merchant Banking, Private Equity

Mitchel Penn, CFA

OBDC is a business development company (BDC) investing in senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, equity-related securities of middle market businesses. We believe Blue Owl Capital can generate a 9.5% return on equity, and with a cost of equity capital of 9%, we estimate a fair value of $16.

OWL is an alternative asset manager that provides investors access to capital solutions through its Direct Lending and GP Capital Solutions, brought together by the combination of two prior firms Owl Rock and Dyal, respectively. We view OWL as one of the premier alternative asset management platforms integrating multiple experienced management teams with proven track records overseeing investment strategies well posed against the current backdrop.

We believe Mastercard remains well-positioned to gain global market share from the multi-year runway to convert paper-based payments to card, enabling low double-digit payment volume growth over the next three years, at least. Additionally, given its exposure to less mature payments markets, we estimate for the next two years at least, Mastercard should outgrow Visa on revenue growth.

Lodging, Leisure, and Residential Real Estate

Tyler Batory

Pursuit is a collection of travel experiences that includes recreational attractions, hotels and lodges, food and beverage, retail, sightseeing, and ground transportation services. We think PRSU is well positioned for growth in FY25 and beyond. The company should benefit from the continued growth in margin in FY25, the resumption of international visitation to Canada longer term, and the recovery following the Jasper wildfires. PRSU also has substantial financial flexibility and potential growth from M&A and ROI projects.

Hagerty (HGTY - O), $15 Price Target Hagerty provides auto insurance and other services for classic car enthusiasts. Our bullish stance reflects: multiple revenue sources, each of which has high growth potential; less competition given niche customer base that values HGTY's product offerings; industry-leading underwriting margins, pricing less subject to P&C cycle, well received when personal auto industry margins are under pressure. Recent increase to float from secondary means more visibility.

| Biotechnology   | Jay Olson, CFA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Biotechnology   | Jeff Jones Alumis (ALMS - O), $50 Price Target ALMS is driven by the value of the company's TYK2 targeting portfolio, including both peripherally acting ESK-001 and the CNS penetrant A-005. Targeting of TYK2 has been validated in clinical studies for both PsO and SLE, as well as by genetic studies beyond these indications. We view envudeucitinib as having demonstrated potentially best-in-class TYK2 inhibitory capabilities based on clinical results in PsO to date. |
| Biotechnology   | Matthew Biegler Tyra Biosciences (TYRA - O), $36 Price Target Tyra Biosciences is a biotechnology company developing targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and rare diseases, with a focus on overcoming acquired drug resistance. We believe Tyra's lead FGFR3 inhibitor could become a potential best-in-class therapy for FGFR3-mutant urothelial carcinoma and achondroplasia, by improving selectivity and mitigating on-target resistance mutations.                 |

Palvella Therapeutics is a late-clinical-stage company developing topical treatments for rare diseases of high unmet need. We see $1B+ sales potential across initial Qtorin indication, and believe that demonstrated Phase 2 data, and clear mechanistic rationale, have derisked Qtorin in its current clinical development. We see a clear path to commercial success, as the competitive landscape includes oral cancer therapies, which will likely have serious adverse effects, and other, weaker, topical therapies which are far behind in clinical development. We believe Qtorin topical gel is positioned to be the therapeutic of choice for patients suffering with cutaneous vascular malformations. Additional Qtorin indications behind lead assets support pipeline-in-a-product potential.

Gossamer Bio (GOSS - O), $12 Price Target Gossamer Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing inhaled seralutinib for the treatment of PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) and PH-ILD (pulmonary hypertension with interstitial lung disease). We see seralutinib's unique safety and efficacy profile emerging as a preferred choice among severe patients who are not adequately served by currently available therapies. Gossamer has astutely positioned seralutinib to also tap into large, underserved geographies and markets such as Japan with the ongoing Ph3 PROSERA study and planned Ph3 in PH-ILD expected in mid-'25 with global co-development partner Chiesi. We see shares trading at an attractive entry point ahead of potentially transformative catalysts.

Axsome Therapeutics is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. We view AXSM as an attractively positioned mid-cap biopharma company based on: 1) accelerating revenue growth with three approved products led by Auvelity for MDD; 2) broad pipeline including label expansion opportunities plus late-stage development assets; 3) several upcoming catalysts that could unlock additional value; 4) strong balance sheet enabling strategic optionality; and 5) demonstrated management execution with long-term track record.

Wave Life Sciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing RNA medicines to transform human health. We view WVE as a leading innovator in RNA medicine, enabled by the proprietary PRISM platform, which allows multi-modal development of potentially best-in-class oligonucleotides for RNA editing, gene silencing, and RNA splicing applications. We are optimistic about WVE's four clinical programs with emerging differentiated profiles, especially WVE-006 for AATD and WVE-007 for obesity, that could unlock significant opportunities. Finally, WVE is advancing multiple early-stage, innovative programs for cardiometabolic diseases.

LEGN's flagship product, Carvykti, is a BCMA-directed autologous CAR-T cell therapy developed in partnership with JNJ, for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The promising launch of Carvykti has positioned Legend as a leading player in cell therapy, and although competition in the space is increasing, we expect LEGN can maintain a competitive share in MM given its first-mover advantage, commercialization by JNJ, potentially best-in-disease efficacy, and unique CRS profile easing outpatient dosing.

CRNX appears well-positioned to meaningfully improve the treatment condition for chronic endocrine disorders. Daily oral Palsonify represents a transformative solution for acromegaly, and, together with a second, larger opportunity in carcinoid syndrome for which a pivotal trial has begun, we project ~$2B in peak paltusotine sales. Atumelnant is entering broad pivotal development in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)-which may show competitive advantages to marketed options-as well as in Cushing's syndrome. CRNX's first candidate from its nonpeptide drug conjugate platform is in Phase 1/2 evaluation in targeted solid tumors, and three other internally-generated candidates should soon enter the clinic. We see considerable upside on commercial and pipeline progress.

Addus provides home and community services, including personal care, hospice, and home health. The company operates in the attractive home care market and should benefit from the industry's strong growth and fragmented landscape. We believe the management team has streamlined its operations and is now able to make highly accretive acquisitions that will also diversify its geographic footprint. As a result, we have an Outperform rating on the shares.

iRhythm manufactures and markets patch monitors for ECG monitoring. Large players have made acquisitions, which will likely force structural changes in the competitive landscape. In our view, the 'looser' regulatory environment with the new administration should spur more M&A activity in MedTech land. However, we contend that there are very few good, high-growth public assets remaining that provide obvious complementarity to larger strategics. IRTC, in our view, is one of the most compelling assets in SMID-cap MedTech land.

| Industrial & Business Services          | Scott Schneeberger, CFA QXO (QXO - O), $30 Price Target In QXO, Brad Jacobs and team envision employing their historically proven playbook to drive organic growth, acquisitive growth, and margin expansion within the building products distribution industry, which is sizable, highly fragmented, relatively nascent in the use of technology, and where industry leaders are positioned to benefit from a demand backdrop across residential, non-residential, and infrastructure end-markets. QXO's initial acquisition of Beacon Roofing Supply provides it a strong cornerstone asset within a relatively resilient distribution category from which to leverage future growth. We anticipate that QXO organically doubles Beacon's adjusted EBITDA in the coming five years, with incremental adjusted EBITDA growth (and margin expansion) stemming from incremental acquisitions.   |

| Power, Physical AI & Advanced Materials | Colin Rusch Enphase Energy (ENPH - O), $67 Price Target Enphase Energy designs, develops, and sells micro inverter systems for the solar PV industry. We believe ENPH is the clear leader in microinverters and continues to grow with core markets while expanding its addressable market segments. We expect ENPH's energy storage solution continuing to gain share in 2025 as the company begins to sell on three continents with its upgraded product offerings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| HVAC, Power & Industrial Efficiency     | Noah Kaye Modine Manufacturing (MOD - O), $185 Price Target Modine Manufacturing provides thermal management products and solutions. We believe Modine's core competencies in thermal management and product innovation, coupled with a clear focus on value creation under the company's 80/20 framework, should drive accretive growth over and beyond our investment horizon. We see multiple catalysts to support positive estimate revisions and further multiple re-rating, including (1) data center expansion/diversification; (2) PT portfolio exits; and (3) Climate Solutions M&A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

TRMB markets and sells hardware and produces software into an integrated package that gathers and analyzes data enabling more productive deployment of assets. Despite the myriad crosswinds facing TRMB's diverse end-markets, we believe the company has positioned itself to benefit from the secular digitization in the key verticals of construction, agriculture, and transportation. We believe Trimble will benefit from both share gains, and continued migration to higher margin recurring revenue, and software and services, as it increasingly offers its customers integrated workflow solutions.

ESAB is a leading provider of welding equipment and consumables, gas control equipment, robotics, and digital solutions used in a wide range of global end-markets, including general industry, infrastructure, renewable energy, medical and life sciences, transportation, construction and energy. ESAB benefits from notable emerging markets leverage, needle-moving opportunities for North American mix enhancement, and the steadily improving scale and profitability of its gas equipment platform. While by no means immune to macro risk, we believe ESAB's continued portfolio evolution and self-help levers outweigh short-cycle demand concerns.

Nordson is a leading provider of equipment, components, and services across a wide variety of end-markets. Core technologies include precision material dispensing, testing & inspection, and surface coating and curing, and fluid dispense. Our Outperform reflects a view of positioning for durable, stable organic growth compounding, with sturdy positioning across end-markets, cyclical headwinds largely abated, portfolio tuning underappreciated, and increasingly focused cost structure.

KBR provides technology, engineering, and logistics support solutions to governments and companies around the world. The company operates through two segments: Sustainable Technology Solutions (STS) and Mission Technology Solutions (MTS). We believe our price target can be reached as comps ease, investors gain clarity on Lake Charles LNG or its replacements (e.g., Plaquemines '3.0', the front-end engineering and design (FEED) contract for the Abadi Onshore LNG project in Indonesia, and other contract extensions such as the one recently signed with Basra Oil Company), the spin-off approaches, and the company continues to deploy its robust FCF toward buybacks (~$450M remaining), dividends (currently $0.66/share annually) and strategic bolt-on M&A (particularly in MTS).

Analytics, Data, Security and Infrastructure Software

MongoDB offers a general-purpose, document-oriented NoSQL database designed to ingest large volumes and varieties of real-time data. Our bullish view is predicated on our belief that MongoDB: (1) can take advantage of secular themes emphasizing the importance of databases; (2) will gain share in a large and growing dynamic database TAM, supported by the relational database market; (3) will continue to execute on its land-and-expand model by adding new self-serve customers and converting self-serve to direct customers as their usage increases; and (4) can continue to innovate and position itself as a hybrid, cloud-agnostic option.

Roblox Corporation is a digital and social interactive experience platform. We believe the company's value proposition to users is compelling, and that Roblox will continue to effectively engage and retain users at massive scale and at a faster pace than video game industry growth. Roblox has a better solution to user growth and user retention than most game publishers. The company has strong potential to continue to outperform peers on long-term revenue growth and margin expansion based on technology innovation (more AI tools for creators) and business model innovation (better monetization).

Microsoft is the largest software provider in the world and a market leader in multiple business lines including office productivity, commercial and consumer cloud services, software applications and personal computing and gaming.

Wix is a leading, cloud-based, do-it-yourself web-development platform. Wix solutions are targeted at consumers, small business, and web development agencies. With the continued launch of new products, the company has evolved into a small to medium-sized business (SMB) cloud/ SaaS platform. Wix uses its "freemium" model where users can design, launch, and update a web page at no cost to bring on registered users. Once satisfied, users then pay to have the site go live using their own URL and to remove ad products. Wix is now targeting professional agencies with added premium live support for its platform.

Marvell is a fabless semiconductor company designing chips for data infrastructure. MRVL is a key enabler of AI. MRVL pivoted from consumer/storage towards high-growth AI, cloud, and 5G markets after several acquisitions (CAVM, Avera, Inphi, and Innovium). In DC/cloud, MRVL has a portfolio of solutions for custom compute ASIC, networking, electro-optical, HDD/SSD controllers, switching and security. The company boasts one of the industry's most comprehensive diverse networking solutions of DSP, TIA, Drivers and software for CSPs. We view MRVL as a well-managed, emerging growth/GM story.

Qnity is: 1) the only player in the semiconductor space that captures the entire semiconductor value chain by connecting front-end advanced-node chemistries with back-end advanced packaging down to system-level materials; 2) the largest pure-play semiconductor consumables company with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with ~2.5x leverage; 3) we believe well-positioned in AI growth areas such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging.

Storage & Infrastructure Software

DigitalOcean is a pure-play public cloud (IaaS/PaaS) provider focused on developers and SMBs (small to medium-sized businesses). This is a large and growing market, which we measure as a $120B-plus opportunity by 2030E. We believe the company is well positioned for secular trends in public cloud and has substantial international growth and AI expansion opportunities.

TeraWulf is a unique, vertically integrated owner and operator of nextgeneration digital infrastructure. It builds and operates datacenters optimized for bitcoin mining, but is transitioning and repurposing its assets to focus on high-performance compute (HPC) for AI and cloud workloads. It operates in unique geographic locations with access to 1.2GW of electric inventory powered predominantly by low-cost renewable sources. The company's strategic pivot reduces its exposure to unpredictability surrounding bitcoin mining and enhances its profitability in the AI-driven compute sector.

Maplebear, Inc. (CART - O), $65 Price Target Instacart operates a third-party (3P) marketplace platform that connects merchants, primarily grocers, consumers, and shoppers. It offers a full-service enterprise solution. We believe Instacart can further leverage its current position as a top-2 player in grocery delivery, and the company has considerably improved its order unit economics since 2019 (pre-pandemic). Furthermore, we believe that Instacart's high-margin advertising business will continue to grow.

DraftKings is a digital sports entertainment and gaming company created to fuel the competitive spirit of sports fans with products that range across daily fantasy, regulated gaming, and digital media. We believe competencies in product development and customer acquisition that DKNG utilized to become the daily fantasy sports (DFS) market leader will allow the company to be a critical player in accelerating the shift in US sports betting from ~$150B wagered illegally/offshore to licensed domestic operators. We estimate the US legal OSB/iGaming markets growing ~25%/24% annually from 2023, reaching ~$15.8B and ~$8.5B by 2025, as more states regulate digital wagering, and expect DKNG to achieve ~30-35% market share.

Rocket is one of the largest mortgage lenders in the US. Rocket represents the best way to invest in residential real estate, in our view, as refinance demand should benefit as rates come down. In addition, the company has created a very strong top of funnel and competitive moat in acquiring Redfin and Mr. Cooper that should drive revenue synergies and share gains over the long term.
