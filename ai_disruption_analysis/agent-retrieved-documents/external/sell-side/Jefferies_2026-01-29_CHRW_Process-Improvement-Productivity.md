Despite AGP coming in below estimates on lower ocean rate and higher TL spot rate headwinds, CHRW posted another strong quarter with 4Q EPS 8% above as the company continues to execute on its lean principles and cut costs with total avg. headcount down 13% YoY and 4% QoQ. With expectations well anchored for 20% EPS growth for years to come and a valuation level above that of essentially all the Mag7 stocks, we see shares as fully valued from a PV perspective. 4Q25 Results Beat as Further Headcount Cuts Offset a Soft AGP: Highlighted in Figure 1, adj. EPS was ~8% above our estimate as adj. operating profit was a 6% beat aided by below-the line tailwinds. Importantly, while underlying AGP was a modest miss with NAST AGP margin below expectations, operating costs came in below. Most notably, 4Q personnel costs were 8% lower YoY as companywide average headcount was 13% lower YoY and 4% lower sequentially.

2026 Expectations Well Anchored on Further (Though Moderating) Cost Reductions: With the 4Q results closing out another solid year for CHRW, expectations remain well anchored for further growth in 2026 with adj. operating profit expected to grow 15% - 25% to $965mm - $1.04bn. While this adj. OP range is unchanged, we did get an update on the explicit operating cost assumptions with adj. personnel expense expected to be between $1.25bn - $1.35bn (vs. our initial estimate of $1.33bn and $1.34bn in 2025) and adj. SG&A between $540mm - $590mm (vs. our initial estimate of ~$570mm and ~$555mm in 2025). This update on costs comes as company-wide AGP has decelerated for several quarters from +2% in the 1Q to +0.8% in the 2Q and -4% YoY in the 3Q and 4Q. We also highlight that AGP per business day decelerated through the 4Q with

AGP/day down -5% in October, +6% in November, and -12% in December as Ocean AGP within GF was pressured by lower ocean rates and NAST faced some headwinds from higher spot rates. Looking specifically at the 1Q, while the AGP headwinds are expected to broadly persist, it was further noted that personnel costs are expected to increase sequentially by $15mm as a result of the employer portion of FICA taxes resetting to a higher level until the employee wage limits are met later in the year, after which point the quarterly FICA taxes and personnel expenses are expected to decline.

Margin vs. Market Share Optionality and Valuation Thoughts: One comment from the conference call that caught our attention was the emphasis on its optionality between margin expansion and reinvestment into market share, stating that once mid-cycle margin targets are achieved, excess profitability could be redirected towards winning incremental volume growth. While nothing todate gives us reason for concern, sacrificing margin for volume gains has historically been a point of contention for investors. As a final note, with 4Q results wrapping up 2025 (and starting 2026 strong), we are watching valuation as CHRW's forward P/E now exceeds that of the AI hyperscalers.

We view the recent performance out of CHRW as nothing short of impressive. In the midst of macro uncertainties and a prolonged freight recession, CHRW continues to prove out the merits of its lean operating model, effectively utilizing tech and AI to improve productivity and outgrow the market. This being said, we maintain our Hold rating with the view that increasingly elevated expectations and robust multiple expansion has left shares appearing fully valued. Moreover, while we view the asset-light nature of the business as attractive, we note that in addition to its US truckload exposure, the company is exposed to ocean & airfreight rates through its Global Forwarding segment, which we think will be challenged near-term.

· 2026 AGP is +4% YoY and 2027 AGP accelerates to +7%. · 2026 operating costs of toward the midpoint of the updated range, with personnel costs of ~ $1.30bn and SG&A of ~$565mm. · 2026 operating income of $965mm is at the low end of the updated range and assumes zero market growth. · 2026 EPS increases 20% YoY to $6.10 with 2027 EPS up another 20% to $7.30. · Our $190 PT is based on 26x our base-case 2027 EPS estimate, toward the high end of the asset-light peer group.

Top Material Issues: 1) GHG Emissions. CHRW is unique among asset-owning transport companies in that it leverages a global network of logistics solutions without an owned fleet. It's focused on issues related to this business model to reduce Scope 3 emissions - that is, the indirect emissions associated with the logistics CHRW arrange for its customers. 2) Ecological Impact. As one of the largest produce providers, CHRW specializes in sourcing and transporting produce. The company is committed to advancing sustainable solutions to protect farmers, local communities, and farmland. Company Targets: After reaching its goal to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 40% by 2025 ahead of schedule, the company plans to further build on its ESG aspirations. Qs to Mgmt: 1) Regarding indirect emissions, what areas of over-the-road transportation do you see as having the most direct control over? 2) At Robinson Fresh, what aspects of produce procurement, packaging, and transportation are most critical to reduce food waste? 2024 Transportation & Logistics Sector ESG Integration

Downside Scenario,

· 2026 AGP is up MSD% YoY with 2026 up HSD%. · 2026 operating costs come in at the low end of updated guidance, with 2027 costs up just 2.5% vs. the HSD% AGP increase. · 2026 EPS comes in at $6.50, with 2027 EPS of $8.00. · Our $240 PT is based on 30x our upside 2027 EPS, above CHRW's long-term average in the high-teens.

· 2026 AGP performance is hindered by challenges in GF and a soft truck market · Personnel costs come in toward the higher end in 2025 with further increases in 2026. · Limited share buyback activity as the company prioritized de-leverage in a weaker freight backdrop. · 2026 EPS of $5.80 with 2027 EPS of $6.50. · Our $130 PT is based on 20x our bear-case 2027 EPS estimate, in line with the 15x-25x range.

· Freight rates (truckload, ocean, air) find a bottom and inflect to positive growth after months of decline. · The freight brokerage and 3PL industry continues to expand its penetration of the overall transportation & logistics market. · Profit margins expand in a downturn as variable costs are flexed down. · A potential sale or spin-off of its Global Forwarding asset. · Accretive M&A that could further diversify CHRW's service offerings. Equity Research January 29, 2026

· NAST (63% of 4Q AGP and 76% of adj. operating income) gross revenue increased 0.3% YoY to $2.81bn, below our estimate of $2.89bn (+3% YoY) as total volumes grew 1% YoY with TL volumes up 3% and LTL volumes up 0.5%. With the slight gross revenue increase, segment adjusted gross profit ("AGP") increased 1.9% as gross margin expanded 20bps YoY to 14.6%, though gross margin deteriorated 40bps sequentially and came in below our estimate of 14.8% and the consensus 14.9% as brokerage margin faced headwinds exiting the quarter as spot rates rose. Importantly, despite this pressure, adj. operating income increased 11.6% YoY to $134mm (37.6% margin) as NAST headcount was reduced -7% YoY. · The 2% AGP growth was the result of LTL AGP growth of 6% (+0.5% volume and +5.5% AGP per shipment) while TL AGP declined -0.4% (+3% volume and -3.5% AGP per shipment).

· Global Forwarding (27% of 4Q AGP and 23% of adj. operating income) gross revenue declined -17.3% YoY to $731mm, coming in slightly above our estimate of $707mm (-20% YoY) as the volumes were off at both ocean and air while ocean was additionally pressured by lower rates. With this top-line decline, segment adj. operating profit fell -22% to $45mm, though coming in ahead of our $40mm estimate as GF headcount was reduced -12% YoY. The operating results represent a margin of 22.8%, a deterioration of 260bps YoY and a deterioration of 280bps sequentially vs. the 3Q. · The -17% decline in GF AGP was driven by a -22% decline in Ocean AGP (-8% volume and -12.5% AGP per shipment) and a -17.3% decline in Air AGP (-12.5% volume and -5.5% AGP per ton), while Customer AGP grew 30% (+3% volume and +26% AGP per transaction growth).

NAST Results vs. Peers: Highlighted in Figures 7 and 8, CHRW's 4Q NAST results continue to stack up favorably vs. peers, with the segment seeing total volume growth of 1% YoY whereas the peers and industry at large continue to see modest YoY volume declines. Importantly, while brokerage gross margin did face headwinds from rising spot rates, deteriorating 20bps sequentially and missing estimates, overall NAST gross margin of 14.6% was still higher by 20bps YoY as the company was able to hold TL AGP per mile flat YoY and selectively capture higher-margin spot loads to offset pressures on the contractual book of business, demonstrating better margin resilience than in prior cycles.

FCF and Capital Allocation: During the 4Q, CHRW generated $290mm in FCF, representing ~130% of 4Q adj. EBITDA as cash from operations totaled $305mm and capex including software development was just under $16mm. For the full-year 2025, total FCF generation totaled $844mm, up 94% YoY and representing a 90% conversion rate on 2025 adj. EBITDA. In the most recent quarter, the company returned $208mm in cash to shareholders via $133mm in share repurchases and $74mm in dividends. For 2025 as a whole, CHRW returned $733mm in cash to shareholders (~87% of FCF returned to shareholders) via $432mm in share buybacks and $301mm in cash dividends. As we've continued to highlight below, with leverage having trended down to just 1.0x from as high as 2.5x at the beginning of 2024, we would expect CHRW to remain active in share repurchases. This said, the decision to buy back shares will always be weighed against its capital

allocation priorities which are (1) maintaining an investment grade balance sheet, (2) maintaining and growing the dividend, (3) continuing to reinvest into the business to generate strong organic ROIC, and finally (4) M&A and buybacks. As it stands, we currently estimate ~$380mm in buybacks in 2026, and $400mm in 2027.

Estimates Unchanged and Well-Anchored Towards a 20% EPS Growth CAGR: With the puts and takes of the 4Q results and reiterated 2026 outlook, our 2026 and 2027 operating profit and EPS estimates are largely unchanged. Highlighted in Figures 11 and 12 below, while our OP and EPS estimates are unchanged, the math to get there is tweaked slightly with our assumption now calling for slightly lower underlying AGP performance but increased cost-out/headcount reductions. Specifically, while our initial operating cost assumptions were in-line with the explicit outlook provided, for the year-ahead we are comfortably modeling $1.3bn in adj. personnel expense and $565mm in adj. SG&A. We estimate that average headcount will be reduced by 4% in 2026 after being cut 11% in 2025 and 11% in 2024. With no changes to our EPS estimates, we highlight that our estimates call for 20% EPS growth in both 2026 and 2027.

Valuation and PT: With our 2026

and 2027 estimates unchanged but apparently no limit to what valuation multiple the Street is willing to give, we raise our PT ~19% from $160 to $190, which assumes over 31x our 2026 EPS of $6.10 and 26x our 2027 EPS of $7.30, which is above CHRW's historical range of 15x-25x, above its long-term average forward P/E of ~20x, and above the average Mag7 P/ E of 29.5x 1-yr. forward and 24x 2-yr. forward. With this all being said, we think it's important to take stock of what's already baked into earnings growth and valuation. At current price levels, estimates fully bake in 15%-20% EPS growth into the near-future and the valuation multiple as already expanded such that it is now fully valued as an AI hyperscaler with the likes of NVDA, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, and AVGO. With all of this already baked into the stock's price today, while we continue to be impressed by CHRW's execution, we would

find it inappropriate and intellectually dishonest to call for further multiple expansion from here and see risks growing as expectations and sentiment is bordering on frothy.

C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. engages in the provision of freight transportation services and logistics solutions. It operates through the following three segments: North American Surface Transportation and Global Forwarding. The North American Surface Transportation segment provides freight transportation services across North America through a network of offices in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The Global Forwarding segment provides global logistics services through an international network of offices in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Our $190 PT is based on 31x our 2026 EPS estimate and 26x our 2027 EPS, which is above CHRW's 10-year historical range of roughly 15x-25x. Downside risks include economic recession, competition, labor shortages, and its reliance on third-party capacity providers. Upside risks include improving freight market trends, a potential sales of its Global Forwarding segment, and meaningful share repurchase activity.

Jefferies' methodology for assigning ratings may include the following: market capitalization, maturity, growth/value, volatility and expected total return over the next 12 months. The price targets are based on several methodologies, which may include, but are not restricted to, analyses of market risk, growth rate, revenue stream, discounted cash flow (DCF), EBITDA, EPS, cash flow (CF), free cash flow (FCF), EV/EBITDA, P/E, PE/growth, P/CF, P/FCF, premium (discount)/average group EV/EBITDA, premium (discount)/average group P/E, sum of the parts, net asset value, dividend returns, and return on equity (ROE) over the next 12 months.

Jefferies Franchise Picks include stock selections from among the best stock ideas from our equity analysts over a 12 month period. Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a 15% stop loss, and the remainder will have a 20% stop. Franchise Picks are not intended to represent a recommended portfolio of stocks and is not sector based, but we may note where we believe a Pick falls within an investment style such as growth or value.

This report was prepared for general circulation and does not provide investment recommendations specific to individual investors. As such, the financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own investment decisions based upon their specific investment objectives and financial situation utilizing their own financial advisors as they deem necessary. Past performance of the financial instruments recommended in this report should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future results. The price, value of, and income from, any of the financial instruments mentioned in this report can rise as well as fall and may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than the investor's home currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the price of, value of, or income derived from the financial instrument described in this report. To the extent prices are shown in non-US currency, please note that our local currency price targets are based on a currency conversion using an exchange rate as of the prior trading day (unless otherwise noted). Should there be fluctuations in the exchange rate after this

date, that will affect the non-US target prices and should no longer be relied upon. In addition, investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of the underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
