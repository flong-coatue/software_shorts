DSV reported an underwhelming Q4 result in Air & Sea, partially offset by higher than expected profitability in Road and CL. The 4Q 120% FCF conversion was flattered by a large working capital inflow and the special items provisions. The 2026 guide at mid point stands ~4% below consensus and broadly aligned with UBSe of DKK 24.08bn. The 2026 guidance on air and ocean yields came in below consensus, only partially offset by larger synergy benefits than previously expected. For 2027 DSV expects a P&L benefit of DKK 9bn from synergies (vs. UBS DKK 7bn). We believe this will at least partially offset the consensus downgrades around GP/unit in 2027.

We believe over the next months investors' attention will remain on the AI profit improvement opportunity. Management commented on the call around the potential "DKK billions" of benefits associated with AI and further cost optimisation initiatives. We model DKK 3bn of incremental EBIT in 2028 related to AI initiatives (How much could AI improve mid-term EBIT/GP conversion) and DKK 10bn of Schenker synergies (or DKK 1bn more than the company's target).

The US ISM print earlier this week has also supported the share prices for the broader Logistics/Shipping sector. While the trajectory of manufacturing PMI remains unclear from here we note historically during periods of strong PMI expansion (2017/2018) DSV traded close to 25x P/E 12m fwd above the historical average of 21x P/E 12m. To illustrate the upside scenario on our 2028 EPS of DKK 109 applying a peak historical multiple leads to a 2028 fair value of DKK 2,725/share. Discounted back one year to December 2027 leads to a fair value of DKK 2,500/sh. We rate DSV Buy. We include in the next section of our report 15 questions for DSV management.

1. At Q3 2025 management talked about the ambition to increase the combined GP/ unit in Air & Sea. Is this ambition still the case and what magnitude of increase is realistic in the medium term? Are the DSV legacy levels of DKK 8,800 in air and DKK 4,300 in ocean representative? 2. In respect of the Road division, what is the number of white collar employees and what is the split between revenue generation and support/operational staff within the white collar workforce? 3. In early 2025 (pre-Schenker) we calculate the production costs per container in air and ocean, the cost between GP and EBIT per container was up 30% despite an almost doubling in airfreight/seafreight over the last 5 years. This is in contrast with the historical operating leverage associated with the business. Why is this the case and is there scope to meaningfully reduce the production cost per unit going forwards?

4. How can we reconcile the underperformance in air and ocean volumes vs. the broader market growth and the fact that churn for Schenker is lower than 5%? How easy is it to isolate lost volumes due to weak markets in some verticals vs. loss of market share? 5. In respect of the possibility for AI developments to significantly improve staff productivity in the medium term, would the effect on white collar staffing needs likely be similar to the Schenker headcount reduction estimated at 10k-14k FTEs? 6. In respect of the Air & Sea division, to what extent is having a third party TMS a hurdle in deploying AI productivity improvements? It is clear that any Cargowise AI add-ons will bring benefits for all forwarders using the software. Other than the scale benefit DSV has is it easy to complement Cargowise? 7. What is the OPEX associated with developing and deploying additional AI capabilities? CH Robinson has 450 data engineers working on agentic AI deployment. This could represent a cost of DKK300-DKK500m per year for DSV.

8. What is the timeline for AI benefits to materialise? Here, noting the context in which the Road Division does not yet have a unified TMS. How long will it take for Star to be deployed across all Road volumes? 9. How could we split the potential AI benefits between; a. headcount reduction, b. improving gross margins, and c. gaining market share? Similarly, what about the split between Road and Air & Sea? 10. How difficult is replacing the Air & Sea TMS - many industry observers make an analogy with brain surgery? The cost benefits alone do not seem to justify the risk. How critical is it for DSV to have its own TMS system in Air & Sea to improve productivity? What is the timeline for replacing a TMS - some forwarders have seen a multi year transition. How will this fit with the ambition to potentially make more deals in 2027?

11. Looking at the EBIT 2026 building blocks? You talked about ~DKK 4.2bn of incremental synergies y/y, 4 months of incremental Schenker consolidation you mentioned DKK 2bn in the past. The declining yields y/y in air and ocean are the main drag, but what do you expect in terms of incremental EBIT y/y in CL and Road in the underlying business? 12. The underperformance of volumes vs. the market was also attributed to pruning some contracts. When can DSV organic volumes return to organic growth y/y? 13. Contract logistics Q4 Gross profit came well below expectations (-6%) at DKK 5,629m (vs. company cons. DKK 5,992m), but EBIT came well above (+14%) at DKK 1,514m (vs. company cons. DKK 1,327m). The Q3-Q4 EBIT improvement was materially better vs. usual seasonality - what are the main drivers?

14. The Q4 FCF conversion of 120% was supported by a DKK 1.8bn of inflow from working capital and the DKK 1.3bn adjustment for special items. Adjusting for these we calculate the cash conversion was closer to 50%. Are there other moving parts we should consider and what explains this dynamic? 15. What is the q/q development for yields in air and ocean? How much benefit from rolling over Schenker contracts could be seen in 1Q26?

Founded in 1976, DSV is a Danish-based global freight forwarding and contract logistics company, with more than 60,000 employees in more than 90 countries. The company is ranked 2nd in Air and 3rd in Sea globally. DSV has grown organically and via acquisitions: DFDS Transport (2000), Frans Maas (2006), ABX Logistics (2008), UTi (2016) and Panalpina (2019). The company has a good geographic diversification with 62% of group revenues generated in EMEA, 21% in Americas and 17% in APAC.

Risks for DSV include, but are not limited to, volatility in European road freight volumes as well as in global air and sea freight, significant increases or decreases in freight rates, global and localised GDP/Industrial Production growth, union intervention, regulatory intervention and significant event risk, including mergers and acquisitions. In addition, the negotiations of contracts in third-party logistics are opaque and margin risk is a constant threat as customers as well as competitors erode profitability. All these sources of risk could severely affect DSV and hence might impact on profitability. Our price target is derived using the weighted average of a DCF (WACC 7.4%, long-term growth rate 2.5%) and FY27E EV/EBIT multiples discounted back to today's value.
