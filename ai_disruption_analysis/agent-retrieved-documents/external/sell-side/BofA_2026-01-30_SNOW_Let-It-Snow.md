Price objective basis & risk Snowflake (SNOW) Our PO of $275 is based on 17.6x CY26E revenue, or 0.7x EV/R/G, a premium to the infrastructure software group at 5.6x or 0.5x for durability of growth stemming from Snowflake's traction in the AI software market, which has a large, growing TAM of $155bn. Upside risks to our PO: Snowflake recognizes revenue based on actual consumption (versus subscription ratably in arrears). In the event of changes to market sentiment on macro abating and IT spend returning to normal, consumption and revenue growth could quickly reaccelerate which could drive multiple expansion.

Downside risks to our PO: 1) Snowflake trades at a premium to its software large-cap peer group. In the event of changes to market sentiment stemming from global macro uncertainty, or potentially disappointing quarterly revenue results, there could be risk of a potential pullback, 2) The company's consumption model implies more revenue volatility than a traditional subscription model, 3) Snowflake serves in a highly competitive market, which consists of deep-pocketed next-gen DBMS vendors, public cloud vendors and legacy DBMS. An inability to execute on a product roadmap for added capabilities could result in slowing share gains or even share losses.

Snowflake One of the fastest growing stories in software We reiterate Buy on AI data cloud vendor Snowflake (SNOW) , and see it as a top pick . The key debate on SNOW is if P roduct revenue growth can sustain a high 20 %s Y / Y growth rate or even reaccelerate into the 30s . We think this is well within reach . With an expanding portfolio of products and AI tailwinds , we think customers will continue boosting spend with Snowflake . T he blizzard is just starting to form on broad AI adoption , and we think Snowflake will p l ay a foundational role. W e expect its growth to be top tier in infrastructure software (+10% peers) , coupled with expanding FCF margins for years. Our revised $275 PO (was $310) is based on 17.6x EV/CY26E rev s (from 55x C27e FCF) . We change our valuation methodology and revise forecast s for our update d view on growth, risks, peer multiple compression . Fast b ecoming the king of enterprise data in the cloud

Snowflake plays a critical role in helping companies tackle among their biggest challenges: making sense of mountains of data. As an OLAP data lakehouse, SNOW separates storage from compute thus allowing customers to scale up storage and analysis computing power on the fly . That helps clients drive faster results and cost efficiencies. We think SNOW is one of the best at this - and their leadership position will help it further land new customers and capture more workload s from existing ones. Being r elatively expensive is just that … relative SNOW shares are not cheap . Its trades at 12.7 x EV/CY26E revenue, a 12 3 % premium to its infrastructure software peers at 5.6 x. Given SNOW ' s strengths, we think its justified . Not convinced? A djust ing for growth (EV/revenue/growth) SNOW trades at the same multiple ( 0. 5 x vs 0.5x peer s ) . U ltimately, we are confident in the upside potential of the company ' s revenue and FCF, which is very attractive for a business of this scale .

Key risk: Competition gets better driving pricing pressures I f the hyperscalers ( AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google GCP) or private s (Databricks) create strong competing products . T his could driv e pricing pressure . Thus, Snowflake may have to invest heavily in innovation for years to maintain strong differentiation. Also, since Snowflake does not own data centers . T t leverages the same hyperscalers that it could be competing with, giving hyperscalers potential structural advantages. If hyperscalers create " good enough " Data Clouds, this could be a headwind for Snowflake.

Snowflake Metrics to watch: Product revenue, bookings, NRR The key metric to watch is P roduct revenue growth . While it rose 28.7% y/y in F3Q26, it decelerated from +31.5% in F2Q26. SNOW ' s F4Q guidance calls for +27.2% growth at the midpoint, and if results follow historical patterns of approximately 3% upside, growth will reaccelerate to +31%. We think the potential is there. Other metrics to watch include RPO bookings (q/q change in RPO + revenue), which grew 50% in F3Q (vs 25% in F2Q); and NRR which was stable at 125%. Continued gains in these measures could drive better-than expected upside in the future , which could be a catalyst for further multiple expansion. Bull Bear debates for Snowflake Exhibit 1 : Bulls and bears debate tech differentiation, AI tailwinds, growth, margins, and valuation Key Bull versus Bear debates on Snowflake

For an accessible version Merrill clients call 800-637-7455; Merrill Edge Self-Directed clients call 877-653-4732 Bull Bear Technology differentiation • Pace of innovation stays well ahead of the competition • AI Data Cloud differentiation disappears as other vendors offer more competitive offerings • Products like Cortex AI, Snowpark, Unistore, Openflow, and many others, create a one-stop-shop for all things AI analytics • AI analytics skips the data warehouse or lakehouse layer and goes directly to LLM vendors, and/or application vendors • Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) can bridge the gap to Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), taking incremental workload share from traditional OLTP vendors, like MongoDB • The OLTP vendors are the ones to bridge the gap to OLAP, eroding the need for a separate OLAP platform like Snowflake AI • Having an AI Data Cloud like Snowflake is critical for AI to work effectively and efficiently • Other d ata l

akehouses, like Databricks, prove to be the critical platform for AI, resulting in share losses for Snowflake • Data gravity, which Snowflake powers, is how AI products are differentiated, which should driv e increasing demand • Data gravity proves unnecessary for AI, as LLM vendors becomes so good at understanding and reasoning that only the most recent data is needed, destroying the data gravity thesis Growth potential • Product revenue growth accelerates and stays in the 30s, driven by increased adoption of AI use-cases • Product revenue growth has peaked and will begin decelerating, could be driven from lapping benefit from customer only testing AI use-cases • Despite being a consumption model, product revenue growth is consistent, predictable, and up and to the right. • Being a consumption model, product revenue growth is volatile, with growth accelerating and decelerating from quarter to quarter • Net Revenue Retention (NRR) troughed in F1Q26 at 124% and will continue expanding, demonstrating its installed base is putting more workloads on the Snowflake platform

• Net Revenue Retention (NRR) expands and contracts without a clear upward trend, raising questions on optimization risks and peak penetration within the installed base Margin expansion potential • As Snowflake scales, operational efficiencies plus high growth will result in its non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin to expand at a rate faster than peers • As competition increases and growth begins to slow due to scale, Snowflake will need to invest at a higher rate to maintain differentiation and growth • Snowflake becomes the poster child of what a high growth and high profits model consumption model should look like at scale • Already at peak FCF margins while it is in high growth mode, upside will only come from much higher consumption Valuation / Sentiment • Consensus long, and if software category investor sentiment remains constrained, should benefit from narrowing breadth • Sentiment too positive, creating the potential for high volatility with even slight expectation misses

• Upside potential to revenue and free cash flow margins over the coming years makes the current valuation based on Street estimates more palatable • If product revenue growth slows, stock may need to grow into its valuation, which could be challenging • SNOW currently trades at 12 .7 x EV/CY26E revenue and 50 x EV/CY26E FCF, which are premiums to its infrastructure software peer averages at 5.6 x and 29 x, respectively. Valuation matters, but there is scarcity value in stocks that exhibit high growth, strong FCF margins, and is attractively positioned in the AI theme like SNOW. • SNOW's premium valuation multiples could imply much of the good news is already priced in and expectations are high. Thus, any expectations miss on key metrics like Product Revenue or NRR, or a flat-out miss could result in a meaningful drawdown in the stock Source: BofA Global Research BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH The t en Snowflake c harts that matter Exhibit 2 : Product revenue growth forecast to be in the the mid-20s

Non-GAAP operating margins and Adjusted FCF margins, F1Q23 to F4Q28E Source: Company filings, BofA Global Research estimates BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Change in e stimate s and valuation methodology With this note, we are changing o u r valuation methodology from EV/FCF to EV/revenue to better reflect its high growth profile (25%+) and growth potential. We are also changing its peer group to infrastructure software, from growth at a reasonable price (GARP) software, which better reflects the category of software it sells within the broader software universe. Our $275 PO is based on a 17.6x EV/CY26E revenue multiple and 0.7x EV/R/G . This compares to its infrastructure software peers at 5.6x and 0.5x. We believe a premium is warranted given SNOW ' s faster revenue growth profile (i.e., approx. 30% vs. approx. 10% peers). Our prior $310 PO was based on 55x FCF.

We are also tweaking our estimates as we use more conservative assumptions for Product revenue growth and Professional Services revenue growth to account for elevated spending risks in the current macro environment. Our new total revenue estimate for FY2027 E is $5.7 8 bn and for FY28 E is $7.1 1 bn, which are 1.3 % and 4.0 % lower than our prior forecast of $5.86bn and $7.41bn , respectively. Our free cash flow estimates are also revised lower, a result of the lowered revenue forecast. Our new free cash estimate for FY2027 E is $1.47bn and for FY28 E is $1.85bn, which are 1.3 % and 4.0 % lower than our prior forecast of $1.58bn and $2.05bn , respectively.

OLTP : Stands for Online Transactional Processing, which are databases that are fine tuned to record transactions efficiently at scale. Think ATM transactions. Data from OLTP databases are often fed into OLAP platforms to perform analytics. Data Lake: A centralized repository where all sorts of structured and unstructured data in its original format can be stored. Data Lakes tend to be more flexible and cost efficient than Data Warehouses. Data Warehouse:

Data Warehouses are like Data Lakes, as they are also a central repository. The key difference from Lakes is that the data fed into a Warehouse is structured and pre-processed. Data in Warehouses are more structured with less flexibility than Lakes. Data L akehouse : As the name implies, Lakehouses are taking the best of both worlds - Data type flexibility of Lakes, and data structure of Warehouses to allow better analytics. Storage : Where data is stored in the Snowflake platform. Data types can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. The data can be stored in different tables such as Snowflake Tables (Snowflake optimized structure), Apache Iceberg (enables Snowflake compute with external data sources), and Hybrid Tables (optimized for low latency and high throughput). Compute: Virtual warehouses are clusters of computing resources used to analyze stored data. Snowflake separates Compute resources and Storage resource s.
