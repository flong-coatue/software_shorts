4Q25 revenue/adjusted operating income/margin/EPS all outperformed expectations. US Domestic segment delivered its strongest 4Q revenue-per-piece y/y growth in four years at +8.3% y/y. International segment grew revenue-per-piece and revenue y/y. Although Supply Chain Solutions revenue declined, segment adjusted operating margin expanded 100bps y/y. UPS reached its 2025 Amazon volume reduction target/delivered $3.5B in savings via its network reconfiguration/Efficiency Reimagined initiatives. UPS's implied outlook for 1Q26 was cautious on continued Amazon glide-down/transition expenses related to Ground Saver/incremental MD-11 retirement-related costs. However, the latter quarters of 2026 are anticipated

to ramp favorably. Implied 2026 adjusted EPS guidance was relatively consistent with expectations, largely via revenue/adjusted operating margin projected stronger/lighter than expected, respectively. Our 2026E adjusted EPS/target increase from $7.12 to $7.16 (flat y/y)/$107 to $115, respectively.

■ US Domestic. 4Q25 segment revenue/adjusted operating income were -3.2%/-2.7% y/y, respectively. Both significantly exceeded expectations. 4Q25 avg. daily volume (ADV)/revenue per piece (RPP) were -10.8%/+8.3% y/y, respectively. SMBs expanded ~340bps y/y to 31.2% of total US volume. Segment expense was down 3.3%, primarily due to reduced hours and operational positions. 4Q25 adjusted operating margin of 10.2% (+10bps y/y) topped our estimate/consensus of 9.7%/9.7%, respectively.

■ International/SCS. 4Q25 International revenue/adjusted operating income were +2.5%/-14.5% y/y, respectively. ADV decreased 4.7% y/y, while RPP increased 7.1% y/y. Adjusted operating margin of 18.0% (-360bps y/y) compared to our estimate/consensus of 17.5%/17.5%, respectively. 4Q25 Supply Chain Solutions revenue declined 12.7%. Adjusted operating income and margin were -2.8% y/y and 10.3% (+100bps y/y), respectively. ■ Outlook. UPS guided 2026 revenue and adjusted operating margin of ~$89.7B (+1% y/y) and 9.6% (-20bps y/y), respectively. With consideration of UPS's 4Q25 outperformance and 2026 guidance, our 2026E adjusted EPS updates to $7.16 (flat y/y, from $7.12; $7.12 consensus). Our 2027E adjusted EPS updates to $7.74 (+8% y/y; from $7.70; $7.96 consensus).

INDUSTRIAL/CAPITAL GOODS/INDUSTRIAL & BUSINESS SERVICES

■ 2026E and 2027E adjusted EPS $7.16 (flat y/y), and $7.74 (+8% y/ y), respectively ■ A gradually improving economy in the US and globally, following disruption to global trade via geopolitical unrest and tariff uncertainty

■ Significant acceleration in global trade/GDP growth ■ Faster than anticipated profitability improvement ■ Significant improvement in domestic B2B growth

Our $115 target represents 16x our 2026E adjusted EPS. Our target multiple is consistent with UPS's five-year historical FTM EPS multiple average of 16x (12x-20x range). We remain drawn to its industry-leading FCF/ROIC/return of capital (dividend yields 6.1%).

UPS is susceptible to economic slowdowns in all of its markets, as delivery of goods is correlated with business and consumer activity. Any limitation on global trade could also represent a headwind. UPS faces a handful of solid competitors in most of its markets, although its size, service capabilities, and value proposition have afforded it continued rate increases. UPS faces renegotiation risks in dealing with multiple employee unions. Additional concerns include various regulatory matters, pension and medical benefit expense fluctuations, acquisition implementation and integration, forex variation, and energy price volatility.

UPS is the world's largest parcel delivery company. It is a leader in global logistics and supply chain coordination.

The US and global leader in parcel delivery, UPS has a strong balance sheet and derives the highest operating margin and ROIC of its peers. It is expected to deliver a long-term low to midsingle-digit top-line CAGR, with revenue quality management of e-commerce-driven B2C deliveries an important driver, as well as logistics outsourcing services. UPS generates sufficient free cash flow to fund share repurchases and its historically increasing dividend, which presently yields 6.1%.

■ FDX F3Q26 results on 3/19/26 ■ Data points related to overall economic conditions, including US GDP and global GDP/trade ■ UPS 1Q26 results in late-April

■ Significant deceleration in global trade/GDP growth ■ Slower than anticipated profitability improvement ■ Sustained contraction in domestic B2B growth Exhibit 1. U.S. Domestic Segment Revenue Source: Company reports
