Company Update - January 6, 2026

Mobileye Announces Acquisition of Mentee Robotics; Auto Pipeline to $24.5B Over Next 8 Years

We think investors will be focused on the strategic rationale of spending $900M ($612M cash / 3.2% dilution) on a pre-revenue robotics startup. Separately, Mobileye raised its auto pipeline forecast, now at $24.5B thru 2034 (+40% from Jan '23). Mentee Robotics Acquisition. Mobileye announced the $900M acquisition (~$612M cash / 26.2M shares or 3.2% dilution) of humanoid robotics company Mentee Robotics, expected to close in 1Q26. Management noted its expectation for the acquisition to increase opex LSD% in 2026. This pre-revenue humanoid robot startup was founded by Mobileye's CEO, Prof. Amnon Shashua, and will act as an independent unit w/in Mobileye. We expect Mobileye will face a very competitive environment in the robotics space.

Management noted Mentee's key advantages as: 1. A strong technology moat via the integration of RL-based motion models w/ advanced foundation models, and breakthrough simulation only training technologies reducing reliance on large scale realworld data collection (Sim2Real); 2. Vertically integrated hardware & embedded in-house software, noted to include proprietary actuators, precision motor drivers, robotic hands, and hot swap batteries. Company Background. We would note Mentee Robotics, founded in 2022, has held funding rounds in 2022 and 2025 at ~$42M and ~$162M post-money valuations. We would note its venture investor base includes Cisco Investments and Samsung NEXT Ventures. The company has developed 3 generations of robots with the current generation running on NVIDIA Orin chips. Proof of concept deployments are targeted for '26, with non-teleoperation industrial production use in '28 and home use targeted in 2030.

Additional Keynote Highlights. 1. Mobileye disclosed its auto pipeline is now $24.5B thru 2034 +40% from its Jan '23 disclosure. 2. Mobileye disclosed that it now has over 100M EyeQ chips in active RFQs (80% 6L/6H/7H). 3. In its conversation w/ VW Autonomous Mobility CEO, the company is targeting >100k active self-driving vehicles on the road by CY2033. Mobileye's commercial robotaxi rollout is starting in 2027. 4. Surround ADAS ASP estimates were disclosed at 2-4x normal ADAS ASP as a tier 2 supplier and 12-14x as a Tier 1 (no surprise). 5. Mobileye has sampled its EyeQ7H processor with production in 3Q27, with EyeQ 7/8 integration noted to be planned in the Chauffeur (L4) and Drive solutions. 6. Mobileye outlined the ADAS sample stages it is in with Porsche (SOP in 2027), Audi (SOP in 2027-2028), and Valeo (Volkswagen; 2028 SOP),

Our $24 price target reflects a ~6x EV/ sales and ~24x EV/EBIT multiple based on our 2027 ests. This compares to shares of Mobileye trading at roughly 13x NTM EV/ Sales and ~49x NTM EV/EBIT multiples since the Oct '22 IPO.

Our Overweight rating on Mobileye is based on our belief that the company is well positioned to act as a platform play on the autonomous driving industry through the leverage of proprietary software (e.g., computer vision), a crowd-sourced data platform (Road Experience Management, or REM), and internally developed purpose-built silicon (EyeQ System on Chips, or SoCs). We see Mobileye's ecosystem breadth and platform strategy as key longterm differentiators.

*As of 01/06/26 Source: Wells Fargo Securities, LLC estimates and Factset.

In the event of faster-than-expected SuperVision and Chauffeur ramps, we think shares could trade to $35, or ~35x EV/EBIT on our 2027 estimates. Our model includes a 5-year pluggable scenario analysis (available upon request) in which we are particularly focused on Mobileye's Supervision and Chauffeur ramps as upside drivers.

· SuperVision Design Win Expansion through 2026+ · Monthly / Quarterly Derivatives · STMicroelectronics Updates; Aptiv & Valeo Updates. · Increasing confidence in Chauffeur and Drive / Robotaxi production volume ramps into 2026-2027+. · Potential additional future Intel share sales.

Mobileye has established itself as a leader in the development and deployment of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), while also focusing on the development of a platform strategy for the industry evolution toward fully autonomous vehicles (AV). Mobileye's 'platform' approach through the leverage of proprietary software (e.g., computer vision), a crowd-sourced data platform (Road Experience Management, or REM), and internally developed purpose-build silicon (EyeQ System on Chips, or SoCs). In the event Mobileye faces strongerthan-expected competition (expect most notable focus on NVIDIA and Qualcomm competition) or sees industry ADAS L2+; L3/4 adoption rates materialize slower than anticipated, we think shares trade to $12.50, or ~13x EV/EBIT on our 2027 estimates.

ADAS Commentary: Mobileye noted that it is in B sample stage with Valeo (Tier 1) for Volkswagen with full software slated for end of 2026 and SOP 2028. SuperVision at the Porsche is in C sample hardware stage with dozens of vehicles in the testing phase and its Gen2 stack ready for April '26 and SOP in 2027. Audi is B sample stage with prototypes running and SOP in 2027-2028. Robotaxi targeting driver-less in 3Q-4Q of 2026 in the U.S. with a broader rollout in '27 and a focus on minimizing teleoperations. Autonomous Driving in the 2030s: Mobileye laid out how its sees the autonomous driving market evolving in the 2030s with L2++ (eyes-on) systems moving from high-end vehicles to a focus on cost optimization; L3 (eyes-off) moving from eyes-off to mind-off (L4) with ODD moving from highway only today to urban environments, finally robotaxis will accelerate deployments with cost and sensor cost reduction.

EyeQ Roadmap: Mobileye has sampled its EyeQ7H processor with production in 3Q27, with EyeQ 7/8 integration noted to be planned in the Chauffeur (L4) and Drive solutions. Mobileye noted the EyeQ7H can run a 15.6B vision language sematic action at 2.5H up from 3.8B with EyeQ6H. Management also cited its EyeQ6H driving superior latency vs. NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin , at .5msec vs. .64msec, or .932msec vs. 2.63m/sec for 24M params.

Mobileye Participates in a Broad Competitive Environment: Mobileye is positioned as a leading compute semiconductor provider for ADAS. However, the competitive landscape in what appears to be an accelerating secular growth market is intensifying. We think investors should be most concerned about competitive pressure from NVIDIA and Qualcomm.
