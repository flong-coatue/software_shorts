FMG's DQ was solid, with record 1H iron ore shipments and strong realised prices. Hematite costs rose more than expected in 1H due to mine plan/strip ratio, and timing of production vs sales, but this is expected to reverse 2H. Iron Bridge ramp up progresses, with Dec producing >1Mt. Group FY26 guidance is unchanged. The new hematite mine plan and portfolio strategy starts to roll out over 2H. After minor changes for higher costs and stronger realisations, EPS is -1%/+2%/+3% over FY26/27/28E. We have a Neutral rating and a A$20/sh price target. Key catalysts: i) 2H operational performance, ii) iron ore price/discounts, & iii) decarb.

1) Hematite shipments 48.3Mt in line, C1 cost US$19.10/wmt (1H US$18.64/wmt) was above UBSe/cons., reflecting variable strip ratio (=cost) and timing of production vs sales. But strip ratio is expected to be a 2H tailwind, so FY26 guidance of US$17.5-18.5/ wmt is maintained. Realised price US$92.88/dmt, 88% of Platts 62% (90% Platts 61%) with low grade discounts remained tight. 2) Iron Bridge shipments 2.2Mt, +q/q but lagged UBSe/cons., as ramp up continues. Month of Dec >1Mt, & nameplate 22Mtpa still due FY28. Realised price in line @ 102% of Platts 65% index. 3) Decarbonisation: 250MWh BESS operational at North Star Junction, 4-5GWh total BESS. Twelve electric excavators and two 14.5MWh

electric locomotives operational. Decarb spend accelerating with peak deployment 2027/28/29 (& lower C1 as diesel/gas is replaced). 4) FY26 guidance: Unchanged: Total shipments 195-205Mt (UBSe 202Mt), incl. 10-12Mt Iron Bridge (100%); Hematite C1 US$17.50-18.50/wmt @ AUD 0.65 (UBSe US$18.3); Iron Bridge opex US$650m. 5) Capex: US$759m spent in 2Q (US$1.7b 1H), and on track for FY26 guidance of US$3.3-4.0b metals and US$300m energy capex. 6) Exploration/Portfolio: US$82m focused on White Knight (iron ore), Belinga (iron ore, Gabon), with Presidential Taskforce to accelerate infrastructure; critical

minerals (Argentina, NSW & QLD). FMG also agreed to acquire the 64% of Canada's Alta Copper it does not own. 7) Financials: Cash US$4.7b, Gross Debt US$5.8b, Net Debt US$1.0b.

1) Iron Ore continues to surprise, but with >3yr high port stocks, Simandou ramp up and muted Chinese growth, price risks remain tilted to downside. 2) Operations: Iron Bridge ramp up progress, and strip ratio/cost stabilisation 2H key. 3) Decarbonisation and emergent tailwinds to lower C1 costs next 12-24mths.

We value FMG on 50:50 1x NPV and 5¾x NTM EV/EBITDA.
