Auto analysts perceive EV demand as weak, while upstream analysts view demand as robust, supporting elevated battery material prices. This disconnect pressures CATL, but irrationally - material price strength and weak battery demand cannot coexist sustainably. The market currently reflects a sharp disconnect: Auto analysts anticipate weak EV demand, implying slower battery volume growth. Material analysts, conversely, expect strong demand driven by the ESS market, supporting elevated prices for battery raw materials. This divergence has pressured CATL's positioning, making it one of the least preferred stocks amid concerns over cost pass-through and margin compression.

Our views: We believe this view is irrational. If demand were truly weak, CATL would cut orders, and material prices would not remain as strong as they appear. Similarly, if CATL cannot pass through cost inflation, it would likely reduce orders, which would eventually drive a correction in material prices. Market expectations are likely to converge as fundamentals normalize, and CATL's premium exposure, pricing power, and strategic positioning in the ESS market should enable it to outperform peers once sentiment realigns.

Scenario 1: Demand truly weak If EV and battery demand is as weak as auto analysts suggest, CATL would cut orders to align with lower production needs. Such order reductions would undermine material demand, causing battery material prices to correct downward. Implication: Current material price strength is unsustainable against a backdrop of weak demand. Scenario 2: Cost inflation cannot be passed through If CATL cannot pass through rising material costs, it would likely reduce procurement volumes to protect margins. This would trigger a secondary correction in material prices, as upstream suppliers face oversupply. Importantly, marginal-cost battery producers - tier-2 battery companies - would suffer disproportionately. These players lack pricing power and financial buffers, and if cost inflation cannot be passed through, many would likely exit the market, accelerating industry consolidation.

Both scenarios highlight that material price strength and weak battery demand cannot coexist sustainably. Market expectations will converge as fundamentals normalize. Moreover, CATL has a proven track record of passing through cost increases during prior material inflation cycles, which were even more severe than the current one. This reinforces our confidence in CATL's ability to protect margins despite near-term volatility. We believe etruck and ESS robustness will largely drive earnings growth in 2026/27, along with the company's high exposure to the premium EV market, allowing it to pass through cost inflation, if any.

- n Base case, EV/EBITDA. We use this methodology to remain consistent with the approach taken by our global battery analysts for international peers. We assign a 17x EV/EBITDA multiple to 2026E EBITDA, which implies a 25x P/E for 2026E and a 1x PEG, based on a 25% five-year earnings CAGR, in line with the average PEG level over the past three years.
