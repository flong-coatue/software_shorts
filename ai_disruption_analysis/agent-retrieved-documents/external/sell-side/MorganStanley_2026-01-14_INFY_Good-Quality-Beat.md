| What's Changed Infosys Limited (INFY.NS)   | From       | To         |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|------------|
| Price Target                               | Rs1,640.00 | Rs1,760.00 |

Midpoint of F26 revenue guidance implies the strongest 4Q in the last four years. Net new large deal wins TTM up notably in the trailing 12 months (+26% YoY). Improved discretionary spending across select verticals. We see acceleration of ~200bps in organic growth in F27e . INFY's trading discount to HCLT (-7%) could close.

More positives than negatives in 3QF26: a) Revenue growth of 0.6% QoQ cc beat our estimate (flat) - more importantly, this is despite lower QoQ contribution of third-party items (usually 3Q has higher third-party), implying a good beat on core services revenues. b) Large deal wins were strong overall - share of net new (on a TTM basis) at ~60% is one of the highest in the last several years. c) Full-year guidance upgrade of 50bps on the top end is material, especially with only one quarter left for the year - this shows greater confidence in exiting 4Q on a stronger note than in previous years, which positions the company for a good start next year. d) Strong net headcount addition with lower utilization QoQ implies good visibility.

Street estimates to move up for F27, albeit only marginally until the annual guidance event: We think the current set of results shall drive an upgrade to Street estimates. Consensus F27e cc revenue growth is at 4.4% YoY - we think this could move up 40-60bps now. We lift our F27e revenue growth to 5.4% from 4%, which implies a 60bps rise on an organic basis. We see any material upgrades now as less likely given a) management commentary on discretionary spending improvement is still limited to select verticals, b) investors would wait for annual revenue guidance in April 2026 before underwriting a broad-based recovery across verticals.

Room to close multiple gap vs. HCLT: With these results, we see investors' expectations drifting towards largely similar organic revenue growth for F27 (~5%) for both HCLT and Infosys. Further, on a three-year basis (F24-27e), EBIT CAGR for both looks largely similar. Last, Infosys has done well in improving its net income to FCF in the last two years (F25/F26e). Thus, we see room for INFY's multiple to catch up to HCLTs in the near term, although absolute P/E (~20x F28e) may have limited upside potential with revenue growth still remaining well below pre-COVID levels. We have lifted our F26-28e EPS 1-3.4%. Our price target increases by 7%, also reflecting a three-month roll-forward of our DCF. Morgan Stanley India Company Private Limited+

Order intake: For 3Q, Infosys reported large-deal total contract value (TCV) of US$4.8bn (26 large deals including two mega-deals, 57% net new). Management noted that the deal momentum is broad based with notable mega-deals such as the USD1.6bn NHS engagement (which is expected to materially expand the company's presence in healthcare and AI enabled services). Large-deal wins included 16 from North America, nine from Europe, and one in ROW. By vertical, there were two deals each in High Tech, Communications, and EURS verticals (Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services); three each in Life Sciences and Manufacturing; four in Retailand 10 in Financial Services.

· Manufacturing : continues to face tariff related uncertainties and weak discretionary spending, especially in automotive, although pockets such as industrials serving data center buildouts remain healthy; companies are focusing heavily on cost optimization, consolidation, and ERP modernization. · EURS (Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services) is experiencing increasing discretionary demand, supported by growing investments in AI infrastructure, cloud, and data platforms. · Retail: remains softer owing to ongoing tariff negotiations and geopolitical shifts, which are causing clients to prioritize AI led productivity and cost takeout deals, while discretionary projects remain muted. · Communications: remains weighed down by macro and geopolitical uncertainty, though earlier won deals are helping a gradual YoY acceleration; clients are increasingly pursuing outcome based models and AI driven operational efficiency programs. · Hi-tech: The sector is facing cost pressures, with clients focused on productivity benefits.

Gen AI: Infosys highlighted that it now works with 90% of its top 200 clients on AI programs and is currently executing 4,600 AI projects. Partnerships such as the one with Cognition (Devin agent) are enabling Infosys to pursue work like modernization that was previously too complex, long cycle, or cost prohibitive, thereby unlocking new categories of addressable demand rather than cannibalizing existing work. Margins: Adjusted operating margin for the quarter stood at 21.2%, expanding 20 bps sequentially, primarily supported by currency tailwinds (40bps) and benefits from Project Maximus (40), although these were partially offset by furloughs and fewer working days. The company got a one-off margin gain of 35bps from the sale of PPE, but that was offset by higher variable pay. The reported margin was lower at 18.4% because of a one time charge relating to India's updated labor codes. The labor law change will have a 15bps recurring margin impact. M

Outlook: Infosys raised its F26 revenue growth guidance to 3.0-3.5% in constant currency, reflecting confidence from strong deal wins and improving discretionary trends in financial services and energy/utilities, while maintaining its operating margin guidance at 20-22%. Management expects F27 to be stronger than F26, specifically for Financial Services and EURS, driven by deal wins, robust deal pipelines, and deep AI penetration within top clients. M

Revenue acceleration potential in F27 (vs. F26) but limited upside potential

DCF, probability-weighted: bull (20%), bear (20%), base (60%). Our bull case reflects strong client spending leading growth in volumes and revenue to pick up, while our bear case reflects budget pressures leading to significantly lower revenue growth than expected. We assume an 11.3% CoE and 4.5% terminal growth across scenarios.

Implies ~26.8x bull case F2027e EPS Better - than - expected tech spending : Strong client spending leads growth in volumes and revenue to pick up. Operating leverage helps with higher-than-expected margin expansion.

Implies ~22.6x base case F2027e EPS Revenue growth momentum : We expect better organic revenue growth in F2027 relative to F2026. We see margin improvement potential but investments in the new tech cycle can keep it stable.

▪ We view Infosys as a high-quality large-cap stock with good client diversification and a strong customer base. With better exit revenue run rate by the end of this year (vs. the last) and stronger net new deal wins, it can narrow the organic growth gap with HCLT. ▪ We expect the company to keep margins in a narrow band, as any benefit from Project Maximus will provide buffer for investments to focus on revenue growth, in our view. ▪ On valuation, we think the stock's discount to HCLT can close given the growth gap narrowing, but even that provides limited upside potential.

Implies ~18.1x bear case F2027e EPS Budget pressures : These lead to significantly lower revenue growth than expected. Margins erode because of price pressure and lack of operating leverage from growth. M

Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold and sell. Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone. In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice. An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations. M

Equal-weight (E). The stock's total return is expected to be in line with the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Not-Rated (NR).

Underweight (U). The stock's total return is expected to be below the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months.

Unless otherwise specified, the time frame for price targets included in Morgan Stanley Research is 12 to 18 months.
