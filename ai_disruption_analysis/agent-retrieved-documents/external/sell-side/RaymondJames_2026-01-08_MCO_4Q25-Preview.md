We maintain our Market Perform rating on Moody's shares ahead of the company's 4Q25 results. Broadly healthy issuance during the quarter should provide a modest boost to 4Q25 results, and close out a year for issuance that was better than our initial expectations. Moody's has also delivered notably strong incremental margins within MIS while pivoting to a margin expansion story within Moody's Analytics. That being said, despite the currently favorable macro backdrop we prefer to err on the side of a conservative ratings outlook for 2026 as we think some widening of credit spreads is likely to occur at some point. All in, with Moody's currently trading ~33x our 2026 non-GAAP EPS estimate we view the risk/reward as relatively balanced.

● Summary: Global bond issuance during 4Q25 was generally healthy compared to the yearago period despite a slowdown in leveraged loan and financial institutions issuance activity. Our 4Q25 MIS revenue estimate of $938 million is slightly above the current consensus estimate of $905 million. Please see here for more insight into 4Q25 and 2025 global bond issuance activity. ● Generally strong 4Q25 issuance despite leveraged loan weakness: Within the

subcomponents of non-financial corporate debt, investment grade issuance was up 111% y/y, while high yield was up 46% y/y, both against light comps. However, leveraged loan issuance was down 51% y/y against a notably tough comp. Of the ~$239 billion in total leveraged loan volume in 4Q25, 65% was tied to repricing activity, which compares to 72% in 3Q25 and 79% in the prior-year period, which should result in higher average fees for Moody's. Moving to structured finance, all areas we track were up relative to the year-ago period. Specifically, ABS and CMBS issuance were up 45% and 16% y/y, respectively, while CDO issuance rose 18% from the prior-year period despite a modestly tough comp. Within financial institutions, bank bond issuance activity was down 6% y/y, while insurance bond issuance was down 10% y/y against a tough comp. Lastly, municipal bond issuance finished the quarter up 15% y/y. As a result of generally strong

issuance, our 4Q25 Moody's ratings revenue is increased to $938 million from $920 million, which compares to $1.098 billion in 3Q25 and $809 million in 4Q24. ● Estimates: Our full-year 2025 non-GAAP EPS estimate increases by $0.10 to $14.66, reflecting generally healthy 4Q25 issuance and slightly higher average fees for bank bond issuance. Our 2026/2027 non-GAAP EPS estimates increase by $0.40 to $16.10/$17.65, which reflects a slightly better, but still relatively conservative outlook, for credit market conditions.

Several factors enter into the compensation determination for an analyst, including: i) research quality, ii) team productivity, iii) client feedback, iv) rating accuracy, v) overall revenue and profitability levels of the department and firm (a portion of which is generated by investment banking activities) and vi) compensation levels for comparable research analysts at competing firms.

We value capital markets companies using a blended average of a discounted cash flow analysis and a P/E-derived fair value estimate. Capital markets companies often generate free cash flow in excess of net income and the discounted cash flow analysis takes this into account. Further, we believe apply a P/E multiple to a company's projected future earnings is the generally accepted method to value market data and financial analytics firms. We derive a company's forward multiple based on peer evaluation and the company's historical range. Our estimation of an appropriate multiple takes into account several factors, including the economic cycle, expected growth rates, and risk characteristics.

Following are some general risk factors that pertain to the businesses of the subject companies and the projected target prices and recommendations included on Raymond James research: (1) Industry fundamentals with respect to customer demand or product/service pricing could change and adversely impact expected revenues and earnings; (2) issues relating to major competitors or market shares or new product expectations could change investor attitude toward the sector or this stock; (3) Unforeseen developments with respect to the management, financial condition or accounting policies or practices could alter the prospective valuation.

Debt issuance volatility: Moody's Investors Service earns the majority of its revenues from issuance-dependent transactions. As a result, MIS revenue is highly dependent upon issuance volumes which can fluctuate significantly depending on macroeconomic conditions. Integration risk: Moody's Analytics has executed numerous transactions over the past several years and integrating these various businesses poses potential challenges in terms of delivering expected cost savings and revenue cross-selling opportunities. Regulatory risk: Following the global financial crisis regulatory oversight of credit rating agencies (CRAs) significantly increased. The SEC in the U.S. and ESMA in Europe consistently review the practices of CRAs, monitoring for compliance lapses or other deficiencies.

Moderate Risk/Provide Income (M/INC) Larger capitalization, lower volatility (beta) equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings, and dividend yields meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. Many securities in this category are structured with a focus on providing a consistent dividend or return of capital. Moderate Risk/Wealth Accumulation (M/ACC) Larger capitalization equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings growth, the potential for long-term price appreciation, and often a dividend yield. Moderately Aggressive Risk/ Provide Income (MA/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a dividend meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. These companies typically feature sound financials, positive earnings, and the potential for long-term price appreciation. Moderately Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (MA/ACC) Generally equities of companies in fast growing and competitive industries with less predictable earnings (or losses), potentially more

leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, and potential risk of principal. Aggressive Risk/Provide Income (A/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a meaningful dividend but may face less predictable earnings (or losses), more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, financial and competitive issues, higher price volatility (beta), and meaningful risk of loss of principal. Securities of companies in this category may have a more volatile income stream from dividends or distributions of capital. Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) Generally equities of companies with a short or unprofitable operating history, limited or less predictable revenues, high risk associated with success, high volatility (beta), potential significant financial or legal issues, and the meaningful risk of loss of principal.

RJL has developed a proprietary algorithm for risk rating individual securities. The algorithm utilizes data from multiple vendors, and all data is refreshed at least monthly. Accordingly, suitability ratings are updated monthly. The suitability rating shown on this report is current as of the report's published date. In the event that a suitability rating changes after the published date, the new rating will not be reflected until the analyst publishes a subsequent report.
