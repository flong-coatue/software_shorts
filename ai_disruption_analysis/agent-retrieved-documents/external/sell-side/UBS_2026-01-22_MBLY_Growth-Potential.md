Net: MBLY's long-term aperture may be broadening with products aimed towards robotaxis and humanoids (with the Mentee acquisition), but growth inflection seems further out to us. 2026 is an 'execution year' with topline guided +2% y/y. Based on the cadence of advanced products, 2027 growth should step up but only modestly, and we believe consensus needs to move closer to our forecast (UBS ~16% below consensus revenue). We do see stronger growth potential in 2028 with the confluence of increasing revenue from SuperVision, Surround ADAS, robo-taxi and maybe even some humanoids. But, even consensus 2028 revenue sets a high bar, in our view. Judging when the inflection takes place could be difficult, so while the long-term opportunities can drive a sharp inflection, we'd prefer to see outer-year estimates at more reasonable expectations. We remain Neutral rated and tweak our PT to $12 from $13.

 Sales and units: 2026 sales guidance of $1.90-$1.98bn is underpinned by a ~37mm EyeQ unit assumption. Bridging to 37mm units: MBLY did ~35.6mm units in 2025, then: 1) MBLY assuming -0.5mm units in China, 2) top 10 customers down 2%, but MBLY growing 6% with them (so ~8% outgrowth or +1.9mm units y/y). But, we'd point out that ~700k units are for 1 program that decided to add a second EyeQ4 for additional functionality, so really this is ~6% outgrowth. This "extra chip" does weigh on ASP (by ~$0.30) and GM%.

We note ASPs are down implied ~$0.80 with the balance "mix" (more lower-end) related. MBLY did try to imply that EyeQ volume assumptions could prove to be conservative. For instance, 1Q26 shipments guided to ~10 mm units, implying a lower quarterly 2Q4Q run-rate of ~9mm units. This could add cushion should memory, tariff or other negative volume impacts occur. We estimate the sales guide implies an SV unit assumption flat to slightly down.

 Gross margin %: 2026 closer to ~67% vs. 67.7% in 2025, driven by: 1) lower ASP/GM% from 700k second chip units at a key customer (second chip comes in at lower ASP and lower margin vs 1st chip) and 2) higher EyeQ5 mix (~15% of EyeQ volume), which comes at a lower margin.  Adj. operating income: 2026 adj. OI guidance of $170-$220mm. MBLY did $280mm OI in 2025. Revenues could be up modestly but lower GM% (see above). Then, 2025 opex was ~$1bn and 2026 guided to ~$1.1bn from: 1) Mentee R&D (~$40mm), 2) regular "inflation" (~$50mm), and 3) Appreciation of the Shekel, offset by the 4Q25 workforce initiative.

We model 2027 revenue at ~$2.06bn (+7% y/y), but this is ~16% below consensus (~ $2.5bn). We see base ADAS as fairly steady y/y. The Surround ADAS programs are likely to launch late '27, so we put this more in '28. SuperVision (which was pushed from late '26 to early '27) likely has a slow ramp (consensus SV units seem ~40% too high, contributing to ~$100mm revenue delta between UBS/consensus). Drive may start to come in, but again, we believe slowly. While all these advanced programs should start to grow, the actual timing of when they do is very much out of MBLY's control, so we take a prudent approach.

42x (unchanged) target multiple is inline with the past 1-year average and warranted, in our view, as it balances slower growth near-term with significant growth potential longer-term.

We are updating our estimates to reflect 4Q25 results, 2026 guidance, and updated commentary on costs and the go forward ramp of all product lines.
