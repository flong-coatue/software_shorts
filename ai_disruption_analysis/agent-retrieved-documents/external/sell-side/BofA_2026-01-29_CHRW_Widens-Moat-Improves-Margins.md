Price objective basis & risk C.H. Robinson (CHRW) Our $225 price objective is based on a 37.0x target multiple of our 2026 EPS estimate, above its 20-year 17x-27.5x range as earnings scale on AI productivity gains, led by CHRW's focus on productivity and continued share repurchases. We believe CHRW benefits with low spot rates at the bottom of the freight environment, and is positioned to capture profitable share as the spot market inflects. CEO Dave Bozeman has launched a new operating plan blending LEAN architecture, a rebuilt senior management team, and accelerating the automation/digitalization of the broker process to accelerate share gains/volume growth (relative to market), and improve margins.

Downside risks to our price objective are the continued inability to pass along rate increases faster than capacity cost increases (or decreases for both), which would negatively impact margins. Also, a prolonged economic downturn, increased fuel headwinds, increased pricing pressure within the third party logistics industry, changes in the company's customer base due to consolidation, and changes in relationships with its truck, ocean, and air carriers could also impact returns, as well as its ability (or inability) to blend recent acquisitions.

C.H. Robinson Bozeman's Lean AI p roductivity le a ds beat , winning share C.H. Robinson Worldwide posted a dj. 4Q25 EPS of $1.23, up 2% year-year, above our $1.14 target and Street ' s $1.13 estimate. The company is the defining model of benefits from agentic AI implementation, as it driv es continued momentum via share gains, AI-driven productivity improvement, and margin increases . The company reduced headcount 13% year-year ( above our - 12% target ) , and Personnel and SG&A costs below the midpoint of its 2026 targets. It continued to win share in North American Surface Transportation (NAST, 72% of Gross Revenue) at an 800-1000 bps clip , with combined NAST Truckload and Less-than-Truckload volume growth of 1% year-year, outpacing the CASS Shipment Index ' s - 7.6% decline . It posted adj gross profit (AGP) margin of 14.6%, up 20 bps year-year

(despite a higher % of contractual volume and squeeze impacts from pronounced 4Q25 spot rate inflection). CHRW targets double-digit productivity improvements in NAST and Global Forwarding in 2026 (after DD and HSD improvement in 2025 , respectively) as it continues to implement agentic AI. CFO Damon Lee reiterated the company remains well-positioned to achieve its $6.00 2026 EPS target (we are $6.10) , with no market volume growth, and mid-cycle mid-30% enterprise operating margins (we are 34.2% in 2026). Beyond 2026, CHRW retain s optionality to deliver demonstrable growth (as it meets its mid-cycle operating margin targets) . Productivity led beat ; sees demonstrable gains continuing Net revenues were $657 mil, down 4% year-year, $9 mil below our target. Operating expenses were $460 mil, down 8% y-y, $16 mil below our target . Operating income was $197 mil, up +7% y-y, $7 mil above our target ($0.04/sh above )

, for a net operating margin of 30.1%, a 320 bps improvement y-y, and 150 bps better than our target. Raise PO to $225 - AI ramp allow s it to outpace peers We reiterate our Buy on CHRW ' s shares and increase our PO to $ 225 from $18 8 on 3 7 x our ' 26e (from 3 1 .0x). We increase our target above its 17x-30x range as CHRW is structurally gaining share, improving margins, reducing its cost base , and widening its moat vs. its peers . We increase our 2026e EPS 1% to $6.10, from $6.05, above CHRW ' s 2026 scenario of $6.00 with no market growth, and Street ' s $5.99.

BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Targets lower Personnel Expense, more productivity in '26 CHRW targets $1.25 - $ 1.35 b illion in 2026 Personnel Expense (we target $1.30 billion), down 3% year-year at the midpoint. It also targets $540 million -$590 million in SG&A (up 2% at the midpoint, we target $561 million), which includes Depreciation & Amortization of $95-$105 million (we target $101 million). It also targets $75 - $85 million in 2026 CapEx (we are $80 million) and expects 18%-20% in 2026 tax rate (we target 19.6%). CHRW continues to focus on driving efficiency gains and aims to increase

NAST and Global Forwarding productivity by double digits in 2026, after improving productivity double digits and high-single digits, respectively, in 2025. In NAST, CHRW continues to widen its advantage of how it buys capacity in the market, in part from its use of digital capacity reps, which often outperform its human capacity reps. Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer Arun Rajan highlighted how CHRW ' s technology allows it to scale, suggesting that CHRW could ramp from 600k to 6 million requests for freight quotes without having to add additional headcount (given its builder vs buyer culture for its technology) . In Global Forwarding, CEO Dave Bozeman noted CHRW is still in the early innings of productivity ramps as it continue s to implement agentic AI across its quote-to-cash lifecycle of an order . NAST margins improve year-year, despite Dec squeeze NAST Revenues were $2.8 billio n, up 0.3% year-year, but $38 million below our target. CHRW continued to win share as i

t posted combined NAST Truckload and Less-than-Truckload volume growth of 1% year-year, outpacing the CASS Shipment Index ' s 7.6% decline . NAST Adj. Gross Profit was $412 million, up 2% year-year, but $16 million below our target, for an Adj. Gross Profit Margin of 14.6%, up 20 bps year-year, despite a higher of contractual volume (to 70%, from 65% in 4Q24) and squeeze impacts from pronounced 4Q25 spot rate inflection . Truck pricing (what it gets from shippers) was up 2.5%, while truck capacity cost (what it pays to truckers) was up 2.5% year-year, a 0 bps gap, flat from the 0 bps gap last quarter. NAST adjusted operating income was $150 million, up 12% year-year, but $7 million below our target. Global F orwarding beat on productivity ga ins

Global Forwarding Revenues were $731 million, up 17% year-year, $11 million above our target. Global Forwarding Adj. Gross Profit was $178 million, $ 2 million below our target, for an Adj. Gross Profit Margin of 24.3%, a 120 bps improvement year-year, but 70 bps worse than our target. Ocean Adjusted Gross Profit was down 22% year-year, better than our -35% target, due to a 15.0% decrease in AGP per shipment and an 8.0% decline in shipments. Ocean AGP weakness was led by lower ocean rates. CFO Damon Lee anticipates continued normalization of ocean rates in 1Q26 (we target ocean net revenues down 7% sequentially and down 20% year-year in 1Q26). Air AGP decreased 17% year-year, due to a 12.5% decline in metric tons shipped and a 5.5% decrease in AGP per metric ton shipped . Customs AGP increased due to a 26.0% increase in adjusted gross profit per transaction and a 3.0% increase in volume .

Global Forwarding Operating Income was $46 million, down 17% year-year, yet $11 million above our target. Adj. Operating expenses decreased 11% year-year, primarily due to cost optimization efforts, productivity improvements, and lower incentive compensation.

New CEO Dave Bozeman is driving an overhaul of CHRW as it launches a new operating model, drives systemic improvements, aims to benefit from its status as the largest truck brokerage provider with scale benefits (and through its adoption of automation), while still balancing results with volume growth. It is taking advantage of a sustained loose trucking market and improved ocean shipping market given red sea disruptions globally. Given that, we can see valuation return to premium levels
