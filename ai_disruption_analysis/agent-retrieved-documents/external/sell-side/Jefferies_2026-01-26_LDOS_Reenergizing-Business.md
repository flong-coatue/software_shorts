USA | Aerospace & Defense Electronics

CEO Tom Bell announced his first major acquisition since becoming CEO nearly 3 years ago. LDOS announced ENTRUST an energy infrastructure engineering biz for $2.4BB or 3.4X '26 Sales and 16X EBITDA net of tax asset. The transaction is 1% accretive to 2027 EPS taking net debt to 2.6X. The deal brings LDOS commercial energy offering to $1.3BB in sales or 7% of PF total revs growing DD. Leidos to Acquire ENTRUST for $2.4BB. Leidos announced the acquisition of ENTRUST, an energy infrastructure engineering business, for $2.4BB w/ a ~$200MM tax asset. Based on the expected ~$650MM of 2026 revenue and low 20% adjusted EBITDA margins the deal represents 3.4X 2026 revenue and 16X implied 2026 EBITDA of $137MM after tax asset. The business is expected to grow mid-teens with the deal expected to close in Q2:26.

Deal Could be 1% Accretive to 2027 Adjusted EBITDA. Leidos expects the acquisition of ENTRUST to be immediately accretive to Leidos revenue growth (est 5% organic in 2026E and 3.8% 2026-28E CAGR) and adjusted EBITDA margins along with accretive to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. On a run-rate basis, 2026 revenue represents 4 pts to the LDOS revenue base with implied EBITDA a 6 pt contribution. Assuming a 10% growth rate with EBITDA margins of 21%/22.5% and 23.0% for ENTRUST in 2026 to 2028 the deal is about 1% accretive to 2027 adjusted EPS estimates of $12.85 and ~30 bps accretive to 2027 EBITDA margins (13.6% PF vs. 13.3% on a standalone). The opportunity to drive further accretion is tied to revenue and cost synergies along with debt paydown and lowering the cost of funds.

Background and Strategic Rationale - Doubling the Energy Base. ENTRUST, founded in 1998, is a provider of engineering, consulting design, asset integrity, and data solutions services to utilities customers worldwide. Kohlberg, a MM PE firm, acquired ENTRUST in 2019 from a set of PE firms incl Brookside, CIVC, Apogem, and General Atlanitc. In 2023, ENTRUST was recapitalized with a minority stake by Neuberger Berman Alternatives. Under Kohlberg, ENTRUST has acquired a set of 8 assets incl Maskwa High Voltage in 2024 most recently. The asset generates $650MM of 2026 revs growing at an est mid-teens rev growth rate and generating low-20% EBITDA margins. The acquisition is expected to support LDOS' $650MM Commercial Energy infrastructure engineering business, which has grown at a double-digit rate with DD margins for the past 8 years.

Adding Scale w/ Focus on LDOS Growth Pillar. LDOS' business focuses on transmission and distribution for commercial electric utilities, whereas ENTRUST broadens the customer base from generation to transmission and distribution across both gas (~40% of ENTRUST revs) and electric (~55% of ENTRUST) utilities. ENTRUST generates ~5% of revs from non-utility work. LDOS believes that the energy and utility market will continue to grow at an accelerated pace w/ a 32% increase in electricity use by 2030. The average large power transformer is 40+ yrs old and the average age of US gas distribution pipelines is 40% yrs old, implying significant repair and replacement demand. There is $21.4TT to be invested in electricity grids by 2050 and ~$30BB of 2025 capex for US gas utilities.

Preserving B/S Capacity - Deal Only Adds a Turn of Leverage vs. 1.6X Q3 End. Leidos expects to finance the deal w/ $1.4BB in new debt, $500MM in cash + $500MM in C/P. This compares to the Q3 ending cash of $974MM w/ debt of $4.7BB for a net leverage ratio of 1.6X. This excludes an expected $329MM of FCF that is expected in Q4. With $1.9BB of new debt and $500MM of cash

Leidos Holdings is a ~$14BB applied technology company that delivers services and solutions in the national security, health, and engineering markets. The company currently derives ~92% of its business from domestic clients. In August 2016, Leidos purchased LMT's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, transforming into an industry giant that leads its peers in scale and service offering breadth. LDOS has completed four acquisitions since the beginning of 2020, Dynetics, LHX SD&A, 1901 Group, and Gibbs & Cox. Dynetics contributed $1.02BB in the first year. LDOS operates three main segments: Defense Systems, Civil, and Health. Our blended PT is based on discounts to the market multiple of 1) 2026E EV/EBITDA; 2) 2026E EPS; and 3) 2026E FCF yield. Risks include customer concentration, contract mix, and integration issues.

Our blended PT is derived using: i) FY2 EV/EBITDA, ii) FY2 P/E, and iii) FY2 FCF Yield. Primary risk is uncertainty on DoD budget.

Our price target is based on: i) EV/EBITDA; ii) P/E; and iii) FCF yield. Risks include acquisition integration risk and competitive bidding.

We arrive at a blended price target based on peer multiples: 1) EV/EBITDA, 2) FCF yield, 3) P/E. Risks include failure to integrate acquisitions, delays in JV programs, loss of key contracts, and selling pressure from ESOP participants.

We arrive at our $110 PT for SAIC using three valuation methods on our FY27 estimates: 1) EV/EBITDA of 11.4x (25% discount vs. 3-yr avg 16% disc) arrives at a valuation of $127; 2) 13.3x (40% disc to S&P vs. 3-yr avg 31% disc) our FY27E EPS of $9.50 arrives at a valuation of $127; and 3) a FCF yield of 17.1% (80% disc to S&P vs 3-yr avg 48%) arrives at a PT of $77. Risks include government end-market/macro volatility and competition.

Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a 15% stop loss, and the remainder will have a 20% stop.
