Coming off strong momentum over the last few months, 4Q results posted a solid beat with EPS 8% above as US ADV, RPP, and margin all came in better than expected. Moreover, the initial 2026 outlook looks in-line with revenues above expectations but total margin a bit light vs. the consensus. Overall, we think the 4Q results show strong execution with more to come in 2026 and 2027 as we lap against the AMZN glide-down. Conf. call 8:30am.

2026 Guide Looks In-Line on Higher Revs But Muted Margin Expectation: Importantly, in conjunction with the 4Q results (which were a beat), UPS provided initial 2026 guidance that looks 7-8% above our estimate but roughly in-line with the consensus . For the full-year 2026, revenues are expected to be ~$89.7bn (+1% YoY) while adj. operating margin is expected to contract 20bps YoY to 9.6% . Highlighted in Figure 1, we note that while the top-line outlook is above the consensus estimate, the margin outlook is lighter resulting in what looks to be an in-line outlook on operating profit for the year. We estimate that the guide implies ~$7.10 in EPS vs. our $6.60 estimate and the consensus $7.12.

4Q25 Results Beta Again as US Margin Comes in Above: UPS reported 4Q25 results with adj. EPS ~8% above expectations on better-than-expected margin performance as core U.S. domestic operating margin came in at 10.2% vs. our estimate of 9.5% and the consensus 9.7% . For the 4Q, total revenues declined -3.2% YoYto $24.5bn, coming in above our estimate of $23.9bn (-5.5% YoY) and the consensus $24.0bn (-5.1% YoY). Notably, adj. operating profit of $2.89bnbn (11.8% margin) was nicely above our estimate of $2.63bn (11.0% margin) and the consensus $2.69bn (11.2% margin) as U.S. Domestic margin of 10.2% came in well ahead of our 9.5% estimate and the consensus 9.7%. As a result of the core adj. OP beat, adj. EPS of $2.38 was 8% above the consensus

$2.20 and 11% above our estimate of $2.14. So What Will the Stock Do?: With the combination of (1) a strong 4Q beat on better US ADV, RPP, and margin, (2) a stronger outlook on revenue in 2026, but (3) a somewhat softer / more conservative outlook on total operating margin for the year, we expect shares to open modestly higher . Overall, we're

pleased by the execution evident in the 4Q as U.S. margin expanded YoY despite the AMZN glide-down headwinds and fears of operating de-leverage. While we look to get additional segment-specific guidance on the call, our initial take is that UPS is executing well on the controllable and we continue to see a UPS post AMZN glide-down with better pricing, margin, and FCF. While likely overlooked, we're also pleased by the significantly reduced capital intensity in 2026, with capex expected to decline to $3.0bn vs. $3.7bn in 2025, unlocking FCF for shareholder returns activities (i.e. the dividend and buybacks).

· U.S. Domestic Package revenues declined -3.2% YoY to $16.8bn, coming in above our estimate of -6.2% and the consensus -5.9%, as ADV declined -10.8% YoY while RPP increased +8.3%. Segment adj. OM of 10.2% was above our 9.5% estimate and the consensus 9.7%. · International Package revenues grew 2.5% YoY to $5.0bn, also coming in above our estimate of +1.0% and the consensus +1.5%, as ADV declined -4.7% while RPP grew 7.1%. Segment adj. OM of 18.0% was above our estimate of 17.0% and the consensus 17.5%.

Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss.
