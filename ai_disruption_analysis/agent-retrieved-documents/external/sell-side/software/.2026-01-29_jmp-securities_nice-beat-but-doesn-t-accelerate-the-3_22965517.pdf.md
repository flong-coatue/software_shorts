Nice Beat but Doesn't Accelerate; the 3 Bear Cases; NOW at Citizens Tech Conference 3/2-3/3

· We maintain our Market Outperform rating and $260 price target on ServiceNow after the company reported better-than-expected 4Q25 results, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.92 (consensus $0.88), on revenue of $3.568B (consensus $3.528B), up 20.5% y/y as reported and 19.5% in constant currency (down from 22% as reported and 20.5% in cc last quarter); subscription revenue of $3.466B (consensus $3.424B), up 21% y/y as reported and 19.5% in cc (versus 21.5% as reported and 20.5% in cc last quarter); and most importantly, cRPO of $12.850B (consensus $12.571B), up 25% y/y as reported and 21% in cc, with Moveworks contributing ~100bps to cRPO leading to organic growth of 20% in cc, down from 20.5% last quarter, all of which left the stock down 5% in the aftermarket after having decreased 15% year to date versus an increase of 2% for the Russell 3000.

· Guidance was better than expected but did not quite represent acceleration with: 1) 1Q26 subscription revenue of $3.650B-$3.655B (consensus $3.575B), representing asreported growth of 21.5% (18.5%-19% cc versus 19.5% in 4Q), cRPO growth of 22.5% (20% cc) (consensus 19%), and operating margin of 31.5% (consensus 31%); 2) FY26 subscription revenue of $15.530B-$15.570B (consensus $15.213B), up 20.5%-21% as reported (consensus about 18%), up 19.5%-20% in constant currency (consensus about 17% in cc) and including about 100 basis points of acquired subscription revenue; and 3) FY26 operating margin of 32% (consensus 31.8%) and free cash flow margin of 36% (consensus 34.1%).

· We view ServiceNow as an attractive opportunity for long-term capital appreciation for several reasons, including: 1) we liked how CEO Bill McDermott directly addressed the bear cases including: a) that "AI will eat software companies," b) "seat compression," and c) is "M&A the new playbook out of necessity" ; 2) Now Assist ACV reached $600M, beating the prior comment of "on pace to exceed a half a billion in ACV this year" and should reach $1B in 2026; 3) we like the Armis deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2026, and how it "will solve the visibility problem" as the company "is already protecting over 40% of

the Fortune 100", and we believe ServiceNow has the ability to increase that number; 4) ServiceNow addresses a huge TAM that is now, according to Mr. McDermott, "beyond $600B" ; 5) ServiceNow has an attractive financial profile with 2026 revenue growth plus free cash flow margin expected to hit 57%, up from 55% in 2025; and 5) the company is ably led by veteran software CEO Bill McDermott, who just signed up for five more years in the role; President, CPO, and COO Amit Zavery; and President and CFO Gina Mastantuono.

· We increase our 2026 non-GAAP EPS estimate to $4.21 from $4.06 (consensus $4.10) on revenue growth of 20% y/y, increase our 2027 non-GAAP EPS estimate to $5.10 from $4.87 (consensus $4.92) on revenue growth of 21%, and introduce our 2028 nonGAAP EPS estimate of $6.14 on revenue growth of 20%. · ServiceNow trades at a 2027E EV/revenue multiple of 6.6x and a 2027E EV/FCF multiple of 18x, while our $260 price target implies a 2027E EV/revenue multiple of 13.6x and 2027E EV/FCF multiple of 37x, an ~10% premium to the peer group median EV/FCF

multiple that we believe is justified by the company's higher growth, strategic value, and the leadership of Bill McDermott and the rest of the executive team. - · ServiceNow will be participating in the Citizens Technology Conference held on March 2 & 3 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in San Francisco. Investors who would like to attend the conference should contact their Citizens institutional salesperson or this analyst.

McDermott addresses the bear case: Mr. McDermott used his prepared remarks to address the bear case on ServiceNow directly. That bear case includes three components: 1) AI is killing software.  'You need AI plus workflows because AI is probabilistic, which by definition means we can't be certain about the results. Workflow orchestration is deterministic, predictable, no randomness, which is required given the sophistication and governance of running global enterprises. AI doesn't replace enterprise orchestration. It depends on it. It depends on governance. It depends on scale.'  'The idea that these models are eating enterprise software may be true in some cases, but obviously, it's not true in our case. They're actually leaning into us because of the innovation on our platform.'

 As a helpful framework, we include Figure 1 below which illustrates how AI is changing enterprise software and identifies the nature of the solution, implementation, pricing, and support for on-premise, SaaS, and AI offerings. One key differentiator that we highlight is related to pricing, and more specifically, the seat-based model. This pricing model has played a key role in software for the past 20+ years; however, AI solutions are shifting to a success-based pricing model, prioritizing usage over seat count. We believe that companies making the AI transition need to move past the seat-based model, which we see ServiceNow doing with its hybrid pricing model.

|                    | AI                             | SaaS                          | On-Premise   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Nature of Solution | Hyper Personalized, Autonomous | Out of the Box, Best Practice | Customized   |
| Implementation     | Forward Deployed Engineers     | Systems Integrators           | Consultants  |
| Pricing            | Success Based                  | Subscription                  | License      |
| Support            | Fine-Tuning                    | Periodic Updates              | Maintenance  |

2) ServiceNow is experiencing seat compression.  'I continue to hear speculation about seat compression. If all we did was look at available seats in our target market, there would be an estimated 1.3 billion seats in that target market, so we'd barely scratch the surface. Of course, we're looking far beyond seats alone with our hybrid business model for billions of devices, agents, and assists.' 3) M&A is the new playbook out of necessity, to which Mr. McDermott stated four things:  'ServiceNow is fully capable of achieving previously stated subscription revenue and Now Assist ACV targets without M&A.'  'We have never acquired a single company for revenue alone.'  'ServiceNow's organic growth strategy with opportunistic tuck-ins for tech and talent remains unchanged.'  'Post Armis, we do not see any other large white spaces that are necessary to complete our platform vision for security.' Figure 2 below shows that five factors sets ServiceNow apart.

Source: ServiceNow Anthropic and OpenAI Partnerships: During the call, Mr. McDermott announced two partnerships, one with Anthropic and one with OpenAI. ServiceNow is using Anthropic's Claude as 'the default model powering ServiceNow Build Agent,' which helps developers 'build and deploy agentic workflows.' Internally, the company 'deploys Claude and Claude Code to more than 29,000 employees.' Additionally, on the call, Mr. Zavery commented, 'we use Claude as the underlying technology to generate some of the code, and then we provide the context, the security, the governance on top of that, using build agent to run those workflows on top of ServiceNow.'

Regarding ServiceNow's OpenAI partnership, Mr. McDermott commented, 'OpenAI models will be a preferred intelligence capability for several agentic use cases offered to ServiceNow enterprise customers.' With Mr. Zavery adding, 'what we're doing around voice AI and speech-to-speech, real-time, multimodal, as well as multilingual capabilities. So our CRM products can now have voice capabilities with OpenAI as, as a preferred model, so that we can have a much more differentiated offering using what we know from domains perspective as well as context, and adding the OpenAI speech capabilities into our products.' Acquisitions: Regarding ServiceNow's acquisitions, which include Moveworks, Veza, and Armis, Mr. McDermott stated the following.

 Moveworks ($2.85B) : The Moveworks acquisition was announced on March 10, 2025, and closed on December 15, 2025. As a reminder, Moveworks provides an AI assistant to help resolve employee requests and automate workplace support. On the call, Mr. McDermott commented, 'Contribution from Moveworks was de minimis. Our CRPO growth was 25%, 21% in constant currency… including a 1% contribution from Moveworks.'  Veza (undisclosed amount) : The Veza acquisition was announced on December 2, 2025, and has not closed yet. As a reminder, Veza is an identity security platform that maps and manages permissions across human, machine, and AI identities throughout an organization. On the call, Mr. McDermott commented, "Veza will solve the identity governance problem through its patented Access Graph technology. Veza maps access relationships and privileges across humans, machines, and AI agents in real time. This is critical because AI agents need dynamic, context-aware permissions. An agent working for a senior

manager needs different access than the same agent working for a junior employee, and those permissions must be governed continuously, not set once and forgotten."

-  Armis ($7.75B): The Armis acquisition was announced on December 23, 2025 and is expected to close in the 'early second half of this year.' As a reminder, Armis is a cyber-physical security platform that provides visibility across IT, OT, IoT, and medical devices. On the call, Mr. McDermott commented, 'Armis will solve the visibility problem. Armis provides real-time agentless discovery and classification of every asset across the entire enterprise: IT, OT, IoT, medical devices, industrial controllers, and even shadow IT that bypasses procurement.' He also said, 'Post Armis, we do not see any other large white spaces that are necessary to complete our platform vision for security.' Ms. Mastantuono commented, 'We expect to close Armis at this point, second half, early second half of this year… we expect subscription revenue contribution to be about a point… We expect potentially up to maybe 50 basis points on headwind to operating margin in 2026, up to 50.'

On M&A, Mr. McDermott commented, 'We use M&A to expand into an even larger TAM, and it is now beyond $600 billion, based entirely on where our customers need us to go, where we know we can build exciting growth businesses.'

Why the stock is down: We note that in the aftermarket, ServiceNow stock is down ~5%. To explain this, we point to three things. First, the company reported subscription revenue of $3.466B, growth of 21% as-reported (19.5% cc), a deceleration from 22% as-reported (20.5% cc) growth last quarter. Additionally, we note that the 2026 guide subscription revenue growth of 20.5%-21% as reported (19.5%-20% cc) includes a 100bps contribution from the acquisition of Moveworks, meaning the organic subscription revenue growth guide for 2026 is 18.5%-19% cc versus consensus growth of 18.5%, which could also be a factor pressuring the stock. Second, the company reported cRPO growth of 25% (21% cc), from 21% as-reported (20.5% cc) last quarter. Although it seems like a slight acceleration from 3Q to 4Q, we note that the 4Q cRPO number includes

a 100bps cRPO contribution from the acquisition of Moveworks, meaning that organic cRPO growth was 20%, a slight deceleration from last quarter. Third, we note that ServiceNow reported 4Q gross margins of 80.3%, which was below the consensus of 81.0%. Renewal rate: We note that this quarter, ServiceNow experienced a 1% increase in renewal rate to 98% from 97% last quarter. Figure 3 below shows ServiceNow's renewal rate from 4Q24 to 4Q25. FIGURE 3. ServiceNow Renewal Rate (3Q24-3Q25) Source: ServiceNow Balance sheet: As of F4Q25 end, ServiceNow had ~$10.1B in cash and ~$1.5B in debt equating to a net cash position of ~$8.6B. The debt is made up of 1.40% fixed-rate 10-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on September 1, 2030.

Total revenue of $3.568B, up 21% y/y (20% cc), was above the consensus of $3.528B, up 19% y/y, and our former estimate of $3.535B, up 20% y/y. Subscription revenue of $3.466B, up 21% y/y (20% cc), was above the consensus of $3.424B, up 20%, and our former estimate of 3.426B, up 20%. Professional services and other revenue of $102M, up 12% (11% cc) y/y, was above the consensus of $100M, up 10% y/y, and below our former estimate of $109M, up 20% y/y. Non-GAAP gross margin of 80.3% was below the consensus of 81.0% and our former estimate of 81.1%. NonGAAP operating margin of 30.9% was above the consensus of 30.2% and our former estimate of 30.0%. NonGAAP EPS of $0.92 was above the consensus of $0.88 and above our estimate of $0.89.

Operating cash flow of $2.238B was above the consensus of $2.150B and our estimate of $2.141B, and free cash flow of $2.032 was above the consensus of $1.911B and our estimate of $1.929B. Calculated billings of $5.540B, up 28% y/y, was above the consensus of $5.212B, up 20% and our estimate of $5.135B, up 18% y/y. RPO of $28.2B, up 27% y/y (23% cc), was above the consensus of $27.7B, up 24%, and our estimate of $27.5B, up 24% y/y. cRPO of ~$12.9B, up 25% y/y (21% cc), was above the consensus and our estimate of $12.6B, up 23% y/y. Figure 4 below shows ServiceNow's financial highlights from 4Q25.

ServiceNow guided to subscription revenue of $3.650B-$3.655B, up 21.5% y/y as reported and 18.5%-19% in constant currency, versus the consensus of $3.575B, up 19% y/y, and our former estimate of $3.561B, up 19% y/y. ServiceNow guided to cRPO growth of 22.5% (20% cc), versus the consensus of 19% and our prior estimate of 23%. Management guided to a non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5%, versus the consensus of 31% and our estimate of 32%. The company guided to a weighted average share count of 1.05B.

ServiceNow guided to subscription revenue of $15.530B-$15.570B, up 20.5%-21% as reported (19.5%-20% cc) versus the consensus of $15.213B, up 19% as reported. Management also guided to a non-GAAP subscription gross margin of 82%, non-GAAP operating margin of 32% versus the consensus of 31.8%, and free cash flow margin of 36% versus the consensus of 34%. The company guided to an average share count of 1.05B. Figure 5 below shows some of ServiceNow's guidance assumptions.

RPO and cRPO (F4Q24-F4Q25) Source: ServiceNow Gartner Magic Quadrant for Business Orchestration and Automation: On October 15, 2025, Gartner named ServiceNow a Leader for its Business Orchestration and Automation Technologies. Gartner highlighted ServiceNow's 'BOAT platform and scalability,' which is the company's ability to unify 'orchestration, RPA, AI, and workflows on a single platform with native data and governance.' Additional strengths according to Gartner include the company's 'multiagent orchestration and openness,' and the company's 'governance and observability.'

As shown in the image below, ServiceNow has stayed in the same position from 2024 to 2025 while Salesforce (CRM, MO, $405 PT) has remained a strong leader in the space in both years. However, Gartner views ServiceNow's strengths as the AI driven workflow vision, a unified platform, and the partner network. Gartner says cautions regarding ServiceNow's CRM include breadth (such as no marketing functionalities), analytics breadth (no unified view across Sales Service and Field Services), and deployment complexity (with a UI, particularly for agents, that is less intuitive and feature rich).

Gartner notes that some of ServiceNow's strengths include its 'ITSM market presence,' its 'strategic product vision,' and its 'tangible agentic functionality.' Gartner notes some of its weaknesses include its lack of a free trial, its 'complex search configuration,' and its 'ITSM LLM focus.'

Microsoft (MSFT, NC) reported its F2Q26 results yesterday with Microsoft Cloud passing $50B in revenue, up 24% y/y in constant currency, a slight deceleration from 25% last quarter. CEO Satya Nadella commented that 'we are in the beginning phases of AI diffusion and its broad GDP impact.' Azure revenue grew 38% cc, down slightly from 39% last quarter. The company guided to Azure growth of 37%-38% cc versus the consensus of 37.1%. The stock dropped 6% in the aftermarket as some investors were hoping for Azure acceleration. The company also continues to invest heavily. Capex was a record $37.5B, up from $34.9B last quarter, and up from $22.6B a year ago. Looking forward, Microsoft expects its capex in 3Q to decrease sequentially.

Software was disappointing in 2025 and started the same way in 2026 with our coverage universe down 8% YTD. Although the public markets have been difficult in this sector, we point to a quote from one of the VCs that we recently spoke to that summarizes the current condition of software and AI. They said, 'Overall, the AI native companies are beating their plans. The older companies have reset their plans to lower growth rates and are beating those plans, but they are not exciting.' To demonstrate this, in Figure 14 below, we show a list of 15 private AI companies where we have found a publicly disclosed ARR.

ServiceNow provides an intelligent workflow automation platform for digital business with embedded AI and machine leraning capabilities. The company's applications are organized in four primary areas: Technology, Customer, Employee and Creator. ServiceNow has more than 8,000 customers.

ServiceNow participates in intensely competitive markets, and if it does not compete effectively, its business and operating results will be harmed. Doing business with the public sector, including U.S. governments and agencies, heavily-regulated organizations and governments globally, subjects ServiceNow to risks related to government procurement processes, regulations, and contracting requirements. If ServiceNow is unsuccessful in increasing its penetration of international markets or managing the risks associated with foreign markets, its business and operating results will be adversely affected. If ServiceNow fails to innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and customer needs, its business prospects may be harmed. If ServiceNow loses key members of its management team, including CEO and Chairman Bill McDermott, its business may be adversely affected.
