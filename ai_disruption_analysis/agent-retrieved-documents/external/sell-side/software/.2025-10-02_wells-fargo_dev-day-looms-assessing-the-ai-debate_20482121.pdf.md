Industry Update - October 2, 2025

Remain constructive software amid the AI buildout, favoring infra layer for now. Despite an overly bearish narrative on apps further fueled by OpenAI's recent blitz (& upcoming DevDay), incumbents aren't just rolling over-green shoots are emerging. Rising tide lifts all boats = stay +ve infra software: We've observed dramatic demand upticks across cloud/AI infra, w/ benefits accruing to vendors provisioning capacity/tools to AI labs/builders (CSPs, neoclouds, tooling, data). These market shifts are now resulting in infra software again commanding a premium to apps, which we expect continues ROY. Key vendors fueling this shift incl CRWV & MSFT , where we highlight our CRWV u/g & upwd MSFT est revisions + recent launches on DDOG & MDB.

Unpacking bear narrative across app software: We see the current debates in apps divided into 3 camps: 1) displacement by AI Labs, i.e. OpenAI on 9/30 previewing its own software apps, despite existing OpenAI/Anthropic usage of key SaaS platforms (ORCL, CRM, WDAY, FIG, SNOW, TEAM, DOCU), 2) commoditization of code development (i.e. "vibe coding"), rendering existing apps less differentiated & 3) ongoing seat debate (i.e. productivity gains = fewer FTEs). We explore each in detail in this report.

However, we see green shoots emerging at app layer, though still est. sub-$10B total today (<1/5 size of AI infra software): Based on our mapping of rev contribs in software to-date, we est MSFT leads in AI adoption w/ ~$2.5B Copilot ARR, followed by privatelyheld Databricks at ~$1B & Cursor ~$0.5B. While others are still near the $100M-350M ARR range (inc. most of app software NOW CRM WDAY , , , etc.), we highlight ADBE 's emerging ecosystem approach as a perhaps more credible strategy to watch.

Sharp decline in token costs proving out model layer commoditization, likely leading value to accrue at software layer: Using MSFT's disclosures around token consumption, we see unit prices deteriorating as compute consumption explodes (>500T tokens consumed in FY25, up 7x y/y). Triangulating w/ other data points (see analysis inside) suggests a sharp decline in token costs each qtr, aligning w/ release of new models and, in our view, eventually benefiting the apps embedding AI functionality. Software's not dead, just evolving: Though clearly disruptive, foundation models don't displace software. Instead, expect 1) pricing models evolve, favoring consumption (+ unrestricting the growth algo), 2) discrete monetization remains difficult, but bundled AI becomes new premium tier/another growth lever, & 3) software embeds the best functionality from foundation models w/o the burden of training costs. Expect '26 & '27 begins greater growth contribs across space-w/ margins largely intact.

1. Play the infrastructure build: We're most constructive today on the current build cycle that is driving material upticks in infrastructure software and see this as the most direct way to currently play the AI trend. Within our coverage, we highlight MSFT & CRWV as the key beneficiaries of this market development, largely driven by AI-optimized IaaS revenue (i.e., GPUs, XPUs). This likely shifts "up-the-stack" over time towards PaaS layer and eventually SaaS layer as these infrastructure vendors take early AI market/mind share. We expect that monetization is still in early innings given the sharp increases in capex that are still occurring (monetization should naturally ramp in the qts subsequent to material upticks in capex). Additionally, we think vendors like MDB and DDOG could offer another credible vector of spend capture in infrastructure, bridging infra and app software/agentic deployments.

2. Play the embedded software/platform trend: While not necessarily driving discrete $ "AI sales", we think AI boosts the differentiation discussion of those embedded software players who can effectively add AI functionality to their offerings, potentially improving the durability of growth via tier upgrades, free-to-paid conversion, and potential add-ons/cross-sells. We view key platform stories like NOW INTU, , and ADBE likely winners from this AI shift, using the incremental functionality as a carrot for customers to upgrade to higher tiers with better features. Of note, many of these names have seen relative underperformance over the past yr, presenting more compelling multiples based on growth profile. While still forming (more coming at MAX), ADBE's new Creative Cloud Pro bundle provides access to proprietary first-party models & popular thirdparty image/video models (e.g., nano-banana) used not only for ideation workflows (e.g., textto-image) but also for generative features inside Adobe's product portfolio (e.g.,

Generative Fill in Photoshop). We believe this can extend Adobe's entrenchment in creatives by centralizing access to models, making third-party models more cost-effective (often cheaper to access via Adobe than directly through the model provider), and by swallowing yet another creative workflow (ideation).

3. Pick your spots on SEO debate + new era of AI assistants could shift top-of-funnel activity (+ve MarTech vendors?): One thing that has begun to materialize in earnest is the shift in SEO trends as AI-enabled search has proliferated (i.e., ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Gemini), sparked by commentary from Monday.com on an earnings call earlier this year. Vendors with an SMB or mass-market audience (i.e., consumer) will naturally have greater exposure to search engine optimization (SEO), likely meaning these vendors will need to adapt to a new top-of-funnel that includes search traffic from AI. While vendors with more exposure to SEO (like DOCU or HUBS ) have not called out material impacts yet, we think this shift may be one to watch. We also highlight that vendors facilitating this shift on marketing side (i.e., BRZE ADBE , , or HUBS in midmarket) could be set to benefit as MarTech evolves.

4. Pick the players powering the new giants: OpenAI and Anthropic are likely to become two of the largest companies on the planet over the next few years, in particular with revenue expectations for OpenAI estimated to climb to $200 billion in 2030. As of 2024, fewer than 50 companies globally have ever reached $200B+ revenue scale. While fears continue that OpenAI will internally develop its own software stack, we think it's more likely that this will drive significant need for 3p software applications to manage a business of this scale, particularly on the business sideCRM, HCM, ERP, productivity, etc. We expect much of its business application needs are supplied by ORCL (Fusion) WDAY , , and CRM today. We note that customers such as CosmosDB/ MSFT , Slack/ CRM , Anaplan, Linear, and others have called out OpenAI as a customer. Sifting through the careers page at OpenAI suggests it currently uses Oracle Fusion (ERP, O2C/P2P), Salesforce (CRM, Slack), Workday,

Figma, Snowflake, Airtable, and Workato. Anthropic's website shows job postings w/ direct mentions of Oracle Netsuite, Workday, Salesforce, Atlassian (Jira), and DocuSign.

Exhibit 1 - 2025 YTD Returns: App Software Significantly Lagging Broader Indices, Infrastructure, & Security Source: Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Factset Note: YTD pricing as of close on 10/2. CRWV returns since IPO on March 28

Early Traction in Infrastructure Software Driving Significant Share Outperformance: To-date, the most significant spending observed around generative AI has been at the infrastructure layer, particularly for spend on GPU-based compute infrastructure as a service (IaaS). This has primarily come in the form of spend for training of LLMs and inference of newer AI applications and has been particularly concentrated from just a few customers-namely those building models such as OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Meta, among a few others. Other key buyers of this compute have been sovereign entities, and to a lesser extent, large enterprises. To date, those who are most directly benefiting from this new wave of AI primarily include 1) the AI labs who are developing the foundation models for key use cases (general productivity/search - ChatGPT/OpenAI, coding - Claude/Anthropic, etc.) and 2) the providers of the raw compute-namely the hyperscalers, cloud service providers/CSPs, and neoclouds (those provisioning GPUs

for rental access). As a result, shares of key providers such as ORCL, NBIS, and CRWV have all significantly outperformed vs NASDAQ, +73%, +354%, +245% vs NASDAQ +18% YTD. Lesser Impact in Apps Thus Far; Shares Have Also Underperformed: Conversely, app software vendors have yet to see significant AI tailwinds/adoption so far in the build cycle, largely correlating with lagging share performance so far this year. The share performance is also likely attributable to other core debates within software, particularly pressures on seat-based models. While the spending on inferencing-i.e., running AI applications, or running compute against existing models-has yet to emerge outside of a few key applications, the magnitude of spend at the AI training layer suggests downstream inference usage could be significant over time. Key application software vendors like CRM, WDAY, ADBE, NOW, HUBS, & TEAM have all seen negative returns this year. Exhibit 2 - Mapping Discrete AI Monetization by Individual Category

AI Demand Remains Well Above Current Supply: Beyond NVIDIA, the hyperscalers remain the best barometer of underlying AI compute/services demand, in our view, given their scale, significant existing customer relationships, and scope/breadth of offerings. These platforms offer the underlying compute capacity helping to power the AI labs developing foundation models. In recent quarters, each of the cloud service providers has cited AI demand patterns outpacing available GPU capacity, extending a nearly two-year narrative of supply chain shortages (original shortage comments began to surface in early 2024). Further, Microsoft and Google have each stated that they expect supply-demand imbalances to persist through the remainder of 2025 (not likely easing until sometime in early-2026), while Amazon noted it will take "several quarters" (not likely easing until sometime in mid-2026), each suggesting the lack of supply will limit growth in the interim. While power has been noted as the primary factor, other considerations have also

included slower rollouts of new generations/families of chips (i.e., NVDA Blackwell) and associated equipment (networking, racks, other components). Monetization Skewing Towards AI Labs, CSPs Today: As mentioned, the most evidence of AI monetization has come from direct builders of the technology, not yet yielding downstream impacts of significance. As such, the primary monetization drivers beyond the chips enabling the buildout (i.e., GPUs, XPUs and associated networking/data center/equipment) are at the infrastructure layer, where cloud/AI service providers are making the chips available as a rental/service, and the model layer, where AI Labs are building large language models that can perform increasingly difficult tasks. Up the stack, where customers are not necessarily supplying the infrastructure to AI Labs or building their own models, monetization has proven more limited to date. Exhibit 5 - AI Build Cycle Still Materializing in Lower Levels of the Stack

Microsoft's AI Monetization & Revenue Contribution Leads All Infra, Software Vendors Today, Reflecting Prescient View of AI: MSFT's early investment in OpenAI and associated revenue share/ IP access has ultimately led to its significant share gains in the cloud and AI market. The company was first to market with various products built around OpenAI's IP and has already built a significant business on top of its Azure AI offerings, including Azure OpenAI Service, Azure Foundry, etc. as well as leading market position in the application layer with Copilot (including GitHub Copilot, M365 Copilot, etc.). As a result, MSFT is a clear early winner of the AI race, supported by accelerating growth in Azure revenues and significant bookings activity that has emerged over the last 8 quarters. While MSFT's contract negotiations with OpenAI continue, we expect any finalized agreement between the two companies to likely represent a net positive benefit for MSFT.

Microsoft Sharply Expanding Third-Party Capacity to Meet Demand: Microsoft has been significantly expanding its capacity from third-party compute partners/providers, a clear indication of increasing AI demand beyond OpenAI. In recent weeks, Microsoft has announced capacity arrangements with neocloud Nebius for $17.4B in initial compute over a 5-year term (with an expansion option of up to $19.4B) as well as multiple contracts with neocloud Nscale in Europe, including a $6.2B contract in Norway and another undisclosed magnitude contract in the UK for a 23K GB300 cluster (which we estimate will likely cost $0.5-1.0B per year). These announcements follow CoreWeave's disclosure of Microsoft expanding during the early weeks of calendar 3Q. We believe Microsoft is aggressively subcontracting compute to third parties in an attempt to keep its AI business from moving to other partners directly. We believe its strategic decision not to fund OpenAI's largest contracts may also be a result of this outsized demand /

shortage of supply.

CoreWeave Significant Beneficiary of Current Buildout, Now >$50B in Committed Customer Spend: CoreWeave represents another key player in the buildout of broader AI technology, specifically powering broader GPU capacity for the AI labs and the hyperscalers. This has been evidenced by many significant deals over the last several weeks, with demand sharply outpacing any prior expectations for the company. As outlined in our upgrade last week, the litany of recent deals underscore the evidence of massive AI demand forming in the market more broadly. Its latest (and largest) announcement to date came this week with Meta (dated Sep 25) and includes a $14.2B contract over 6 years and follows CoreWeave's recent deals with NVIDIA on Sep 9 ($6.3B for unsold capacity) and OpenAI on Sep 23 ($6.5B for additional compute). While CRWV did not disclose the amount incremental to NVDA's existing contact, prior reports suggested its earlier contract was $1.3B,

suggesting a $5B expansion to $6.3B. In total, CoreWeave has now reached >$50B in total contracted spend from customers, perhaps one of the fastest ramps to ever hit software. Exhibit 6 - Model Context Protocol (MCP) Monthly Downloads

Source: PyPI and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC MCP is how AI agents connect with data and applications like Gmail MongoDB and Datadog are key gears in the AI infrastructure engine. MongoDB and Datadog provide vital solutions for agentic deployments. MongoDB is the NoSQL database of choice for AInatives as it provides a unified, anti-fragmentation solution through its NoSQL database, vector embeddings + vector search, and metadata management. Datadog is already benefiting from the AI application build cycle, with ARR from AI customers approaching $300 mil, making it the earliest and largest beneficiaries of AI to-date. We believe that enterprises will lean on existing technology and observability stack to support these novel use cases. Datadog provides highly rated AI-oriented products such as GPU monitoring and LLM observability, which allow developers to maximize resources and minimize agentic deviations away from the intended workflows.

Model Costs Getting Cheaper as Performance Improves: As AI model performance continues to improve, the cost relative to throughput from these models is rapidly decreasing. This trend is largely driven by advancements in model efficiency (i.e., better architectures, optimized training techniques). At the same time, benchmark scores across tasks like language understanding, image recognition, and code generation are rising, indicating that models are becoming more capable even as their resource demands shrink. For example, we would call out the improvement from GPT-4 to GPT-5, where the latter performed better across all metrics on the LMArena test (a commonly referenced AI benchmarking score). More qualitatively, we've picked up significantly reduced costs for software vendors that are deploying these technologies across their offerings, including Atlassian mentioning 3 orders of magnitude improvement in costs for its Rovo AI product.

Evolution of Models Means Eventual Commoditization: As model benchmarking scores continue to rise across the board, the gap in performance between leading frontier models is narrowing. However, we believe the edge in each model will be unique strengths specifically optimized for certain use cases (i.e., code vs. web browsing). This trend points toward a future where the underlying model becomes less of a differentiator, and more of a commodity. In such an environment, value will shift toward areas like data quality, application performance, and user experience. We often believe history is a good place to look, and similar to the era of cloud which evolved from a competitive edge dynamic to a commodity, we believe foundational models are on a similar trajectory, with differentiation emerging further up the stack.

Microsoft Token Analysis Showing Early Signs of Costs Per Token Decreasing: Leveraging Microsoft's stated data points on token consumption compared with our estimates of Azure AI (including Azure Foundry, Azure OpenAI Service, etc.), we attempted to size the effective cost per 1M tokens over time. Specifically, MSFT's disclosures included >100T were consumed in 3Q'25, growing 5x y/y and 500T tokens were consumed in FY25, up 7x y/y. Triangulating other data points based on this (see below), the analysis indicates a decline in token costs every quarter, which aligns directionally with the release cadence of newer frontier models. We note that the actual cost per token varies greatly based on model and individual query, and therefore these are more helpful from a directional perspective.

GitHub Another Case Study of Commoditization Approaching: Mirroring the pattern from the model vendors themselves, the recent GitHub announcement regarding the deprecation of several third-party Copilot models including models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google signifies another step in the commoditization of foundational AI models as new ones are released. As model performance continues to converge across different benchmarks, the marginal gains between toptier models are shrinking, while costs to train and deploy them are falling due to architectural and efficiency improvements. In this environment, GitHub's move reflects a broader industry trend: the underlying model is no longer the primary differentiator. Instead, we believe the value is beginning to shift up the stack specifically toward the app layer (i.e., Copilot). Specifically, much like the shift from on-premise systems to the cloud, where compute became a commodity and differentiation moved to services and tooling, we see initial signs that foundational models are now entering

a similar phase. Exhibit 8 - GitHub 10/23 Model Deprecation List Source: Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Company reports Thinking Machines Labs Tinker Product Another Sign of Commoditization: Ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati's startup Thinking Machine Labs announced a new product this week reflecting a broader trend in model commoditization. By simplifying the process of fine-tuning large language models through a standardized API and infrastructure, Tinker lowers the barrier to entry for customizing openweight models. This shift suggests that the technical complexity once associated with model training is increasingly getting lower. As tools like Tinker become more prevalent, the competitive edge in AI is moving away from owning proprietary models toward how effectively one can adapt and deploy existing ones for specific tasks. Specifically, we believe this points to a maturing ecosystem where model customization is becoming a routine capability rather than a specialized skill.

Model Commoditization Could Prove Significant Benefit to Software: While new models continue to improve upon each successive release, we think this actually results in a net benefit to software vendors. Of note, we've observed software vendors able to absorb the costs of AI more easily in models (i.e., TEAM removing paid tier for AI offerings and embedding functionality for free) particularly driven by the rise of open source models that can enable this technology for a fraction of the cost. We expect that as models increasingly drive throughput/intelligence higher per unit of cost (as well as improvements in hardware), software is likely to increasingly benefit as it will prove able to embed the incremental functionality without any of the burden of training the foundation models.

Infra: CFLT, DDOG, DOCN, DT, ESTC, MDB, MSFT, ORCL, SNOW, TWLO Hesitation in rotating towards application software (and contributing to the valuation gap between apps and infra) is driven by the looming threat of AI disruption. Three key arguments underpin this concern: (1) AI-native startups flush with funding will invade incumbents' turf; (2) AI-driven code generation will lower barriers to building software in-house, diminishing demand for off-the-shelf SaaS; and (3) seat-based pricing models (a backbone of SaaS growth algorithm) are misaligned to AI's value proposition (do more with less), necessitating an evolution (and likely bumpy transition period).

However, a closer look-informed by historical tech shifts (on-prem to cloud) and current evidence -shows these fears can and should be tempered. Incumbents are not helpless; those who adapt can not only defend their territory but reap the benefits of a major tech shift in the coming years.

The Fear : AI startups are seeing massive capital inflows and the innovator's dilemma says incumbents will prove slow to adapt to the new technology shift. Model providers, like OpenAI and Anthropic, have signaled intentions to move up the stack into end-user applications. Separately, there is a wave of independent AI agentic applications solving specific use cases that are emerging (e.g., coding, customer service, enterprise search). The primary concern is incumbents will prove too slow to move, resulting in incremental value accruing to more nimble AI-natives with nothing to lose.

Counterpoint : Today there is limited evidence of incumbents being displaced by AI startups. AInatives are arguably seeing a disproportionate share of new dollars, though that is incremental to not a replacement for incumbent system of records; incumbent platforms are not being rendered obsolete. Importantly, AI dollars flowing to applications have been quite small (relative to infrastructure). As such, incumbents have ample time to craft a response to startups and hold meaningful advantages to build on (distribution, contextual data, integration into existing owned workflows). Stitching it altogether, we resist the urge to make a David-Goliath reference and instead argue that AI will continue to prove positive-sum with incumbents eventually gaining a fair share of the pie.

Cloud was positive-sum-it wasn't a straight-line but many of the largest software vendors today are on-prem incumbents that were eventually able to adapt (ADBE, ADSK, INTU, MSFT, ORCL, SAP). It's important not to understate the disruption cloud caused on-prem incumbents (i.e., there is definitely risk) yet we believe application vendors are being unfairly punished by the market and painted with too broad a brush. Below are examples of on-prem incumbents and new cloud entrants across various popular software application markets.

the rise of cloud (MSFT, ORCL, SAP, ADBE, INTU, ADSK with honorable mentions for ADP, CSCO, IBM given hardware/services-related exposure), surviving through a combination of organic and inorganic innovation. Microsoft's revenue scale has grown by 7.5x in the past 20 years, from ~$40Bn to nearly $300Bn. If you bought shares of MSFT in 2005 and held until today, your return (ex dividends) would be 2700% or an 18% compounded rate. The remaining four were new entrants via cloud: Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, and Atlassian (with honorable mentions for AWS and GCP, among hundreds of smaller but still scaled companies). Exhibit 12 - Cumulative Net New Revenue Since 2003, Incumbents vs. New Entrants in Software Source: Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and company reports

In the cloud era, CRM market proved most susceptible to disruption-could history repeat itself? : Salesforce, ServiceNow & Workday were the new entrant success stories in the cloud era (in addition to AWS, Snowflake, etc.) and well-known for having disrupted Siebel (acquired by Oracle), BMC (taken private) & SuccessFactors (acquired by SAP) / PeopleSoft (acquired by Oracle), respectively. There were also plenty of new software markets created or reinvented by cloud, such as DevOps/ collaboration (vis-a-vis Atlassian, Slack, etc.). Today, the major application software market with the highest penetration of cloud is CRM at 88%, followed by ERP at 67%. Going one layer deeper, every segment of the CRM market (sales, marketing, customer service, commerce, cross-CRM) is >85% penetrated by cloud . Meanwhile, only one ERP segment is >70% cloud-HCM-where Workday made its splash; other application

markets, like financial mgmt, supply chain mkt, productivity suites, etc., proved more difficult to upend, leaving incumbents with ample time to position themselves accordingly. SAP, despite being very late to cloud, is not only still around but has tripled its revenue since the cloud era began and is now very competitive with a strong cloud platform. The CRM market is also the largest opportunity by revenue/profit in software making it an enticing opp for AI. , And besides the already strong product-market fit of genAI in developer tooling (a la code generation), customer/IT service/help desk has shown early signs of proving the next key use case to achieve product-market fit given the pot'l for meaningful ROI, realized via labor arbitrage. Hence, we continue to view vendors tied to customer service as most at-risk of AI disruption as outlined in previous reports ( see our report "Competitive Intensity Rising Across CRM as GenAI Disruption Advances").

· OpenAI showcasing what's possible via internally developed tools, leading front-office to trade down: This week OpenAI released a series highlighting internally developed software (leveraging AI), including GTM assistant (tool for sales reps to automate customer research & preperation), an inbound sales assistant (handles inbound leads), a contract data agent (streamlines the contract review process), and support agents. The market reaction was stark, with front-office names trading down significantly (HUBS/KVYO/DOCU were down 10%/12%/12% vs. the IGV down 1%). While these tools explore the art of what's possible and build on the T-mobile case study (T-mobile signed a notable contract with OpenAI to partner on developing a bespoke customer support solution), they are still only internally developed tools (nothing to suggest OpenAI plans to sell these solutions to external customers, at least not yet) and OpenAI's engineering talent is one of one i.e., it would be incredibly hard for companies not named OpenAI, let alone SMBs, to similarly build

bespoke solutions in-house using off the shelf models. · Sora 2 Makes a Splash in Creative: OpenAI released Sora 2 this week, highlighting "we are jumping straight to what we think may be the GPT-3.5 moment for video". Key enhancements include improved physical realism and coherence (emphasizes more accurate physics, better motion, and fewer "glitches") as well as enhanced safety, control, and attribution measures. Alongside Sora 2, OpenAI is rolling out a companion social media app comparable to TikTok for AI video (currently invite-only in US & Canada). This follows Google's popular image gen model, Gemini-2.5 Flash (aka nano banana), a month ago. We believe Adobe's decision to more actively advertise third-party model support means the company stands to benefit from these recent improvements.

· OpenAI Job Platform: In early Sept, OpenAI announced a Job Platform designed to leverage AI to match company needs with employee skills, and develop employees (not too different from the original LinkedIn). In the press release, OpenAI mentioned it's working with large enterprises on the offering, including Walmart, John Deere, BCG, Accenture, and Indeed. The platform will include Certifications leveraging OpenAI Academy, a free online learning platform dedicated to upskilling around AI tools. The company stated the goal to certify 10M people by 2030. We would also point out ChatGPT's study mode, dedicated to learning new topics. We think this screens as more of a social platform or marketplace, rather than B2B software, though it's worth keeping an eye on how it takes shape from here.

· Developer/IT workflows remain the only AI use case with meaningful new entrant monetization: Looking at Exhibit 2, the majority of private vendors with agents >$100Mn in ARR are associated with developer tooling (Cursor, Cognition & Replit), vibe coding (Vercel, Lovable, 70%+ Cloud Penetration 50-69% Cloud Penetration Bolt.new) or broader IT (MoveWorks). Also, the model providers have outwardly focused on developing specialized models that excel at coding, like Claude Code.

The Fear: GenAI lowers the barrier to building software via code generation, "prompt-to-code", and no-code/low-code AI tools. Therefore, companies could increasingly choose to build custom applications in-house instead of buying out-of-the-box SaaS. This raises the specter of a widespread DIY movement, where even non-engineers can spin up tailored applications, shifting the classic buyvs.-build calculus more in favor of build and potentially undermining growth for SaaS vendors.

Counterpoint : It's true that AI is making software development faster and more accessible, but that doesn't spell the end of SaaS. Historically, many businesses could build software in-house but chose not to except in areas of strategic differentiation. AI doesn't magically transform every company into a software company (despite popular belief)-it still takes time, talent and money to develop, secure, maintain and operate software at scale. GenAI accelerates coding (what used to take months might take weeks), yet building a robust application entails much more than automating code... design, testing, data management, integrations with other systems, security, compliance, ongoing updates, user support-all these necessities don't disappear. For most enterprises, the value proposition of SaaS (turnkey solutions, vendor support, ongoing maintenance, reliability) remains compelling, especially for standard business functions. In short, AI may enable prototypes for free, but scaling and maintaining a production-grade application will continue to tilt the buy-vs.-build scale in favor of buy, in our

view. Not every business will reinvent the wheel, even if AI theoretically makes it easier, though it will push SaaS vendors to prove out their value proposition. Companies might build an AI-driven analytics module unique to their proprietary data, but they're unlikely to custom-build every generic tool, like a CRM, ERP, productivity suite, etc. from scratch when mature SaaS options exist. AI can help companies fill gaps with small internal apps and scripts, but that often builds off of or complements an existing SaaS stack. During the on-prem to cloud transition some companies considered hosting or building their own solutions too but ultimately convenience and speed of innovation won out in most areas (where we actually saw a more marked shift towards OOTB from DIY). Likewise, if SaaS vendors rapidly infuse leading-edge models, that could itself prove valuable enough to discourage organizations from building in-house.

The Fear : Application software has long been married to seat-based pricing models. As companies hire more people, they need more licenses-a dynamic conveniently linked to non-farm employment growth (which has seen a steady uptrend historically). However, if AI enables businesses to operate with fewer employees, or at least slows down headcount expansion, it undercuts a core component of the SaaS growth algorithm. In a more extreme scenario, AI agents could replace human workers in certain roles or automate entire workflows, completely upending seat-based models and making the value of software no longer correlated to the # of users. Ultimately, the fear is that incumbents wedded to seat-based economics will see stagnation or contraction, unless they overhaul their pricing models which could prove inherently risky and difficult.

Counterpoint : Seat-based pricing is not dead but it will need to evolve. Monthly subscriptions priced on a per-user basis was effectively a new model that replaced perpetual on-premise licenses during the rise of cloud. Now, the AI era is pushing another shift towards usage or outcome-based pricing (or at least hybrid). Incumbents are already evolving how they charge to better align with the value their software now delivers with AI, rather than strictly on a per-seat basis. If AI agents resolve a larger share of customer support tickets, a company will need far fewer human support reps, and thus fewer seats of a tool like Salesforce Service Cloud. In such a case, the logical pricing metric shifts to the outcome (e.g., the # of tickets resolved).

Bellwether OpenAI Lowering Agentic Forecasts: Likely Driven by Shift to Embedded AI: Per recent reporting, OpenAI's revenue forecasts were recently revised significantly higher to account for better

revenue capture from ChatGPT & new monetization strategies/products (i.e, advertising). H owever, upon closer examination, OpenAI's revenue assumptions actually were lowered on its agentic business: to $90B from 2025-2030 from $115B prior, a nearly 25% cut vs. its prior estimates . Included in these updated forecasts are $2B in 2025, $4B in 2026, $13B in 2027, $16B in 2028, $23B in 2029, and $31B in 2030. However, we note that it is more likely that OpenAI is now including more agentic functionality directly in ChatGPT, which corroborates the broader shift in software towards bundled strategies and embedded AI-where software solutions integrate AI features more directly into offerings rather than discretely monetize them.

Recent projections from Gartner suggest that software is unlikely to be replaced by generative AI applications and in fact less than 5% of the broader market will become generative AI-specific. Instead, Gartner projections assume that the market increasingly moves towards bundled AI solutions, where newer functionality is added as a complement to existing technologies, enhancing the features and functionality of embedded offers. In our view, this supports a view that software is less likely to be disrupted by generative AI tech and instead will be advanced by it. While this may not prove as significant of a near-term growth driver as originally anticipated, we expect that it helps solidify the underlying value proposition of software applications, particularly those that offer agentic capabilities.

Further evidence: Microsoft eliminates Copilot Pro in favor of Premium bundle: On 10/1, Microsoft announced that it would begin to bundle its consumer version of Copilot, known as Copilot Pro, into a new M365 offering instead of selling it separately. The company's new tier called Microsoft 365 Premium will be priced at $20/mo, and includes M365 Family plus Copilot Pro embedded in the offer. Previously, in order to get Copilot customers would've needed to purchase M365 Family for $13/ mo as well as Copilot Pro for $20/mo for a total of $33/mo. Now, customers only need to pay for a premium $20/mo subscription (a 54% premium over M365 Family vs. a 154% premium prior).

Adobe kicked off its most recent earnings call with a demo of nano-banana being used as the underlying model in a Photoshop workflow, reinforcing Adobe's willingness to offer customers choice and perhaps flexing the durability of its positioning as the entrenched end-to-end platform for creatives. Since then, we have spent time exploring how Adobe's generative credit model works, including how credits can be applied to the usage of third-party models. Our early work suggests thirdparty models can sometimes be cheaper to access via Adobe (vs. directly through the model provider), which could strengthen Adobe's position in our view.

Adobe Creative Cloud and Firefly users not only gain access to Adobe's commercially safe generative AI models, but an expansive list of leading third-party image, video, vector, and audio models, including from Google (Imagen, Veo, Flash 2.5), OpenAI (GPT Image), Black Forest Labs, Runway, Pika, Ideogram, Luma AI, Moonvalley, and more. This enables Adobe, regardless of which model creatives end up favoring, to establish a form of lock-in, where the Firefly App/Creative Cloud suite remains the operating system for content generation and editing.

More details to be shared at Adobe Max at the end of October: As stated on its recent earnings call, "we're excited to welcome our community at Adobe MAX next month. We'll showcase incredible innovations that highlight amazing productivity features in our flagship Creative Cloud applications, breakthrough AI capabilities leveraging Firefly and third-party models , new agentic experiences for conversational editing, and significant strides in content production automaton for enterprises. MAX is always a celebration of the community's creativity and we look forward to sharing how Adobe magic is transforming creative workflows and unlocking new opportunities."

· Standard vs. premium generations: Adobe draws a distinction between standard and premium generative features. Subscribers of Firefly, Adobe Express Premium, Creative Cloud Pro, and Creative Cloud for Enterprise gain access to unlimited standard generations, whereas standard generations cost 1 credit per generation for all other SKUs. Standard generative AI features include Generative Fill, Expand, Background, Harmonize (beta), Upscale, Text to Vector/Pattern, etc. However, any video-related features (Generative Extend, Text-to-Video, Image to Video, Translations, etc.), Text-to-Image, and Text-to-3D are all considered premium features that have rate cards to determine the credits used per function. · Credit Allocations by SKU : Creative Cloud Pro and Creative Cloud for Enterprise (VIP and VIP marketplace) includes 4,000 credits for premium generations (and unlimited standard generations); Creative Cloud for Enterprise (ELTA) includes 4,000-8,000 credits for premium generations; Adobe Express Premium includes 250 credits for premium generations; Firefly

Adobe recently passed through a price increase (took effect June 17th in the US and August 1st internationally). Under the new model, Individual/Teams All-App users are automatically upgraded to Creative Cloud Pro at renewal, providing access to 4,000 credits for premium AI generations at a $10/ month price increase (on average). In other words, the ~$10/month price increase corresponds to the value of the new AI usage embedded in plans. Users can downgrade to Creative Cloud Standard for $15/month less, although they would lose access to premium AI features. In our analysis of the cost to access third-party models via Adobe vs. directly from the model provider below, we ascribe $12.50/ month as the value of the 4,000 generative credits for premium AI (midpoint of the $10/month price increase and delta in price between Standard & Pro). We believe the math below understates the benefits users receive from being able to access a plethora of models in one place and the unlimited standard generations users gain via Adobe; that said, we would highlight it

While unclear exactly how this translates to revenue (i.e., if recognized on a gross or net basis), we view Adobe's AI strategy as taking more significant shape with potential to drive volume-based revenue contribution over time. Our checks, at least through FQ3, have indicated AI adoption has trended positively, though there were few instances of customers needing to re-up on credits. We believe this could change in the coming months under the new model as customers look to consolidate their model usage under Adobe's platform.

MNDY Sparked Debate on SEO Impacts to Software Vendors: Another branch of impacts we have seen relate to AI cannibalization of Search Engine Optimziation. At its I/O conference in May, Google announced that it has rolled out AI Overviews Worldwide reaching 1.5Bn users worldwide. The release marked a clear shift in the way advertising is done. Following onto this, MNDY noted on its last earnings call that the company had seen some softness in Q2 results driven by this wider change "So, look, I think, like we said, we optimize in real-time. We adjust the budget on a daily basis. Right now, the effects are very minor in terms of acquiring new accounts definitely for the kind of mid-market enterprise segment. We see a little bit of impact on the SMB part, but still very insignificant and we optimize this on a day-to-day basis. So we've done some optimization last month."

SimilarWeb data shows that MNDY has ramped Google AD spend to 2-year highs, up 84% y/y, which we believe will improve inbounds from the top of funnel and continue to contribute positively to the growth algorithm. Exhibit 22 - MNDY Google Ad Spend by Month

Source: Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and SimilarWeb Data Shows Initial Signs of Recovery: Post the comments made on the 2Q earnings call, data from SimilarWeb shows that unique visitors to monday.com have returned to low-teens growth, representing an acceleration from the prior year. While it would be quick to call a trough, initial signs show that companies have seen minimal impact from any SEO changes.

· INTU : In terms of AI search, it actually plays into our favor. And let me just share a couple of stats. One - and this is across by the way, our platform, not just QuickBooks, our traffic is actually up quite significantly this year. And AI search is 1% of our overall traffic. And the top 25% brands actually have a 10x visibility in AI search, so which is when you look at brands like QuickBooks and Credit Karma and TurboTax and Mailchimp, it actually plays into our favor. · HUBS : And, one thing I want to make very clear, search is getting disrupted, which means SEO is not as effective as it is before. But here's the key, content matters even more in the new world. The content needs to actually show up in social, it needs to show up in podcasts and newsletters, it needs to show up in LLM answers. And that is exactly what Marketing Hub and Content Hub will do.

- · DOCU : Yeah, we're not seeing anything yet. I think we're very pleased with our organic traffic. And Docusign has an amazing brand and recognition, reputation and I think that plays well both in an SEO world and a TDO world. With that said, look behavior, consumer and enterprise buying behavior is changing as a result of LLMs. And so I think we're keeping a very close eye on those changes and how that affects behavior throughout what we've historically talked about as the funnel. So that's number one.

AI Labs Could Represent Large Customers in Own Right: It's become clear that OpenAI and Anthropic are likely to become two of the largest companies on the planet over the next few years, in particular with revenue expectations for OpenAI estimated to climb to $200 billion in 2030. As of 2024, fewer than 50 companies globally have ever reached $200B+ revenue scale. It's likely that this will drive significant need for software applications to manage a business of this scale, particularly on the business side-CRM, HCM, ERP, productivity, etc. We believe these are underappreciated tenets of the software story today. For OpenAI, we expect much of its business application needs are supplied by ORCL (Fusion), CRM, and WDAY today. As shown below, sifting through the careers page at OpenAI suggests it currently uses Oracle Fusion (ERP, O2C/P2P), Salesforce (CRM, Slack), Workday, Figma Snowflake, Airtable, and Workato. Anthropic's website shows job postings w/

direct mentions of Oracle Netsuite, Workday, Salesforce, Atlassian (Jira), and DocuSign.
