Global Software SaaS multiple compression prices in full growth reversion The " GenAI will kill Software " narrative has strongly taken hold in the last 6 months, driving c . 3 0 % EV/EBITDA derating across global software. The space is now trading at 13 .1 x E V /EBITDA vs 5 y average of 21 x . Our EMEA coverage has seen forward PE compress 30 % in the past 6 months from 2 8.5 x to 19 x , mirroring similar trend at US peers compressing 35 % from 32.3 x to 21 x . With expected top line growth to 2027 in line with last 5 years average at 11%, the 35% multiple compression reflect s purely lower long term growth expectations. E MEA software now trades at P EG ratios of c1. 7 x , below 1.8x for the broader European market . Although we believe some segments of the tech ecosystem are bound to be profoundly impacted by Gen AI , we see current levels as attractive for stocks like B uy-rated SAP with strong moats and potential AI upside (both top line and bottom line) - see

SAP SE: 25 for 2026: demonstrating the AI opportunity . SAP illustration: g rowth shock priced in We run a reversed DCF model to understand what is priced in at the current share price, with SAP now trading on 2 0.7 x 2027 PE, down from 34x a year ago. Assuming no changes to our current 2026-2030 forecasts (c . 1 1 % revenue CAGR, c . 15% EBIT CAGR), we estimate the current share price reflects -3% revenue CAGR post 2030 , a 14% reduction to 2035, driving a 20% EBIT decline . This would require both a pick up in churn from existing customers (which we view as unlikely) and a stop to the on-premise to cloud migration, which remains less than half way completed. Software now in AI lo s er baskets… The bear thesis is three fold: 1/ new tools: companies will use new tools to address their t echnology needs, including from OpenAI Codex , Anthropic (Claude CoWork) or vibe coding providers ( Cursor, Lovable, Replit , Bolt AI

etc), 2/ new competition: lower barrier to entry on coding & software creation will generate both additional competition and price pressure , 3/ risk to seat based pricing model on GenAI productivity . .. but we are more selective Software companies are not equal in front of AI risks. Deep domain expertise and business integration are hard for new entrants to replicate, making complex, mission ‑ critical platforms like SAP and DSY less vulnerable as they embed GenAI using proprietary customer data. Highly regulated, complex, and low ‑ churn industries (banking, construction, manufacturing, ERP) remain difficult to disrupt . In addition, we believe i nnovative software incumbents are best positioned to build high ‑ value AI agents by leveraging their proprietary datasets - something general LLMs cannot access. As SaaS providers pivot to AI ‑

first offerings, we see increasing upside from monetization through new products and services. SAP for instance embeds Business AI at the core of its strategy with >50% cloud bookings consuming AI, while Sage enjoyed 1pp pricing upside from AI features in 2025, with more upside ahead on its Intacct Copilot.

Global Software AI Bull vs Bear Software now in AI lo s er baskets… The Software space has seen a 12% derating in 2025, followed by an additional 15% drop YTD, largely explained by increasing concerns on Gen AI impact (competition, business model risk). Gen AI is accelerating a shift in business models across software and IT services. The bear thesis is threefold : 1/ new tools: companies will use new tools to address their Technology needs, including from OpenAI Codex, Anthropic (Claude CoWork) or vibe coding providers (Lovable, Replit, Bolt, Cursor AI etc), 2/ new competition: lower barrier to entry on coding & software creation will generate both additional competition and price competition, 3/ risk to seat-based pricing model on more efficient GenAI tools. The concern is that seat-based pricing will face mid-term pressure as productivity gains reduce user counts, forcing vendors toward value or outcome-based models. The bigger risk lies in simpler apps as lower coding costs could drive new entrants, while ERP and PLM remain protected by data moats, long development cycles, and deep integration.

What are the mitigating factors? We believe those risks are all credible long term, however we see a number of differentiating factors across software providers. We see the delivery of domain expertise with deep business integration as difficult to replicate for newcomers . Cannibalization by agentic AI is less of a threat for complex, mission-critical platforms like SAP and Dassault Systemes, which are embedding Gen AI to enhance workflows leveraging on proprietary customer data. The bigger risk lies in simpler apps as lower coding costs could drive new entrants. Industries with high regulatory and compliance requirements (think Banking, Construction, Manufacturing etc), complex underlying regulation ( country-based tax / HR regulation) and low churn (ERP) will be harder to disrupt in our view. The AI bull case

We believe innovative software incumbents are ideally placed to leverage their existing data sets to develop agents offering the most valuable insights to their customers. General LLMs are powerful tools to develop software, however lack access to proprietary customer data, including transaction flow, design and modelling etc that are necessary to develop relevant features. In the coming years, we expect existing SaaS providers to fully switch their offering to an AI fist experience. We expect Generative AI to evolve from production to adoption phase, with more product launches or dedicated services paving the way for monetization. SAP has made Business AI the core of its product strategy, with benefits expected both on top line (>50% cloud backlog including AI) and costs ( € 2bn cost savings target by 2028), Sage has seen c1pp growth benefit at the group level in 2025 from initial AI pricing increases in the UK and has recently launched its Intacct AI Copilots.

In enterprise software, SAP and Oracle embed AI into ERP implementations to simplify configuration and post-go-live support, while Microsoft deploys Copilot across finance, HR, and procurement workflows. Adoption is accelerating: 80% of organizations increased GenAI investment since 2023, and multi-function integration rose from 6% to 25% year-on-year. Cost efficiencies but modest ROI McKinsey '

s latest AI survey shows that most respondents report cost savings from generative AI across key functions, particularly software engineering, manufacturing, and IT. However, its impact on enterprise-wide profitability remains limited. Over 80% of respondents say their organizations have yet to see a meaningful effect on EBIT from gen AI adoption. Exhibit 13 : The majority of respondents report costs decrease from the use of GenAI across multiple functions Costs decrease within business units from Gen AI use in the past 12 months, by function, % respondents Source: McKinsey The State of AI in 2025 BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Despite efficiency gains, ROI from AI remains modest. Most deployments still focus on productivity rather than monetization, with typical returns in the low single digits. Advanced programs show potential, Deloitte reports 74% meet or exceed expectations, and some achieve returns above 20%, though these cases are exceptions. Strategic impact depends on embedding AI deeply into core workflows and scaling beyond pilots, rather than rolling out isolated features.

U.S. vendors like Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow are moving toward AI-native architectures and premium pricing models, while European peers remain focused on incremental enhancements. This structural gap raises investor concerns: without faster integration and pricing innovation, incumbents risk margin erosion as AI-native entrants scale with lean architectures and quicker innovation cycles. For now, efficiency is the headline benefit. Monetization and competitive differentiation will hinge on deeper integration and readiness for the next wave of autonomous AI. Revenue gains from AI, beyond generative AI, are most often reported in marketing and sales, strategy and corporate finance, and product development, but rarely exceed 10%.

General AI and Gen AI adoption McKinsey '

s latest survey indicates that more organizations are adopting AI, though most have yet to scale it. The share of respondents reporting AI use in at least one business function rose to 88% , up from 78% last year. However, at the enterprise level, progress remains limited: the majority are still in the experimentation or pilot phase, with only about one-third saying their companies have begun scaling AI programs.

In IT services, European firms are deploying GenAI across advisory, engineering, and operations to accelerate delivery and reduce manual effort. Capgemini integrates AI copilots into application modernization and testing, Atos embeds AI into infrastructure management and cybersecurity, and Sopra Steria applies AI in banking for compliance reporting and fraud detection. Alten uses GenAI for simulation and design automation in automotive and aerospace, while Kainos and Netcompany leverage AI for healthcare and public sector workflows, including document processing and conversational interfaces for e-government platforms. European companies are catching up, SAP is infusing AI across its entire product portfolio, including S/4HANA and SuccessFactors, while Dassault Systemes leverages AI in simulation and design tools, but most initiatives focus on improving user experience and productivity rather than generating standalone revenue. Gen AI in software: structural gap in integration between the US and Europe

Rollouts in Europe are accelerating, yet most remain incremental enhancements rather than deep product integration. SAP and Dassault Systemes are exceptions, embedding GenAI into ERP and PLM platforms, but progress is gradual. Others including Temenos or Planisware are embedding AI across their offering but with no identified separate monetization potential. In contrast, U.S. vendors are moving toward AI-native architectures and premium pricing models, positioning themselves for scalable monetization and competitive differentiation. US: moving from peripheral AI features to AI-native architectures

U.S. enterprise software vendors continue to set the pace in Generative AI adoption. Initial deployments focused on peripheral features such as copilots for productivity tools, but have evolved into deep integration within mission-critical applications. Companies like Microsoft and Salesforce are embedding AI across ERP, CRM, and productivity suites, supported by premium monetization models including usage-based pricing and subscription add-ons. Development timelines for core features have been cautious due to accuracy requirements and reputational risks, as seen in early missteps by Alphabet. Today, U.S. companies are moving toward AI-native architectures, positioning themselves for scalable monetization and long-term competitive advantage. Generative AI is now firmly embedded across enterprise software: Microsoft integrates Copilot into Office 365 and Dynamics, Salesforce offers Einstein GPT as a CRM enhancement, and ServiceNow incorporates AI into ITSM and HR modules to drive automation.

European software vendors are accelerating Generative AI rollouts, but positioning varies significantly. SAP and Dassault Systemes stand out as clear leaders, not only because of their advanced AI roadmaps but also due to their scale and ability to monetize. SAP ' s Joule copilot and Joule Studio enable customizable AI agents across finance, HR, supply chain, procurement, and customer experience, creating deep workflow integration and premium monetization opportunities through seat-based and consumption-based pricing. DSY ' s 3DUNIV+RSES embeds GenAI into its 3DEXPERIENCE platform, introducing virtual companions for HR, finance, and engineering and Virtual Twin-as-a-Service powered by sovereign LLMs via Mistral AI, expected to generate incremental revenue from 2026. These capabilities complement existing offerings rather than replace them, reinforcing Dassault ' s high-value positioning in simulation and PLM. Sage has launched premium-priced offering in some of its UK portfolio (including Sage 50) embedding AI features (12% price uplift ) and

expects further traction on the launch of Sage Intacct Copilot. GenAI: where are we going? Coding: Gen AI's most impactful use case today The main use case for Generative AI today is coding. In software development, GenAI-powered coding assistants deliver 10 - 15% productivity gains (according to Bain). Yet, these time savings often fail to translate into higher-value outcomes without workflow redesign, highlighting a key debate: efficiency gains are clear, but strategic impact depends on scaling and integration. Coding remains the most important GenAI use case. Capgemini notes that tools like GitHub Copilot, AWS Amazon Q Developer, Google Gemini Code Assist, and Codeium can generate code from natural language, assist with syntax completion, and create boilerplates and prototypes. Advanced algorithms even detect bug-prone patterns and suggest fixes, improving both speed and accuracy. Beyond coding: agentic AI will expand its reach across enterprise workflows However, this coding supremacy will likely

shift. Agentic AI, autonomous agents that can orchestrate processes, manage infrastructure, and execute code, will transform IT services and enterprise software beyond 2026. This shift moves AI from task-level assistance to full workflow orchestration, positioning it as a strategic enabler rather than a productivity tool. Capgemini and Atos are piloting agent-based platforms for IT operations and cybersecurity, while Alten is developing AI-driven digital twins for automotive and aerospace. Sopra Steria is investing in autonomous compliance and fraud detection for banking, signalling a broader move toward AI-enabled orchestration that compresses delivery cycles and reshapes cost structures. The next paradigm is expected to

extend beyond 2026, combining autonomous agents with knowledge graphs and simulation tools to unlock new enterprise use cases. Microsoft and ServiceNow are already exploring agent-based workflows for IT operations, while SAP and Siemens invest in digital twins and autonomous process orchestration. This evolution will redefine SaaS economics and competitive dynamics, marking the transition from incremental automation to AI-native architectures.

Generative AI is challenging the traditional seat-based subscription model that has long defined SaaS economics. As AI-driven personalization and variable workloads become central to product value, static pricing tied to user seats looks increasingly misaligned with customer expectations. Vendors are pivoting toward outcome-based pricing, where fees reflect measurable business impact such as productivity gains or cost savings. Additionally, unbundling AI features into premium add-ons or usage-based models is gaining traction, allowing clients to pay only for advanced capabilities they actively use. This evolution points to a more flexible, consumption-driven structure, aligning pricing with the tangible value GenAI delivers rather than fixed access fees. Different approaches to AI features pricing across the US and Europe

In software, regional strategies for AI monetization diverge sharply. U.S. vendors such as Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Microsoft increasingly unbundle AI features, offering them as premium add-ons or usage-based credits, signalling a trend toward treating AI as a distinct revenue stream. Conversely, European providers like SAP embed basic AI within standard pricing and only charge separately for advanced capabilities, reflecting slower, customer-driven demand and a push to accelerate adoption rather than monetize aggressively.

For IT services, near-term monetization remains limited, especially in Europe, where Capgemini, Sopra Steria, and Atos bundle GenAI into transformation or managed services deals without explicit pricing. U.S. peers such as Accenture and Deloitte are experimenting with outcome-based and value-driven models, aligning pricing with measurable business impact. As automation reduces effort and accelerates delivery, traditional time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts become misaligned, pressuring margins. Over time, European companies will need to pivot toward flexible, consumption-based frameworks to capture incremental AI-driven revenue. Gen AI adoption and strategic implications Lower barriers to entry, higher competitive risk Generative AI significantly lowers the barriers to entry for new competitors in the SaaS market. AI-native startups are building platforms from the ground up with GenAI at their

core, rather than retrofitting existing architectures. This native approach enables faster innovation cycles, leaner cost structures, and highly personalized user experiences, which can erode the competitive advantage of established SaaS vendors. As these startups leverage AI to automate development, scale rapidly, and deliver differentiated features at lower prices, incumbents face the risk of losing market share unless they accelerate their own AI integration and rethink pricing and product strategies. Software and IT services incumbents are working to accelerate AI integration across delivery, transition pricing to outcome-based models, and redesign workflows to capture ROI. Investments in proprietary AI platforms and partnerships with hyperscalers (Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) will be critical to defend margins and differentiate offerings. Firms that position early for Agentic AI will lead the next wave of transformation; those that delay risk commoditization and margin erosion.
