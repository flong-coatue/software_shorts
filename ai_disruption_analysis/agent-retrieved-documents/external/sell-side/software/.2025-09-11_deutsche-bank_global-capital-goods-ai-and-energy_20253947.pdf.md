AI-related stocks took a hit last month on concerns that the AI boom may come to an end. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself said that investors are "overexcited" while a study from MIT reported that 95% of generative AI pilots have delivered so far little or no measurable impact to earnings. So will AI efforts deliver positive ROIs or are investments in data centers moving too fast? Will demand for data centers rise amid a continued surge in AI usage, or will it fall as technological advances make AI less compute-heavy and cheaper? Will power shortages become a major constraint to AI deployment or will electricity demand de-couple from data center growth? The aim of this report is to explore these questions (and more).

We believe we are still in the middle of a multi-year data center investment cycle and feel comfortable with a 15% CAGR (at least) over the next several years. With AI, intelligence has now been digitized. Every country and every company will utilize this digitalized intelligence, much like they currently use electricity or the internet. Processing demand should further accelerate with the advent of reasoning models, the deployment of AI agents and physical AI, as well as investments in sovereign AI. The market for inferencing should eventually become even larger than the market for training AI. Continued strong investments by Cloud service providers should be complemented by accelerated demand from enterprise modernization. AI began in the cloud and is now expanding into enterprise IT, manufacturing and the edge.

The convergence of data and power should remain a major investment theme. More data has been generated in the last 3 years than in all of history while, concurrently, the rate at which the power intensity of data processing is reduced has diminished. Overall, data center electricity demand is expected to double by 2030. The location of data centers tends to be rather concentrated in specific regions, which exacerbates power shortages and grid constraints locally. In the US, growth in data center electricity consumption is expected to represent nearly half of total electricity demand growth in the next 5 years. The AI revolution will only fully materialize if sufficient power and grid infrastructure are available to support it.

We view the recent underperformance of data center / AI-related names as a buying opportunity as the combination of the rapid build-up of AI infrastructure and growing demand for power continues to create unprecedented growth opportunities for most electrical equipment vendors within our coverage universe. Our top picks are Siemens Energy, Schneider (upgraded to BUY on September 1), Legrand and Prysmian in Europe, and Vertiv in the US.

In mature economies, electricity demand has been stagnant or even down slightly over the past 15 years due to energy efficiency measures being implemented, slow industrial production growth and the shift of energy-intensive heavy industries to emerging markets. However, electricity demand is now on the rise again, fuelled by the trend towards more pervasive electrification in all aspects of their economies including the deployment of electric vehicles, air conditioners, heat pumps and above all data centers.

Electricity and data center markets are more intertwined than ever. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), data centers accounted for 415TWh in 2024, equivalent to 1.5% of the world's electricity demand, with the US accounting for 45%, followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%). Data center electricity demand has grown at 12% per year since 2017 and is projected to increase at a CAGR of 15% by 2030, when it should then account for around 3% of the world's electricity demand. The location of data centers tends to be rather concentrated in specific regions, which exacerbates power shortages and grid constraints locally. In the US, growth in data center electricity consumption is expected to represent nearly half of total electricity demand growth in the next 5 years.

Data center electricity demand is expected to nearly double by 2030. From 2010 to 2020, data center electricity usage remained relatively stable, even as data production surged from 2 to 64 ZB over the same period as technical efficiency gains in chip design and cooling techniques largely offset the demand for energy. However, there has been a shift beginning in 2020. Since then, the average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of data centers has been essentially flat and data center energy demand has started to re-align with growth in data generation. Driven by rising cloud usage and more complex and energy-intensive computing workloads for AI, global server capacity could exceed 1,000TWh by 2030.

The development of more efficient AI models (e.g. DeepSeek) means companies will invest more, not less in AI. This is the Jevons paradox. Cheaper AI and opensource technology should democratize AI adoption and accelerate the deployment of AI applications across more industries and regions. Cheaper training should also encourage companies to retrain models and experiment new models more frequently. We therefore see DeepSeek's announcement as part of the natural progression of AI technology. In addition, while DeepSeek may save energy in training, this is eventually offset by more intensive techniques for inference. Reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 use a "chain-of-thought" architecture that typically results in longer and better answers. Reasoning models therefore compute more intensively than generative AI models (100-1,000x). If all the new AI models that are released become reasoning models, this should then lead to evergrowing computing and energy demand. The CEO of Oracle recently confirmed the enormity of the AI inferencing opportunity, "well beyond the multi-trillion dollar market for AI training".

AI is growing fast and requires substantial infrastructure spending. Nvidia sees data centers as the factories of AI. These factories aim to generate as many tokens as possible, but also as quickly as possible to reduce the response time and improve customers' service quality. Processing demands should further accelerate with the advent of applications like reasoning models and the deployment of agentic AI and physical AI. We see continued strong investments by cloud service providers but also rising demand from enterprise modernization (~half of total global IT spend). AI began in the cloud and is now expanding into enterprise IT, manufacturing and edge computing environments. Datacenter capex could grow to $1T by 2028, implying a +25% CAGR.

The convergence of data and power should remain a major investment theme as the AI revolution will only fully materialize if sufficient power and grid infrastructure are available to support it. Our global top picks are BUY-rated Siemens Energy, Schneider, Legrand, Vertiv and Prysmian. We also like BUYrated Eaton and nVent in the LV/MV electrical market, GE Vernova in the grid and gas turbine markets, as well as BUY-rated Nexans in the cables market. We are more cautious on ABB, Siemens and Hubbell.

The shares have recently lost momentum due to jitters over Nvidia's results and MHI's capacity plans as well as negative newsflow on US wind (stop-work order from US Department for the Revolution Wind offshore project). Fundamentals remain however extremely favorable. Siemens Energy is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing investment supercycle in the electric power system. Stronger electricity consumption growth, high replacement needs due to an ageing base and the energy transition continue to require massive investments in energy infrastructure, supporting Siemens Energy's grid and gas turbine businesses. Data center customers accounted for one-third of gas turbine orders in the latest

quarter. At the upcoming CMD in November, we anticipate that management will raise its FY28 revenue CAGR objective to low teens and its EBITA margin objective by 2pts to 12-14%. The group could also announce the sale or spin-off of its Compression business and simplification of its reporting structure through the elimination of the ToI division. Siemens Energy's commercial dynamics are stunning, with the group growing at a faster pace than peers in both Grid and Gas. Close peer GE Vernova's premium valuation (27x 2026e EV/EBITDA vs ENR at 13x) should continue to provide support as ENR continues to gain share and executes on the turnaround of Gamesa.

The stock is down 5% YTD and has significantly underperformed its electrical peers in both Europe (Legrand, ABB, Siemens) and the US (Eaton, Vertiv, nVent). This can be attributed to the absence of positive EPS revisions and disappointing margin momentum over the past 12 months. Schneider plans to host a new CMD in London on December 11. We estimate that the group's financial targets will remain largely unchanged - specifically a 7-10% organic revenue CAGR and organic margin expansion of around 50bps per annum, on average, by 2027. However, we anticipate more detailed information on how these targets will be achieved, likely through a more structured program. The CEO already indicated that he will put a greater emphasis on productivity and SG&A optimization. This heightened focus

on productivity is positive news as we previously felt that the group was beginning to lose some of its cost discipline; however, this concern is now being addressed, which strengthens our confidence in the group's margin momentum for 2026. The stock currently trades at a small discount to its direct competitors, which appears unjustified given the company's undisputed market leadership in electrification, one-stop-shop profile for data centers and stronger software franchise.

We like Legrand's resilient business model, solid pricing power, best-in class FCF generation capabilities and value-creative M&A strategy. We expect the stock to continue to re-rate as the group's main verticals (housing and offices) should bottom out in 2026, raising investors' confidence in its ability to deliver even stronger growth in the future. Data centers represent 24% of group revenue and should deliver 30-35% organic growth in 2025, making the FY guidance look conservative. We expect management will raise (again) its 5-7% organic growth guidance by 1 or 2pts in conjunction with the Q3 release. We also anticipate that the group will increase its medium-term margin objective of 20%, potentially by up to 2pts, in the course of 2026 as the prospective recovery in the EU residential market should have a disproportionately positive impact on group margins.

Vertiv is a unique pure-play data center equipment manufacturer with 85% exposure to the end market. Hyperscalers continue to positively revise capex, boosting confidence in sustained data center growth while rising power rack densities further drive the need for liquid cooling. The group's strong medium-term growth trajectory (targeted 12-14% organic revenue CAGR, potentially 20%+ in a blue-sky scenario) and solid self-help margin story (targeting 25% adj. operating margins by 2029) make the stock attractive, especially following recent underperformance. Vertiv's valuation premium to peers looks rather low considering the group's much higher exposure to the data center industry and strong order/backlog dynamics (2Q25 orders at $3.2bn, +15% Y/Y).

Prysmian, a global leader in wire and cable production, is well positioned to capitalize on booming demand from grid modernization, expansion, and the rapid growth of data centers, an area where its contribution is set to double this year (>5% of group). Its extensive portfolio, bolstered by recent acquisitions like Encore Wire (creating a virtual duopoly in US low voltage cables) and Channell (enhancing data center offerings), allows for comprehensive integrated solutions and superior service. Prysmian should increasingly benefit from its strong presence in the US, which now accounts for nearly half of its EBITDA, and where the group should gain a significant advantage from US tariffs on imported copper and aluminum cables due to its domestic manufacturing. Despite a robust backlog and strong growth prospects (16% EBITA CAGR

forecast 2024-28), Prysmian trades at an undemanding valuation (c.25% discount to electrical peers), with positive catalysts including the upcoming Q3 results Q3 results where there is upside to the current FY guidance driven by copper tariffs in the US, and 2/ a potential secondary listing in New York.

YTD, large electrical companies - Schneider, ABB, Vertiv, Eaton, Hubbell - have underperformed the industrial sector as enthusiasm for AI has subsided after DeepSeek's announcement, Microsoft's temporary pause on capex and various reports suggesting that investors were overexcited over AI's returns and future growth dynamics. We expect the subsector's valuations to remain volatile given its greater reliance on tech spending but currently view recent weakness as a buying opportunity for most names, with support from a multi-year investment cycle in data centers, power generation and power transmission. The collapse of Vertiv and Schneider's premium vs. other electrical equipment players understates

their ability to grow at a faster pace than peers in the medium-term and make the shares look particularly attractive, in our view. ENR's significant (and unjustified) discount to GEV should also continue to support the stock. With this report, we increase our TPs for Schneider to €250 (from €240), for Legrand to €145 (from €144) and for ABB to SF47 (from SF45).

AI is growing fast and its impact will likely be larger than any platform shifts before, including the internet, mobile and cloud. AI is developing through multiple waves and each wave appears to further boost the consumption of computing and, consequently, the consumption of electricity.

AI really gained media coverage about a decade ago, starting with extractive AI , i.e. AI models that can understand patterns, recognize speech or images. Five years ago, with the launch of ChatGPT, the focus switched to generative AI which has the ability to not just understand but to generate.

The CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, explains that generative AI fundamentally changes how computing is done. In the past, computing was based on a retrieval model which was essentially about creating content in advance, storing multiple versions of it and fetching the most appropriate version whenever needed. Computing is now based on a generative model. Rather than just retrieving the data, generative AI creates original content: it understands the context and generates answers to questions. It can generate from text to text, text to images, images to text, or even video - so it is a universal translator from anything to anything else.

Even more progress was achieved in the last couple of years with the development of reasoning models, leading to the era of agentic AI. This means that AI now has agency, i.e. the ability to take action and choose what action to take. Agentic AI can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem. It can fetch multi-modality information (text, images, video, etc), learn, plan and take action. A reasoning model typically breaks a problem down step by step using the "chain-ofthought" technology. It solves the problem in different ways by applying different rules and theorems, ensures it has the same answer for consistency checking or chooses the best answer. It can also put back the answer into the equation to confirm its accuracy. This is different from generative AI like ChatGPT which simply provides a straight, one-shot answer and cannot get it right all the time.

AI agents are already being used to perform tasks like coding or answering customer questions. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company has cut its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 by using AI agents to automate some tasks. Reasoning models are more complex and more compute-intensive than generative AI models. As they think, they iterate and generate more thoughts before producing the answers, so they generate more tokens. Assuming they generate 10 times more tokens, they also need to compute 10 times faster to keep the models responsive and interactive so that people don't wait too long for their answers. In this example, the amount of computation for inference is therefore 100 times higher.

The next wave is physical AI. Physical AI means that AI understands the physical 3-dimensional world and things like friction and inertia, cause and effect, and object permanence. This level of AI can then go into a physical body, i.e. a robot or a self-driving car. Humanoid robots could be the next big thing. Nvidia sees it as the next multi-trillion dollar industry. Humanoid robots could further boost the consumption of computing as they need AI for training but also AI for simulation of how to be a well-functioning robot in a virtual environment. Similarly, self-driving cars act like robots and they need 3 layers of AI: one for training the model, one for simulating the AI model and one deployed into the car itself. Nvidia considers that industrial companies will eventually "need to built two factories, one to build the machines, and another to build their robotic AI".

As AI can reason and gets smarter, the amount of computation necessary to train the models and to do inferences keeps growing. And, as AI models become more useful, more and more people are deploying and using AI. General-purpose computing is gradually being replaced by accelerated computing. Traditional software running on computers is shifting to machinelearning software running on GPUs and accelerators. In the past, software engineers wrote software so that we could run it on computers. Going forward, computers will become generators of tokens rather than retrieve information. The entire computing stack will be different, with different processors, operating systems and applications. This way of doing computing requires substantial capex and that's the reason why the datacenter build-out has accelerated so much in recent years. Not only are more data centers being built, but they are also built with a different architecture with GPUs. With AI, intelligence has now been digitized. Every country and every company will utilize this digitalized intelligence, much like they currently use electricity or the internet.

Data centers are the factories of AI. Whenever you put a query into ChatGPT or another AI tool, inference generates tokens. Tokens are the unit of data in an AI model which are created through a process called tokenization, where each piece of data is broken down into smaller constituent units. During training, the model learns the relationships between tokens so it can perform inference and generate a relevant output. When these tokens are reformulated into words, there can be several tokens per word and one token can be used for several words. The more tokens you generate, the more reasoning tokens and consistency checking tokens, the smarter the AI. At the same time, you also want to produce tokens for as many customers as possible to maximize revenues and profit. The flip side of the coin is that the more tokens you generate, the longer it takes to get an answer. So there is a trade-off. What matters is to generate as many tokens as possible, but also as quickly as possible to reduce the response time and improve customers' service quality. Nvidia sees AI data centers as AI factories which have to

find the right balance between latency and throughput. AI began in the cloud but will also move to enterprise IT, manufacturing and into the edge. It started in the cloud because cloud data centers had strong computer science and the infrastructure available to do machine learning. Going forward, AI will diffuse everywhere. For example, in the automotive industry, AI will be used to optimize the design and simulation of the cars, but also the manufacturing of the cars, and even the cars themselves with the development of self-driving cars. As AI goes into Enterprise IT, it will rather be on-premise because of security and access control reasons.

DeepSeek's more efficient approach raises the question whether big capex, highpower densities and massive amounts of electricity are still needed to deploy top AI models. In January 2025, DeepSeek announced that its free, open-source large language model took only two months (2,78m of GPU computing hours) using one cluster with only 2,048 Nvidia's H800 chips. For comparison, Meta trained the Llama models on 2 clusters using 39,3m GPU hours with 49,152 Nvidia's H100 chips. Of note, the H800 chips are similar to the H100 but adapted to the Chinese market and were acquired by DeepSeek before US export restrictions were put in place. DeepSeek's models use shorter training cycles and fewer data and therefore lower the number of compute hours per training task compared to more traditional AI models. Amongst other things, DeepSeek developed an optimized MoE approach (Mixture of Experts) in which only a small part of the model's billions of parameters (the knobs) is used at a given time during training.

The use of cheaper and more efficient AI models should democratize AI adoption and accelerate the deployment of AI applications across more industries and regions. So even if AI dedicated datacenters consume less energy than previously anticipated, energy demand may still increase. Lower-cost models could also shift data center capex away from hyperscalers' centralized infrastructure to more distributed and smaller data centers, at the enterprise and at the edge level, supporting both latency and digital sovereignty issues. Overall, we see DeepSeek's announcement as part of the natural progression of AI technology for which efficiency gains had already been anticipated.

The CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella wrote on LinkedIn: 'Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of.' The Jevons paradox comes from the analysis made in 1865 by English economist William Jevons that more efficient use of coal through technology improvements actually increased the consumption of coal. Cheaper AI means more AI: the more people use AI in the real world, the more data will be collected, the more effective AI will become and the more uses will emerge.

AI models have 2 phases: training and inference. 1/ Training is when the model learns from data, the process of which can last several months. 2/ Once the model is ready, inference happens each time someone has a request. Both steps require significant amounts of electricity to run the and cool the servers. Reasoning AI produces better answers the longer it thinks but it is also very compute-intensive, requiring 100-1,000 times more tokens per task than previous one-shot inference from chatbots.

"Game theory" and competitive pressures are pushing web giants to continue to spend as much and as quickly as possible to stay ahead of the AI race. Anthropic cofounder Dario Amodei estimates that 'the gains in cost efficiency end up entirely devoted to training smarter models, limited only by the company's financial resources'. It appears that the advantage of having a more intelligent model is so high that companies are willing to spend more, not less on training models. With open-source technology and cheaper training, more AI developers beyond hyperscalers should also be able to invest in AI training infrastructure. AI is now moving to enterprise IT, manufacturing and into the edge. Cheaper training also encourage companies to retrain models and experiment new models more frequently.

Breakthroughs in post-training like synthetic data generation and reinforcement learning generate more tokens and increase training demand as models can be fine-tuned and applied to specific applications. There's only so much data available that you need AI to teach the AI. Synthetic data generation processes produce new, artificial data (e.g. structured tables, images, videos) that are statistically similar to the original data but are no direct copies. This increases the size and diversity of training datasets, enables more robust testing in various simulated scenarios, including rare events usually not happening in the real world, and allows companies to work with data even when original data is scarce, expensive or contains sensitive information. Reinforcing learning is equivalent to using a robotic approach to teach the AI; it learns through direct experience and feedback. This method is used in autonomous driving, gaming and robotics.

Reasoning models for inference require significantly more compute. A study by the MIT Technology Review shows that DeepSeek is more energy intensive to come to its answers than the equivalent model from Meta with the same number of parameters (70 billion). DeepSeek has a similar energy efficiency to the Meta model, but it tends to generate much longer responses and therefore was found to use 87% more energy. The query "is it okay to lie?" generated a 1,000-word response from the DeepSeek model, which took 17,800 joules to generate, equivalent to a 10-minute YouTube video. This was about 41% more energy than Meta's model used to answer the same query.

While DeepSeek saves energy on training, this is offset by its more intensive techniques for answering questions, and by the longer answers they generate. DeepSeek-R1 is a reasoning model (like OpenAI's o1) which is more energy intensive than other traditional large language models. That's because it uses a "chain-of-thought" architecture that typically results in longer and better answers. Reasoning models compute more intensively than generative AI models as they break the requests into parts and work through them in a logical order before giving the answer. While generative AI is good at searching information or summarizing text, reasoning models tend to give more accurate answers and can be used in logic and solve problems.

If all the new AI models that are released become reasoning models, then chainof-thought will be used into everything, even where it is not needed, i.e. for basic questions . This would be rather inefficient and should lead to ever-growing computing and energy demand. We have been here before. AI started with perception AI, speech recognition, computer vision - all based on a retrieval computing model. With the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, we moved from extractive

AI to generative AI to generate similar tasks, which requires more energy. Generative AI has already been added into web searches and messaging apps, and chain-of-thought models are likely next. For the same reason, at the 2025 GTC, Nvidia was highly bullish about the future of AI compute spend, with its expectations for inference-related compute needs having 100x'ed since last year's GTC as the group's assumptions now incorporates the proliferation of applications like reasoning models (more accurate but also more compute intensive compared to traditional LLMs) and edge inference. The CEO of Oracle recently confirmed the enormity of the AI inferencing opportunity, well beyond the multi-trillion dollar market for AI training.

The market for inferencing AI will become larger than the market for training AI. Oracle's share price surged by 30% following the publication of its FQ1'26 results as the group reported RPO of $455bn, up 359% YoY - a QoQ increase of $317bn well above consensus of +$120bn QoQ. Oracle now expects its cloud infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18bn this year, followed by $32bn, $73bn, $114bn and $144bn in subsequent four years - a 70% CAGR supported by the reported RPO. The CEO of Oracle Larry Ellison expects the market for AI inferencing to become even larger than the AI training market. He estimates that "people are running out of inferencing capacity and that "demand continues to dramatically

outstrip demand", flagging an unusual request from a customer willing to take any available capacity worldwide - for inferencing purposes. Nvidia also recently reported a sharp jump in inference demand. Nvidia's Grace Blackwell was designed to provide such a step up in inference performance and still a get a quick response, with 40x higher speed and throughput compared to Hopper. In fiscal Q2'26, Nvidia delivered its trademark beat and sales, with revenues growing to $47bn in Q2, driven by the continued Blackwell ramp and expected to reach $54bn in Q3.

DeepSeek was a 'Sputnik moment' far beyond the US. By adding to security concerns but also showing what can be done outside the US, it adds to both pressure and incentives to invest in sovereign AI. Countries are increasingly willing to build their own supercomputers and data centers. Otherwise, with 'hosted AI', they depend on third-party providers and do not fully control the infrastructure or data storage. Specifically, the EU plans to invest €20bn to establish 20 AI factories including 5 "gigafactories" to increase it AI compute infrastructure by 10 times.

Nations appear to be ready to invest in AI infrastructure like they did before for electricity and the internet. As shown in the tables below, new data center hubs are now under development globally, not just in the US, with the main factors driving geographical choices being proximity to customers, land availability and building permit approval, fiber carrier connectivity, power availability and skilled labor. In fiscal Q2'26, Nvidia indicated that they are on track to achieve over $20bn in sovereign AI revenue this year, more than double that of last year.

Top 30 Markets: Planned Pre-Leased Rate

Investments in data centers have nearly doubled since 2022 to around €500bn in 2024. Hyperscaler capex accounts for around half of total data center capex and is expected to increase by +57% Y/Y for 2025, after +60% growth in 2024. While data center growth has been predominantly driven by the Cloud in prior years, the development of AI is a major incremental driver. Hopes for a data center bonanza peaked in January when President Trump unveiled the Stargate Project, a Softbankbacked joint venture to invest $100bn, and eventually $500bn, in new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the US. Despite recent concerns around DeepSeek and the relatively poor ROIs so far, demand still significantly exceeds supply and hyperscalers (along with some enterprises) continue to invest aggressively.

Global demand for data center capacity could almost triple by 2030, with about 70% coming from AI workloads, according to McKinsey. In 2023, 57 GW of power was leased to data centers globally. In 2025, 82GW of power should be leased, with this projected to grow to 103GW next year and 219GW by 2030. This includes growth across non-AI workloads coupled with a 3.5x increase in AI workloads over that time frame.

of the decade. The group had previously guided for data center capex to grow to $1T by 2028, implying a +25% CAGR. While the market definition is somewhat different and there is little precision on the moving parts, it appears that Nvidia has become increasingly bullish. The group estimates that processing demands will further accelerate with the advent of applications like reasoning models (more accurate but also more compute intensive compared to traditional LLMs) and edge inference. The group sees continued investments by Cloud service providers but also strong demand from Enterprise modernization (~half of total global IT spend). During DB's data center summit in June, public and private data center operators noted the breadth and diversity of hyperscale demand, which meant that nuances from specific players should not impact the overall market outlook. In addition, operators noted incremental demand from Sovereigns and neo-clouds.

In Q2'25, the four largest US CSPs (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle) increased their capex estimates for CY25/26 by 13%/16%, which now calls for yoy capex growth of 57% in 2025 and low teens in 2026. They all reported strong results and accelerating backlog growth that we calculate rose >35% y/y for the four

in aggregate. Combined with current demand that is outpacing supply, this is giving CSPs the green light to continue to invest. In particular, Google raised its CapEx estimate for 2025 to $85bn, up from $75bn previously. This reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of delivery of servers, and an acceleration in the pace of data center construction. They also expect to remain in a tight demandsupply environment going into 2026 with a further increase in CapEx. Similarly, Oracle expects that FY26 CapEx will be higher, at over $25bn, as they work to meet demand from their backlog. The vast majority of CapEx investments is for revenuegenerating equipment that is going into data centers and not for land or buildings.

Data center capex should accelerate outside the hyperscaler space as the number of AI startups continues to increase and open-source models allow enterprises and industrial companies to invest more into AI. Approximately $100bn of AI startups were funded in 2024 and this has already grown to $180bn so far this year. AI startups are expected to generate $20bn of revenues this year, 10x more than last year. As the hallucination rates diminish and cost efficiencies improve, enterprises should also drive more AI investments in real-world tasks. Non-AI workloads will also continue to support data center capacity demand growth. DB Tech analysts estimate that we are still in the early innings of the shift to public cloud. Leveraging market share data from Gartner, they estimate that

public cloud infrastructure spending (IaaS + PaaS) still only accounts for ~28% of the global infrastructure TAM. Looking at the trend over the past five years we are clearly on the upward inflection of the 'S curve' of public cloud adoption. Share gains accelerated ~4pts annually over 2019-2021 but eased to ~2% in 2023 as optimization activity increased and customers became more cost conscious. We saw a modest rebound in cloud adoption rates in 2024 on fading optimizations, the unfreezing of migration work and a growing GenAI contribution. Assuming just a +3pt/yr slope over the next 3-years would imply annual public cloud infrastructure growth in the mid-20%s based on overall spending forecasts.

In the US, data center construction spending is already nearly equivalent to that of general offices. Turning to leading indicators, the July Dodge Momentum Index rose 31% Y/Y and 21% M/M, marking the highest absolute level on record. 'Planning data skyrocketed in the month of July on the back of several large projects entering the planning queue for data centers, research & development labs, hospitals and service stations,' stated an associate director of forecasting at Dodge Construction Network. "After months of wait-and-see due to tariff uncertainty, owners and developers have begun to move forward with projects and assumed higher costs for them.'

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), data centers accounted for 415TWh in 2024, equivalent to 1.5% of the world's electricity demand , with the US accounting for 45%, followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%). Data center electricity demand has grown 12% per year since 2017. Data center electricity demand is projected to increase at a CAGR of nearly 15% to reach 945TWh by 2030. It should then account for around 3% of the world's electricity demand. By 2035, it should further rise to 1,200TWh under the IEA's base case scenario.

AI-dedicated data center electricity demand currently accounts for less than 0.5% of global electricity demand but it is expected to multiply by at least 10x in 20232026. Training and deployment of AI models take place in large and very energyintensive data centers, with the largest under construction expected to consumer as much electricity as 2m households. A 30MW datacenter was considered large 10 years ago, but a 200MW facility is now considered normal. According to Vertiv, AI training data centers are typically 500MW in size, against 100MW for AI inference data centers, 50MW for Cloud and 10MW for Enterprise data centers on average. Overall data centers should represent less than 10% of total electricity demand growth by 2030 at the global level. To put things into context, this is roughly on a par with demand growth for desalination and less than the share from industrial motors, space cooling or electric vehicles. Growth is therefore rapid but the absolute level of data center electricity consumption remains relatively small in the global context (at least for now).

However, the key point is that data centers tend to be concentrated geographically . The importance of data centers varies a lot by country or even by region within that country. At the local level, grid constraints and power generation shortages can be significant. This is particularly true in the US. Virginia is by far the largest data center market in the world, with operational capacity at close to 6GW, equivalent to 25% of total capacity in the Americas. There are 6 other markets in the US that exceed 1GW in size. In Asia, Beijing is the second largest datacenter market at slightly above 2GW, followed by Shanghai, Tokyo and Singapore (>1GW). In Europe, London and Dublin are also in excess of 1GW.

Emerging markets typically see electricity consumption growth of 4-6%, almost irrespective of the data center segment ,which should account for 'only' 5% of their demand growth by 2030. On the other hand, in more advanced countries where electricity consumption had been stagnant in the prior decade, data centers should account for 20% of electricity demand growth by 2030. For the US alone, the share of data centers should exceed 50% of the additional electricity demand over the next five years.

From 2010 to 2020, data center electricity usage remained relatively stable even as data production surged from 2 to 64 zettabyte (ZB) over the same period as efficiency gains largely offset the demand for energy. A study by Siddik et al. (2021) shows that US data center computing workloads increased by nearly 550% while energy use increased by only 6% over 2010-2018 thanks to progress in chip design and fabrication and cooling techniques. However, there has been a shift beginning in 2020 as the rate of technical efficiency gains has flattened. After a decade of substantial technical efficiency improvements and with more energy-intensive workloads for AI, data center electricity demand is now expected to nearly double by 2030 under the IEA's central scenario although, of course, the exact scale of the increase depends on future technological advances in both IT and hardware equipment.

More data has been generated in the past 3 years than in all of history. At the same time, the complexity of processing tasks is rising. It is estimated that AI tools like ChatGPT consume around 10x more energy than search engines like Google. As AI-generated images and video proliferate, the power required could keep growing exponentially.

Since 2020, the average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of data centers has been essentially flat and data center energy demand has started to re-align with growth in data generation. The PUE is a metric used to determine the energy efficiency of a data center. It is calculated by dividing the total amount of power used by a data center by the power used for computing. Lower PUEs (i.e. as close as possible to 1x) indicate more efficient data center operations with less energy wasted on cooling and infrastructure. Average PUE trended down from 2.0x in 2010 to around 1.5x in recent years. Early improvements in PUE drove significant gains thanks to containment systems and optimized airflow management, but further enhancements now require more complex solutions, with diminishing returns. The rise of AI also requires more energy-intensive workloads and more radical changes

in cooling techniques (e.g. liquid cooling solutions) to reduce the corresponding increase in heat and energy consumption. Best-in class players such as Google and Microsoft already achieve PUEs in the 1.1-1.2 range and the EU's revised Energy Efficiency Directive set a PUE target for new data centers of 1.2x in cool climates and 1.3x in warm climates. Retrofitting older data centers can, however, be expensive and challenging. According to the IRA, following the 2015-2024 trendline, the average data center PUE would decrease to around 1.43 by 2030. Even if we bring down the average PUE to 1.3x by 2030 in a best-case scenario this would reduce data center energy consumption by around 85TWh or only 9%. PUE improvements alone cannot offset the exponential surge in data production.

Source : Uptime Institute Compute technology improvements are a bigger driver of potential energy demand reduction. For example, Nvidia claims that its Blackwell GPUs can train AI models four times faster, improve AI inference performance by 30 times and do it with up to 25 times better energy efficiency than NVIDIA's previous generation, Hopper. As the next edition in the Blackwell platform, Nvidia also recently introduced the Blackwell Ultra NVL72 system, which is ramping up in 2H25. According to the group, this rack-scale system connects 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs + 36 Grace CPUs to act as a single GPU and delivers 1.5x the AI

inference performance of Blackwell (B300 contains 288GB HBM content, vs. 192GB in B200). In a white paper called "Bending the Energy Curve", Schneider introduced the concept of ICT performance factor which provides a means of quantifying the ITC energy consumption per unit of data generated (TWh/ZB). According to the group, based on data generation and energy forecasts, the ICT performance factor is expected to improve from 0.92 TWh/ZB in 2020 to 0.45 TWh/ZB by 2030 via continuing advancements in GPUs, TPU, memory performance and more optimal resource utilization. If further reduced to 0.3TWh/ZB, this could reduce data center energy consumption by 14%, or 153TWh. Of course, a beneficial side-effect of lower IT energy is a decrease in the physical infrastructure energy to support the IT.

A key question is whether electricity demand will materially de-couple from data center growth once again? With AI tasks becoming increasingly complex and diffusing in all aspects of the economy, we don't see this happening before the end of the decade. The table below shows expected trends in the overall electricity consumption and the rising contribution from data centers, particularly in the US.

The IEA expects global electricity demand to increase at a CAGR of 4% over 202527, continuing at the fast pace already seen in 2024 (+4.3%) and well above 2023 (+2.5%), which was impacted by declines in mature economies. At the global level, electricity demand growth is generally associated with population growth and economic growth, as well as rising demand for air conditioning and industrial production expansion. In mature economies, electricity demand has been stagnant or even down slightly over the past 15 years due to energy efficiency measures being implemented (for example in lighting), slow industrial production growth and the shift of energy-intensive heavy industries to emerging markets. However, electricity demand is now on the rise again, fuelled by the trend towards more pervasive electrification in all aspects of the economy with the deployment of electric vehicles, air conditioners, heat pumps and, more importantly, data centers.

Power demand is on the rise again in the US. In the US, electricity demand rebounded with 3% growth in 2024 following a decline of 1.6% in 2023 (in part due to mild weather conditions). As shown in the chart below, this marks a return to growth rates not seen since the mid-2000s.

Over the past few years, IEA's estimates have been gradually revised upwards with a CAGR of 2% now forecasted out to 2027, largely because of rising consumption from data centers. Similarly, 2024 FERC filings show that US energy demand is now expected to reach 4,773 TWh in 2029, up from 4,242 TWh in 2024. This is 398 TWh or 9% higher than was assumed in 2022 FERC filings.

The 5-year national forecast for peak demand in the US increased each year from 2022 to 2024 , with the CAGR out to 2029 rising from 0.6% to 1.6% (as filed). Including forecast updates from fast-growing planning areas, a recent study from Grid Strategies shows that the national forecast is now closer to a 3% CAGR. In particular, ERCOT's is now forecast to grow at 8.7% p.a., including additional contractually agreed loads and "officer letter" loads (large loads without a signed contract). This is a substantial increase from the prior 2024 forecast of 1.4% p.a.

In their Long-term Reliability Assessment published in December 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) anticipates that US electricity demand will increase by 1.7% on average annually over 2024-2034 with increased peak demand of 132-149GW, mainly fueled by data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities. Specifically, the US Department of Energy estimates that data center electricity consumption rose from 60 TWh in 2014 to 176 TWh in 2023, which represents more than 4% of today's electricity use in the country. The DoE's various scenarios indicate that it could rise to between 325TWh and 580 TWh by 2028, then accounting for 7% to 12% of total US electricity demand. This also means that data center consumption growth could represent nearly 50% of the total electricity consumption growth in the US over that same period of time. Figure 14: Estimated drivers of change in electricity demand in the United States, 2024 vs. 2021

Europe's electricity demand is also on a recovery mode. In the European Union, electricity demand recovered in 2024, growing by 1.4%, but remains low by historical standards, after falling by 3.3% in 2023 and 2.8% in 2022. The decline in prior years was driven by lower industrial demand (around -6% in both 2022 and 2023) reflecting high energy prices and a slump in manufacturing activity. In 2024, growth came from data centers, heat pumps and EVs while cooling and heating demand was lower due to mild weather. Over 2025-27, the IEA projects electricity consumption growth of 1.7% on average. Electrification trends in the transport and heating sectors continue, but some slowing was felt last year with the stock of EVs and heat pumps growing at a slower pace.

Regionally, 85% of the additional demand for electricity is still expected to come from emerging markets , with both China and India forecasted to increase on average by c.6% annually. China alone should contribute to more than half the expected growth in global electricity demand through 2027 with the share of electricity in its final energy consumption at 28%, already higher than in the US (22%) or Europe (21%), driven by electricity-intensive sectors such as the manufacturing of solar PV modules, batteries and electric vehicles. The IEA estimates that data centers consumed 100TWh of electricity in China in 2024, or just 1% of total electricity demand. Electricity consumption by data centers in

China should double by 2027, while accounting for c6% of the additional electricity demand. In its China Power Industry Annual Development Report 2024, the China Electricity Council estimated that the combined electricity demand of data centers and 5G networks will reach 1,200TWh by 2030. Adjusted for networks, this could imply nearly 1,000TWH for data centers alone. Figure 15: Evolution of per capita electricity consumption and GDP in selected regions throughout the years, 1990-2027

Data centers are the factories of AI and, as a result, suppliers to the data center market are big winners from the deployment of AI in the economy. Data centers need the most reliable and energy efficient architectures, with improvements required at both the hardware and software levels to help reduce the energy use. Furthermore, the buildout of AI data centers will only materialize if there is enough available power and grid infrastructure capable of serving it. Within our universe of EU Capital Goods companies, key beneficiaries include Schneider, Legrand, ABB and Siemens in the low and medium voltage electrical equipment market, Siemens Energy in the grid and gas turbine markets, as well as Prysmian and Nexans in the cables market. And in the US, key beneficiaries include Vertiv, Eaton, and nVent in the electrical equipment and cooling markets, along with GE Vernova in the grid and gas turbine markets.

Legrand sizes the data center market opportunity at ~€70bn (o/w 70% in the grey room and 30% in the white space) and expects the market to grow at a low-teens CAGR until 2030. Vertiv also expects the data center market to grow at a 10-13% CAGR over 2024-29, including a 15-17% CAGR for cloud & colocation and a 4-6% CAGR for enterprise and distribution IT segments. Of note, even if growth rates in the data center sector were to gradually moderate, our companies' average exposure to this segment is now approximately twice what it was five years ago.

We see Schneider as the global market leader, with a particularly strong position in the power train for data centers (LV and MV switchgears/switchboards, UPS, busbars, transfer switches, etc). The group also has best-in class DCIM (software) solutions and a strong service franchise. It also recently acquired a 75% stake in Motivair, a leading player in the liquid cooling space with Coolant Distribution Units (CDUs), Cold Plates, Heat Dissipation Units (HDUs) and Rear Door Heat Exchangers (RDHx) offerings. Schneider had around €6.5bn of revenues derived from data centers in 2024. We estimate that the group's comprehensive product offering and ability to provide integrated solutions for data centers are rather unique, which enables it to engage in new project designs with hyperscalers at a very early stage, subsequently securing customer commitments on volumes for periods of 2-3 years.

Vertiv is the second largest vendor with 85% exposure to the data center market and revenues nearly on par with those of Schneider. The group expects to grow at a CAGR of 12-14% over 2024-29 and achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of around 25% by 2029, up from 19.4% in 2024. Specifically for 2025, Vertiv guided for organic growth of 24%, accelerating from 14% in 2024, with Americas growth in the mid30s, APAC in the low-20s and EMEA flat. Vertiv revenues are relatively well balanced between the power train and the thermal train for data centers, including a leading position in thermal management according to Dell'Oro analysis.

Eatonderived $4.3bn of revenue from the data center & distributed IT segment in 2024, making it the third largest player globally behind Schneider and Vertiv, with strong positions in circuit protection, power distribution and back-up power. Eaton covers both the gray and white spaces, but is not active in cooling. Eaton estimates that its content covers 6-14% of total compute and infrastructure capex for AI data centers.

Legrand's data center business had revenues of around €1.8bn in 2024, growing by c.50% in H1 2025 and now representing 24% of group sales. Legrand's current addressable market is only €11bn but this number has been steadily growing in recent years thanks to acquisitions in new segments like transceivers, consoles and liquid cooling solutions. Today, Legrand's DC business is mainly exposed to North America (66% of revenues) and to the white space (80% of revenues). We calculate the group holds a market share of around 20% in the categories in which it is active, with leading positions in smart PDUs, open track busways and cable trays. Legrand should pursue further inorganic growth opportunities within the data center sector, including expanding its presence outside the US and in the grey space, building upon the recent acquisition of Davenham.

Other European players (Siemens and ABB) are mainly exposed to the grey space, and unlike Schneider/Vertiv, they are not active in the cooling segment. Both companies are relatively new entrants to the data center vertical, yet they have demonstrated exceptionally high growth rates in recent years. As traditional vendors to the data center market approached full capacity, hyperscalers

proactively sought out new suppliers, creating opportunities for companies capable of fulfilling orders with shorter delivery times. Both Siemens and ABB have successfully redirected the supply of low voltage and medium voltage equipment from other verticals to the data center market. Siemens Smart Infrastructure grew its data center revenues by c.50% in FY2024 to around €2bn (equivalent to 3% of group), with orders even higher at €3.6bn, driven by hyperscalers (60% of its mix). ABB derives 6% of group revenues from data centers (€1.8bn). While still a small player in the overall UPS market, we estimate that ABB's investment in mediumvoltage UPS technology will increasingly pay off as switching from low voltage to medium voltage for the UPS system and power distribution and running operations with higher voltage should enable data centers to scale more efficiently with fewer parts and cabling and with lower conversion losses.

nVent's Data Solutions business comprises ~20% of company sales, amounting to ~$750m of revenue as of 2025 . The company supplies liquid cooling solutions, racks, power distribution/connection equipment, cable pathway, and bracing solutions to market participants.

Key DC market drivers include: n The speed and scale of AI deployment acceleration. Vertiv estimates that today's data center compute mix represents an opportunity of $2.7-3.5m per MW of IT power, including $2.5-3m for traditional compute and $33.5m for high density compute. n Increasing complexity in requirements, with a mixing of traditional and AI high-density workloads and redundancy in power and thermal designs for optionality; n Digital sovereignty and associated workload allocation. New data center hubs are now under development globally, not just in the US. Following a difficult start to the year in Europe, Schneider recently commented its pipeline has developed positively in the region, in particular in France. - n Greenfield remains primary deployment means. Brownfield growth presents pre-fab solutions and service opportunities.

As GPUs consume more energy, new IT investment cycles push for higher server rack power densities. Densification roadmaps point to extreme peak rack densities of 1MW+, resulting in estimated new build average rack density increasing across varying workload applications and market segments. Legrand estimates that 40% of racks will have >20kW capacity by 2027, up from 5% in 2019.

The market for cooling solutions is set to experience particularly strong growth, with liquid cooling seen growing at a CAGR of 30%+. Major players include Schneider, Vertiv, nVent, Legrand, Rittal, CoolIT Systems, Boyd, Green Revolution Cooling, Fujitsu, Chilldyne, LiquidCool Solutions, etc. Around 40% of a data center's energy consumption comes from cooling. Energy cannot disappear, meaning that one server receiving 1kW of power input will equal 1 kW of heat generated at some point. Data centers need to remove this excess heat to operate at peak performance and efficiency. IT cooling challenges are, however, continuously increasing as machine learning and AI drive ever-rising rack power densities. While the use of air cooling is still mainstream today, we are now reaching the limits of the physics of airflow for new AI-dedicated data centers, with rack power densities of more than 20kW.

The latest generation of graphics processing units (GPUs) has much higher thermal density properties than previous ones, with the latest blackwell chips reaching 1,200W. In addition, server manufacturers are packing more CPUs and GPUs into each rack to meet accelerating demand for high-performance computing and AI applications. In large AI clusters, densities can now range from 40 kW to 100 kW depending on the GPU model and quantities. Traditional air cooling can't cool highdensity racks efficiently, with 20-30KW generally seen as the physical limit, with hybrid (RHDx) or liquid solutions required above that. Liquid conducts heat far better than air and is a more efficient way to absorb excess heat as it consumes less energy than air cooling. Water or other fluids have higher thermal transfer properties and, therefore, have a much greater capacity to capture heat by unit volume. This is why, for high-density racks, data center operators are now investing in liquid cooling solutions, which appear to be more efficient and cost-effective.

Figure 23: Liquid cooling versus air cooling Options for liquid cooling include: Rear-door heat exchangers (RDHx) Passive or active heat exchangers replace the rear door of the IT equipment rack with a liquid heat exchanger. Think of radiator-like doors attached to the back of racks but acting like fridges. These systems can be used in conjunction with air-cooling systems to cool environments with mixed rack densities. They can be integrated into traditional architectures, with no need to replace the entire systems in order to support high-density racks. RDHxs are costeffective solutions for existing air-cooled data centers looking for a liquid cooling strategy for medium- to high-density applications. For example, Legrand has developed a rear door heat exchanger that can cool up to 200KW in a single rack through a close loop water circuit. It can be fitted to standard racks, occupies a small footprint and is easy to install and roll out. Legrand estimates that more

complex technologies such as direct-to-chip and immersion cooling are niche markets and will remain so for a long time given their prohibitive cost. Direct-to-chip liquid cooling Direct-to-chip (DTC) cooling circulates liquid coolant through a network of pipes. When the fluid reaches the cold plates that are in direct contact with the hot components (GPUs, CPUs), it soaks up excess heat. The now-warm liquid then flows to a heat exchanger, which transfers heat away from the liquid (typically to a water loop connected to a heat rejection system). With the heat dissipated, the liquid goes back to the equipment to repeat the cycle. This solution requires several pieces of specialised equipment:

n Coolant Distribution Units (CDUs) regulate the coolant's temperature and flow, ensuring efficiency. n In-rack manifolds distribute the coolant to each cold plate, providing leakproof connections for easy maintenance. n Cold plates are mounted directly on the hot spots (CPUs and GPUs). The liquid coolant flows over the cold plate and draws heat away from these components. Direct-to-chip cooling provides higher cooling efficiency than rear-door heat exchangers but also requires high upfront investment in specialised equipment such as CDUs and cooling infrastructure to circulate the liquid to each individual component (CPU, GPU). It can remove 70-75% of the heat generated by the equipment in the rack, leaving 25-30% that must be removed by air-cooling systems.

Immersion cooling Immersion cooling systems submerge servers and other components in the rack in dielectric fluids which eliminate the risk of water leaks within the servers. The coolant absorbs heat from all parts, not just specific components, and carries it away to a heat exchanger located outside the immersion tank. This approach maximises the thermal transfer properties of liquid and is the most energy-efficient form of liquid cooling on the market as it eliminates air cooling. In contrast, direct-to-chip only cools individual components and still require supplemental traditional cooling for the rest of the equipment. Currently, direct-to-chip is still the preferred choice, as it has better compatibility with existing air cooling and is easier for retrofit applications. Immersion cooling also often uses fluorocarbons as dielectric fluids due to their heat transfer performance but fluorcarbons also have have global warming potentials.

Power constraints are already challenging the build-out of data centers in some countries . For example, in Ireland, the percentage of metered electricity consumption by data centers increased from 5% in 2015 to 21% in 2023, forcing Dublin to place a moratorium on new data center projects until 2028 due to grid capacity limitations and concerns around energy consumption. Constraints on power availability have also led to restrictions on data center construction in Singapore and parts of Virginia. The AI revolution will only take place if there is enough available electrical power and if the grid infrastructure is capable of serving it. The risk of power shortages is well understood in the US. For example, American Electric Power (AEP) expects to interconnect 24 GW of new load by 2030, up approximately 15% from its previous

estimate, with 18 GW coming from data centers. This is a significant increase for a 37 GW summer peak load system and is further backed by requests about possible new load totaling 190 GW in various stages of development. AEP plans to increase its five-year capital spending plan by 30% to about $70bn, up from $54bn, with transmission investments accounting for half the additional expenditures, followed by generation at 40% and distribution at 10%. Gas turbines are expected to exceed 60% of the group's generation additions in GW over 2025-34. The demand for new gas generation is back. The global gas turbine market has surged to approximately 85GW this year, more than doubling in 5 years. Lead times have increased to levels not seen since the gas boom of the early 2000s. Power demand is a looming bottleneck, which creates significant growth opportunities for gas turbine vendors ENR and GEV.

The first data centers built by hyperscalers were plugged into the grid with longterm Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with IPPs and utilities and using a simple backup generator, typically driven by diesel. New AI-dedicated data centers (at scale easily exceeding 100 MW) not only consume much more power but they also need better backup power solutions, in part because the data centers themselves represent a challenge to the grid system. Aeroderivative gas turbines are modular, easy to install and fuel flexible. According to GEV, a typical single LM2500XPRESS aero unit with around 35MW can replace 11 or 12 diesel generator sets, saving on real estate, switchgears and transformers.

Aero or gas turbines can also support the grid when not serving data center needs as they can maintain synchronous inertia in the system, which reduces the risk of a black-out. That's because renewables and battery energy storage technologies behave differently from synchronous sources when facing short circuit, loss or increase of loads situations, which decreases the reliability of the grid. Hence maintaining synchronous resources and providing ancillary services such as those shown in the figure below are growing in value. Figure 24: Examples of the types of ancillary services that aeroderivative gas turbines can support Source : GEV Shift towards behind-the-meter power generation

There has been a recent shift towards behind-the-meter generation for new data center infrastructure (i.e. with a dedicated power facility at the point of consumption). T raditional grid connections have increasingly been facing capacity constraints, typically where there is already high data center concentration. More data center customers are now building onsite power generation to deliver more reliable and continuous power to the data center. A few years ago, data center projects of 200-500MW were rare, but they have now become more common with AI coming into play. So, heavy-duty gas turbines have the critical mass needed to run AI data centers entirely off the grid. Onsite power generation can help reduce the pressure on grid infrastructure , although it does not reduce the electricity consumption in the system. This is where the re-use of waste heat comes into play to reduce data centers' net impact on the overall energy consumption. For example, Siemens Energy offers solutions to use the excess heat generated by data centers, including connecting data centers to district heating networks and utilizing it for on-site heating and cooling.

The quantity of power needed to support the deployment of AI data centers may be difficult to obtain due to lack of generation, scheduled closure of coal plants, fully subscribed transmission lines, and long lead times for high voltage and medium voltage transmission equipment such as switchgears, static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs), transformers, and other critical grid infrastructure equipment. Many equipment supply chains can stretch up to 36 months and longer. The wait time for smaller gas turbines is not as long as for large ones, making them more appealing; ENR is benefiting from the breadth of its portfolio in terms of frame sizes. Among the smaller units (<100 MW), ENR's SGT-800 is the top-selling model.

Speed of execution is one of the reasons behind the recent partnership between Eaton and Siemens Energy. The 2 groups decided to join forces to accelerate the delivery of new data center capacity with grid-independent energy supplies and standardized modular power systems. The package aims to reduce the time-tomarket by up to 2 years by enabling simultaneous construction of data centers and associated on-site power generation. The standard configuration generates 500 MW of electricity, based on Siemens Energy's SGT-800 gas turbines, with a modular approach so that the size of the plant can be easily scaled up and down. The plant design is built with redundancy, eliminating the need for backup diesel generators. Eaton will provide customers with electrical equipment such as medium voltage switchgear, low voltage switchgear, UPS, busways, structural support, racks and containment systems.

Pricing dynamics have been very positive for gas turbines. Data center customers tend to prioritize shorter delivery times over price, creating temporary periods of inflated pricing in the US market. For deliveries beyond 2028, the market appears more rational, with relatively consistent pricing levels across customer segments and regions. The CEO of GEV commented during recent roadshows that gas turbine prices have continued to increase, and there is no price ceiling to speak of. This would require a viable alternative baseload power source, which SMRs may become in the next decade, but not in this one. In total, a gas turbine used to cost $1,200-1,400/kW, but this looks more like $2,400/kW today, and the equipment continues to represent ~30% of the total cost (EPCs have also increased prices).

Given the strength of the market, GEV, ENR and MHI are all planning gas turbine production capacity increases of around 30%. GEV is ramping to 80 units of HDGT production/year vs. 55 today; management expects to be at full rate production of this new capacity by July 2026. ENR is also ramping to 40-50 units of large gas turbines, up from 35 currently, and to 70-80 units of medium-sized gas turbines, up from 50. This should enable the group to ship approximately 20 GW of gas turbines annually from 2028 onwards, up from around 15 GW this year. Both GEV and ENR remain reluctant to consider incremental new capacity beyond this; this decision would require an order book that extends five years into the future and current/ future production certified from a lean perspective. As of now, the order book is totally full for 2026-27 and 2028 is filling rapidly. GEV believes that the ~20% downpayment required to make a slot reservation keeps double ordering at bay.

Globally, the market for gas turbines (>10MW) amounted to 41.5 GW and 393 units in H1'25, 37% and 2x higher on a year-on-year basis, respectively. The added capacity in GW was the highest 6-month mark on record while the added units were the highest since H1'11. GEV, ENR and MHI control 75% of the gas turbine market in unit terms and 90% in value terms. Over 2000-2024, GEV led the market with volumes of 75GW and share of 33%. MHI was second at 61 GWe and 27% share, while ENR was a close number 3 with a share of nearly 25%. ENR has recently been gaining share and for the 6M'25 period, it reached the top spot at 16.6 GW and 40% share; GE was second at 11.4 GW with a 27% share.

- n In Q2'25, GE Vernova bagged 5GW of new orders and shipped 5GW of equipment, resulting in the backlog remaining at 29GW, same as in Q1. The group also grew slot reservation agreements from 21GW to 25GW, which will enter the backlog once customers have reached certain steps like obtaining permits for the installation sites. One-third of these reservations are for data center customers. In total, GEV had nearly 55GW between backlog and reservation agreements at the end of June, up from 50GW at the end of April and still expects to have at least 60GW by the end of the year "at better margins with significant momentum into 2026". GEV continues to see higher turbine prices, as wait times are rising. The group indicated that it is already in discussion with some customers about fulfilling orders for delivery in 2030. Strong power demand isn't limited to gas new units. GEV also sees solid services demand growth as customers look to invest in their existing fleets.

- n In the same quarter, Siemens Energy booked 9GW of new gas turbine orders (half from the US), including 3GW with data center customers. At the end of June, the group had a total commitment of 58GW, including 37GW of backlog (up from 29GW in the prior quarter) and 21GW of reservation agreements (stable QoQ). Overall, the current delivery rate of 14-15GW p.a. implies that visibility on new units is now 4 years. Management indicated that the favorable pricing trend should continue across all frames in the foreseeable future. It also confirmed that 20GW gas power plants are planned under the German Infrastructure bill over the next few years.

One interesting debate in the tech circles is whether agentic AI will disrupt the SaaS model. The CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella himself commented that AI could replace the business logic that SaaS applications provide and that "once the AI tier becomes the place where all the logic is, then people will start replacing the back ends". In our coverage universe, Siemens and Schneider have the highest exposure to software and have been transitioning to SaaS over the past few years. As discussed previously, Agentic AI refers to AI systems that are designed to learn from their environment, take actions and act autonomously. Their ability to automate workflows, connect different systems, and deliver results without user intervention could pose a direct challenge to some of the SaaS vendors. If the objective is to use an AI agent to replace an employee, then the employee is no longer the user of the SaaS application but the AI agent is. The AI agent can directly interface with the underlying data of the application, which would make the SaaS User Interface (buttons, menu, etc) become largely irrelevant. Software has

historically been designed around human users that enter data. With AI, software no longer needs to be built around people and no longer needs access through screens, so legacy user interfaces will be replaced. The business models of many software companies are built on charging customers a fee for each user of the software. If AI agents replace employees, there would be fewer users of SaaS applications. Software companies will therefore need to shift their per-seat revenue models towards outcomes or results rather than the number of software users. For existing software solutions which are being enriched by AI tools, the pricing model could also shift to a model based on the consumption of tokens. Monetizing of AI agents is not easy currently and the trend could be disruptive for some vendors, however spending from enterprises on software could become higher than in the past as AI agents allow software companies to replace works and therefore tap into the labour spending pool, which is bigger than the software budget.

With AI, coding is also becoming more and more automated, which could put pressure on developers' salaries, reduce barriers to entry, commoditize the traditional software sector and eventually drive price deflation in the software industry. DB software analysts however argue that the AI trend rather enables software companies to cut costs and improve margins, as we see with SAP currently. LLMs have not had the chance to be trained on niche private data sets. So that's where the marginal gains will come to compete vs. a traditional SaaS product. Industrial software companies like Siemens and Schneider have access to vast amounts of enterprise data.

The energy system is shifting towards electricity, with demand from data centers creating incremental support. Last year, for the first time, capex of global utilities was larger than that of the O&G industry. Siemens Energy (ENR) is ideally positioned to benefit from the ongoing investment supercycle in the electric power system. Stronger electricity consumption growth, high replacement needs due to an ageing base and the energy transition continue to require massive investments in power generation and transmission. According to the IEA, global investments into the grid should double through 2030. Electricity demand growth in developed markets, which has been largely flat for 2 decades, is now expected to grow by more than 2% annually. In the US specifically, data centers are expected to account for half of the country's electricity demand growth over the next five years, creating unprecedented demand for gas turbines.

The average project margin in the group's backlog continues to increase. Pricing dynamics remain positive in Gas. Data center customers continue to prioritize shorter delivery times over price, creating temporary periods of inflated pricing in the US market. In Grid, prices are on average rather flat including a better pricing environment in the US and some normalization in Europe, after two years of significant price increases in new orders. Some of these price increases have yet to be reflected in the P&L, which should continue to support margins in the coming years. Beyond pricing, productivity improvements remain a key focus, with management identifying significant cost optimization opportunities in Grid.

At the CMD in November we anticipate that management will lift its revenue CAGR objective to low teens and raise its FY28 adjusted EBITA margin objective by 2pts to 12-14%. In conjunction with a strategic refocus on electrification, the group may also announce its intention to spin or sell its Compression business (revenue of €2.5bn, with a margin of 14%), largely eliminating its exposure to the Oil&Gas/ petrochemical sector. This would also allow the group to simplify its reporting structure, potentially reallocating the electrolyzer and steam turbine businesses to the Gas division (to form a new "Power" division similar to that of GEV) and reclassifying the EAD solution business to the Grid division. Any action that brings ENR's profile closer to that of GEV should be viewed positively by investors.

GEV's premium valuation (2026e EV/EBITDA of 27x vs ENR at 13x) should continue to provide support as ENR executes on the turnaround plan of Gamesa. The discount looks less and less justified as ENR should continue to grow revenues at a faster pace than GEV through 2028 (>10% CAGR), in part due to its higher exposure to the Grid business (30% of revenue, c.20% CAGR), in part due to market share gains in Gas. In H1'25, ENR's market share in the global gas turbine market reached 40% (up from 24% in 2024), while that of GE dropped to 27% from 38% over the same period. Furthermore, on a 12m rolling basis (June-end), ENR's Grid business achieved an organic revenue growth of 30% with a margin of 14.8% on a 12m rolling basis, well above GEV's 18% growth and 11.4% margin.

We like Legrand's resilient business model, with its high and steady margins, bestin class pricing power and superior FCF generation capabilities. The group's M&A strategy is also an integral part of the group's model which doubles the group's growth potential and is particularly value-creative.

Legrand's organic growth guidance of 5-7% appears conservative in light of the 9% growth recorded in H1. This implies a growth rate of only 3% at the mid-point in H2. Management has indicated that the basis for comparison will be more challenging in H2, which is accurate in terms of volume growth, as H2'24 was 6%-pts higher than H1'24. However, tariff-related price increases are now flowing through, with June prices exceeding those of May and April. For the FY, the group anticipates price increases to reach 2%, with a contribution of 3-4% in H2 following only 0.6% in H1. We anticipate that the group will further raise its growth outlook to 6-8% in conjunction with the Q3 release, with DB already at the upper end of that range.

Data centers accounted for 24% of H1'25 revenue, up from 20% last year. Over the past few years, the group has built up leading positions in specific product categories tailored to the white rooms (PDUs, busways, racks, liquid cooling). These investments are now yielding substantial returns, enabling Legrand to achieve stronger growth rates compared to other vendors in the electrification sector thus far this year. We expect the group will grow 30-35% for the full-year, well ahead of management's indication for 20-25% growth. The white room is where the servers/racks are located and is being transformed by the AI build-up, thus offering more opportunities to differentiate and to enjoy retrofit activities in the longer run, which should extend the cycle for Legrand versus some of its peers that are more focused on the grey room.

Legrand assumes zero growth outside data centers in 2025. There are however early signs of improvement in the EU residential market, including a return to growth for both building permits and mortgages. In France specifically, the number of housing transactions is now slightly up and the trend in housing starts has turned positive.

Despite challenging market conditions in the buildings market, Legrand has delivered a margin between 20.4% and 21.0% over the last 5 years, already in excess of its mid-term 20% margin ambition. At this stage the CFO sees no reason to change the financial framework, mainly because of potentially more dilutive M&A in the future. We however estimate that, if the EU building market bottoms out in 2026, the group will enjoy stronger than ever operating leverage, with positive mix dynamics leading to another step-up in profitability - a pattern observed previously when the group emerged from prior construction-related downturns. Wit this report, we increase our TP to €145 from €144 previously.

The stock is down 5% YTD and has significantly underperformed its electrical peers in both Europe (Legrand, ABB, Siemens) and the US (Eaton, Vertiv). This can be attributed to the absence of positive EPS revisions and disappointing margin momentum over the past 12 months, with the market factoring in a probability that the group will fall short of its stated margin outlook in 2025. We however expect that the group will reassure on margins with the upcoming CMD likely to bring a greater focus on cost discipline. We also anticipate that organic growth will surprise on the upside in Q3 (at circa 10%, an increase of 2pts vs Q2, primarily due to pricing actions). The stock currently trades at a small discount to its direct electrical competitors, which appears unjustified given the company's undisputed market leadership in electrification, one-stop-shop profile for data centers and stronger software franchise.

Schneider plans to host a new CMD in London on December 11. We estimate that the group's financial targets will remain largely unchanged - specifically a 7-10% organic revenue CAGR and organic margin expansion of around 50bps per annum, on average, by 2027. However, we anticipate more detailed information on how these targets will be achieved, likely through a more structured program. The CEO already indicated that he will put a greater emphasis on productivity and SG&A optimization. This heightened focus on productivity is positive news as we previously felt that the group was beginning to lose some of its cost discipline; however, this concern is now being addressed, which strengthens our confidence in the group's margin momentum for 2026.

Schneider offers one of the most attractive growth profiles in our universe, given its increasingly synergetic portfolio of electrification (therein 20% exposure to data centers), automation and software solutions. >70% of group revenue are derived from energy, climate and resource efficiency solutions, which grow twice as fast as the overall industrial demand. Risks of power shortages and grid constraints create a sense of urgency amongst customers to speed up investments in electrification while rising electricity prices should further reduce payback times for the group's energy efficiency solutions. Software and services account for 19% of sales. Adding products with connectivity features (32%) and edge control solutions (9%), data-based revenue represents circa 60% of group revenue. Unique to Schneider's digital strategy is the integration of energy efficiency software and process efficiency software under one roof which allows a reduction in both resource consumption and carbon emissions. With this report, we increase our TP to €250 from €240 previously.

Prysmian is the market leader in wire and cable production, having grown through a series of acquisitions that have proven to be highly synergistic. Nearly half of its EBITDA is now generated in the US, where margins are much higher and mega trends in electrification are accentuated. Having made two large acquisitions in the past year, Prysmian's portfolio is now well positioned to capture the market opportunity in grid modernization and expansion, as well as the ramp-up of data centers. Prysmian also remains the dominant player in the attractive European market for high-voltage subsea cables, with capacity in the segment nearly fully booked until 2029, underpinning its very strong growth profile (DBe 16% 2024-28 adj. EBITA CAGR).

Prysmian's portfolio across high, medium and low voltage power cables stands to benefit from the increased energy demand that data centers create, particularly in the US, as the grid needs to be expanded and revamped to facilitate a greater energy throughput. More directly, Prysmian also sells cables to be used at data centers (primarily fire-safe low voltage building wire and fiber optic data cables), the contribution of which is set to nearly double this year to over €1bn (>5% of group sales), from c.€600m last year. With residential demand in the US remaining soft, and non-resi demand having come under pressure due to tariffs, data centers have been the driver of growth for its low voltage segment (I&C). Within Digital Solutions (data cables), data centers account for nearly half of the volumes for fiber optic cables. A rebound in the fiber to the home market in the US is also helping demand here, with Prysmian continuing to utilize its European capacity to capture share

(the 15% import tariff should be absorbed by the much higher margins). Notably, the recently announced acquisition of CommScope's telecom cables business by Amphenol for $11.5bn or c.11.2x FY25 EBITDA further validates Prysmian's recent acquisition of Channell in the US (for c.8x EBITDA). Channell's EBITDA margins remain at 35% and is set to increase Digital Solutions' margins closer to 20% in the upcoming quarters as the business is consolidated, and as Prysmian benefits from a more comprehensive data center offer in the US.

Although the US market for high-voltage subsea transmission might be dormant until further notice, the US offers attractive growth in HVAC and MV cables for power transmission and distribution, LV cables for buildings and fiber optic cables and solutions for fiber-to-home and data centers. Prysmian is ideally positioned in all of these areas, especially after having acquired Encore Wire, making it a virtual duopoly in low voltage, with Prysmian and Southwire holding a combined 60% market share in the country (DBe). The consolidated nature of the market also means that margins are much higher, particularly in the case of building cables where US margins are at 15%+, nearly double the level seen in Europe. The acquisition of Channell's portfolio of connectivity solutions complements Prysmian's portfolio of fiber optic cables in the US, allowing the company to

provide a more comprehensive offer and capture more of the market opportunity in data centers. The acquisition of Encore Wire also gave it a very large vertically integrated plant in McKinney, Texas, which allows the company to consolidate much of its LV operations in the US, and provide an unparalleled level of service with delivery leads times as low as 1-2 days. Prysmian is also investing in a MV facility in McKinney to further drive synergies and support cross-selling opportunities.

All of the cables Prysmian sells in the US are manufactured in the US. 50% tariffs on copper and aluminum now apply to the metal content of imported cables. We estimate around 15% of copper cables and 40% of aluminum cables used in the US are imported. Meanwhile, much of the copper Prysmian uses for copper cables is sourced domestically, while we estimate around 40% of the aluminum rods it uses for its aluminum cables are imported. This allows domestic manufacturers such as Prysmian to take market share from importers through better pricing from Q3 onwards, while any demand destruction seen in the market due to tariff uncertainty should also now unwind. We estimate that around 27% of group sales

are associated with US copper cables (primarily in I&C, Specialties and HVAC), and around 12% of group sales are associated with US aluminum cables (primarily MV and aluminum building wire). At the Q2 stage, management sounded upbeat about the group's prospects in the US copper cable market on the back of the copper tariff announcement, signalling potential upside to its current FY guidance, while the inclusion of aluminum cables in the tariff list should provide additional support.

We forecast an EBITA CAGR of 16% over 2024-28, with over half of the EBITA expansion coming from the Transmission business (28% CAGR), underpinned by a near-record backlog giving it strong visibility. While our forecasts are in-line with the group's mid-term ambitions as we remain prudent on our assumptions for the more volatile areas (MV and LV), management recently hinted at potential upside to its mid term targets. Meanwhile, Prysmian trades at 13.2x EV/EBITA (2026e), a 25% discount to electrical peers (vs. an average historical discount of 18%). Key catalysts include 1/ Q3 results where there is upside to the current FY guidance driven by copper tariffs in the US, and 2/ a potential secondary listing in New York.

Nexans is currently at the tail end of its portfolio transformation as it turns into a pure player in power cables, where it sees growth and returns to be more attractive. It has divested most of its non-core assets and non-electrification revenues are down to c.10% of group revenues, while its exposure to the higher-value transmission segment has increased to 22% (on a proforma basis). The group now has over €2bn of firepower that will be redeployed towards a rich pool of targets in grid cables and building wires, which should prove to be synergistic as the company consolidates share and increases its exposure to higher margin accessories.

The cable contract for the portion of the Great Sea Interconnector linking the grids of Greece and Cyprus was awarded to Nexans in 2023, but the project has yet to receive a final notice to proceed due to geopolitical tensions with Turkey. GSI is a substantial project with a value of €1.43bn and margins of around 30%. Nexans has been executing on this project step by step as it continues to receive periodic payments. Nexans is yet to receive a payment to continue executing on the project beyond early September, although the mid-point of its FY25 guidance is now secure. Although the eventual fate of GSI remains unclear, Nexans provided more colour on potential mitigations should there be a cancellation, including a 'Plan B' where the cable is repurposed for a different project. We are of the view that a loss of GSI would see limited downside risks to earnings, as there is a high likelihood of a replacement project being found in the context of an industry where capacity is fully booked out to 2029, although there

could be a production gap of c.6-8 months. In a worst case scenario, where GSI is canceled in September, the earnings loss is not mitigated, and a suitable replacement is not found until end 2029, we estimate risks to our EBITDA forecasts are limited to 2% in FY25, 5% in FY26 and 10% annually over 2027-29. This corresponds to an NPV that is equivalent to €5 on Nexans' shares or 4% downside.

Nexans expects growth in its Grid and Connect segments to accelerate to doubledigits in Q3 and remain at a lower but still healthy level in Q4, after having posted +5.6% and +0.2% respectively in the first half. Growth in Grid is being driven by demand for grid expansion and modernization, connection of renewables and data centers. Meanwhile, Nexans expects growth in Connect to have reached a low point in Q2 (-1.4%) with certain European markets said to be picking up, while the group has already seen a strong performance in July. Delivery lead times are typically lower for this segment, but demand from data centers has improved forward visibility here as well. For context, Nexans guides for Grid and Connect to grow in the mid-single digit and low to mid-single digit range respectively in the

mid term, slower than the market, which is expected to grow at a 7% and 5% pace. By design, Nexans targets growth of 3-5% for its Electrification business (Transmission + Grid + Connect), a level it sees as optimal from a margin and cash generation standpoint. Therefore, it appears the market is coming to Nexans, suggesting strong margin potential and upside to mid term growth prospects.

Following a very good 1H performance at the Grid division (10% EBITDA beat and margin 110bps ahead), management now expect margins to reach a range of 15-

16.5% in the mid term, up from 13.7% last year, which in turn was up from as low as 6.7% in 2021. With concerns around industry overcapacity potentially pressuring margins at Grid, consensus expects a more flattish margin development, while we forecast a margin of c14.5% over the mid-term, noting potential upside as the company continues to grow its share of sales from accessories and other value added products that come with higher margins. Similarly, Connect has seen an equally impressive margin progression, and stands to continue to benefit from the SHIFT model (Nexans' business simplification strategy) as some units still operate at c.10% while others are at 20%. Notably, La Triveneta Cavi, acquired in June 2025, can improve its margin by 5pts by June 2026 as synergies kick in, representing a c€40m EBITDA uplift equivalent to 1.5pt on Connect's margin. As with Grid, consensus incorporate a more flattish development.

Despite the rally in July, Nexans continues to screen cheap at 9.2x 2026 EBITA, a nearly 30% discount to Prysmian (vs. -18% on avg historically) and a c.50% discount to leading electrification peers, despite having a comparable growth profile. We believe a gradual organic improvement in the company's margins, combined with margin-accretive M&A later this year and next, should lead to a rerating of the shares. A confirmation/cancellation of GSI should be a clearing event, largely de-risking the investment case. Aside from GSI and acquisitions, other catalysts for Nexans include: 1/ a disposal of the remaining non-electrification revenues (Auto Electric), 2/ transmission order wins, 3/ a pick up in the European residential market, and 4/ a ceasefire in Ukraine leading to an infrastructure rebuild. Key downside risks include delays in high-voltage project execution, potential overcapacity in medium-voltage, a material deterioration in demand growth for electricity, a

persistent slowdown in the construction market, delays in selling down its non-core assets and legal challenges associated with antitrust investigations.

Vertiv is a unique (nearly) pure-play data center equipment manufacturer offering a comprehensive range of technologies and services tailored to data centers, communication networks, and industrial environments with limited comparable competition in the MI/EE space. We view VRT as the best vehicle to gain exposure to future robust data center growth in our coverage universe. The combination of exposure to attractive secular end markets, impressive long-term order pipeline/ backlog, and top line/margin expansion potential makes the stock attractive at its current valuation. We believe there is still room for upside given no change to the medium-term robust data center growth trajectory (even though the stock has seen some near term pressure with some of the AI trade unwind).

We remain bullish on the data center end market, and Vertiv is the best way to gain exposure to this theme in our space (~85% sales exposure). At VRT's Investor Conference on November 18th (see here for our takeaways from the event), the company laid out a medium-term growth framework, including a 12-14% organic revenue CAGR (increasing from 8-11% previously), predicated on 9-12% growth in the data center space which we believe can grow >20% in 2025/26 to M-Tns in 2027. We continue to see the potential for a 20%+ organic revenue CAGR at VRT through 2027 (at least) in a blue-sky scenario.

Order/backlog sustainability continues to be top of mind for investors, but we believe the outlook remains strong. Note, in 2Q25 VRT announced their decision to cease disclosing quarterly orders/backlog as of 2026 which we view as a wise decision and in effect should cause less volatility for the stock on earnings day as orders can be lumpy on a quarterly basis (market is becoming bigger in absolute terms but also bigger in terms of the individual jobs; typically, these orders and the big data centers are done in chunks) and we don't think a single quarter changes the story. The more robust aforementioned revenue growth framework through 2029 is underpinned by continued strong order growth, which has averaged +22% Y/Y since 2Q25, and a record backlog of $8.5bn. Further, when looking at 2Q25 backlog vs. YE19 (pre-Covid pandemic levels) it comes in at 6.1x, which is the highest for

our group and represents 77% of NTM revenue. In 2Q25, orders came in at $3.2bn (+15% Y/Y, +11% Q/Q on an organic basis) vs. $2.7bn reported in 1Q25, a very strong result that exceeded investor expectations. Further, VRT recently reiterated that its order pipeline is strong, and in EMEA, while 2025 full year net sales are expected to be flat Y/Y, the company is seeing sequential growth in the orders pipeline, providing optimism for 2026 and beyond (underpinned by more conducive regulatory environment to AI infrastructure investment, reflected in customer discussions and pipelines).

In addition to superior top line growth potential, Vertiv has significant margin expansion potential. The company is focused on closing the gap between its own (high-teens) and peer (mid-20s) operating margins. At the company's recent investor day, it set forth a medium-term financial framework that included ~25% adj. operating margins by 2029 (previously 20%+ adj. operating margins between 2026-28) on the back of sustainably positive price/cost, fixed cost leverage, and productivity improvements. We view this as very achievable.

Vertiv trades at a 28x NTM P/E multiple, a 24% premium to the group median, but this is down from a recent high of 30x. Moreover, the stock looks much more attractive using a PEG ratio, given that we forecast ~25% earnings growth. Thus, we think an elevated multiple is justified, getting us to our price target of $167, and see a bit of room for further re-rating potential to 30x on our NTM earnings forecast. Risks include the inability to gain traction on operational initiatives aimed at closing the margin gap vs. peers; secular shifts in the data center industry; and exogenous factors (macroeconomic deterioration).

The path for the Gas Power business is robust, with reason to believe revenue growth should accelerate and margins should expand over the next several years. This is critical, as the Power segment comprises 52% of GEV revenue and most of current adj. EBITDA. There are a number of reasons to believe Power can drive attractive MSD+ organic growth moving forward - already evidenced by 7% organic growth in 2024 and 6-7% growth forecasted for 2025. We were encouraged to hear management say in meetings when we took them on the road that gas turbine prices have continued to increase, and there is no price ceiling to speak of. In total, a gas turbine used to cost $1,200-1,400/kW, but this looks more like $2,400/ kW today. Gas turbine orders have picked up in recent quarters, as increasing electricity consumption pressures existing grid infrastructure, requiring more baseload capacity. This is the case for both traditional utility customers and hyperscalers, and is not just a US dynamic; demand in the Middle East

is accelerating, as evidenced by the Saudi grid stabilization equipment synchronous condensers announcement. In 2Q25, Power orders grew 44%, led by gas power equipment nearly tripling Y/Y. Gas turbine order activity continued to accelerate, as GEV booked 47 GT orders (20 heavy-duty gas turbines, including 7 HA units, which was six more heavy duty units vs. 2Q24 and secured orders for 27 aeroderivative units vs. only one unit last year, particularly to support data centers). The orders in W terms are expected to step up in 2H vs. 2Q results. In response, GEV is increasing its HDGT manufacturing capacity, from 55 in recent years to 70-80 units/year by 2026. As HDGT orders are booked, this also drives increasing service orders/ backlog. We see a path to high-teens adj. EBITDA margins for the Power segment by 2027 (vs. mid-teens in 2026) and an increasingly bullish case that

could culminate in (we think) $10bn of adj. EBITDA by 2028 (if Power margins can get to 25%) vs. current consensus of $9bn.

In GEV's relatively small (24% of company sales) but rapidly growing Electrification business, both the revenue and margin expansion dynamics are very favorable. We see the potential for revenue growth to remain in the double-digits over the next few years as the company executes on a growing backlog (which has more than doubled in the last 3Y, from $7bn to $28bn) and benefits from heightened investment in transmission equipment by Utility customers (along with government stimulus measures targeted at grid hardening). Utility and hyperscale customers (hyperscalers contributed ~$500m revenue to the

Electrification segment in 2024) are both investing heavily in the grid as part of the overall focus on increasing power generating capacity, and demand has been robust across a number of GEV's product lines (HVDC transformers, switchgears, synchronized condensing units) - there is no area where lead times are shrinking within this business. Further, pricing is still being gained but at a slower rate than 2024 but it varies a little bit by geography and by product type. However, over the last two years, GEV's Electrification has seen about nine points of margin and backlog expansion. So, looking ahead, there is already margin and backlog to be delivered moving into the 2026-2028. On top of this attractive revenue growth, we see the potential for the Electrification segment to deliver 30-40% incremental margins, consistent with performance seen over the last 2Y. As such, we forecast a 33% adj. EBITDA CAGR through 2028 within Electrification.

Perhaps the most attractive aspect of investing in GEV is the unique visibility investors have into revenue through 2028 (given the company's extended and growing backlog). But we are also gaining increased conviction in continued revenue growth in 2030 and beyond - if not through continued strength in gas turbine demand (conducting commercial discussions for gas backlog in 2030 and 2031), then through increased gas turbine service activity and realization of nuclear revenue. On the service point, gas turbines tend to see a major uptick in service revenue with their first outage, which occurs at ~3-4 years of age. This implies that service activity on turbines being shipped today/in the coming years should increase materially in the 2030s. And on nuclear, interest in GEV's small modular reactors (SMRs) remains high. The first SMR is in construction in Ontario for Ontario Power Generation (OPG) which is GEV's first customer. Further, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has now formally accepted Tennessee

Valley Authority's (TVA) application to construct a Clinch River site, which means the formal process has started and we expect more customer announcements with SMR technology in 2H25. We are also encouraged by the US government's mission to reduce the approval process for nuclear to ~18 months.

GEV looks expensive on both an absolute and relative basis, but this is justified by a superior EBITDA growth path and visibility into 2028 via its growing gas turbine backlog. We continue to favor it as it looks much more attractive using a PEG ratio, given that we forecast a ~38% adj. EBITDA CAGR through 2028. Our GEV price target of $694 is derived by applying 30x to our NTM adj. EV/EBITDA forecast, consistent with the trading multiples of best-in-class revenue/earnings growers within our coverage universe. Key risks include lower-than-expected global investment in power generating capacity, weak operational execution given importance of margin expansion to estimates, and incremental issues with wind turbine commissioning/project execution.

nVent Electric designs and manufactures electrical infrastructure solutions that protect, connect, and manage electricity. Key products include enclosures, racks, busways, and power distribution systems, as well as liquid-and air-based cooling solutions for data centers. End markets served include data centers, energy, industrial, and transportation. We have a positive view of the electrical products/ services industry as a whole, as we project top-tier medium-term organic growth driven largely by secular themes and government stimulus spending. Electrical equipment providers (peers such as ETN, VRT, HUBB) have been benefiting from data center buildouts following increased expenditures into AI and trade at a premium to the MI/EE group. NVT's multiple has also re-rated significantly as of late (currently at 26x NTM P/E; 13% premium to the the MI/EE median), catching up after lagging peers, and now looks reasonable to us (we had previously called for a re-rating).

Since its spin in 2018, nVent has been very acquisitive, completing eight acquisitions to date along with divestiture of Thermal Management. Pre-spin, 12% of company revenues were exposed to infrastructure (data center, power utilities, renewables), but this has increased to ~40%, transforming the portfolio into one that can deliver top-tier organic growth. Moreover, investor perception of the Thermal business was relatively negative, as it tended to be very lumpy (projectbased) and much of it was tied to the traditional O&G market, which is not viewed as a desirable vertical over the long term (most investors seeking out more clean energy exposure). We believe removing Thermal from the portfolio helped to underwrite the now-higher valuation multiple vs. NVT's history as it dampened cyclicality and simplified the portfolio offering. Regarding future M&A, NVT continues to see a very robust funnel/pipeline of opportunities and would like to do additional deals within the infrastructure vertical.

NVT's backlog has grown significantly in recent quarters, providing visibility into 2026 and beyond. In 2Q25, organic orders accelerated, up over 20%, led by strong double-digit growth in the Data Solutions business. In the rest of the business, organic orders grew high-single digits. These orders, coupled with contribution from acquisitions (EPG and Trachte), have resulted in NVT's backlog increasing more than fourfold Y/Y and partially underpinned the recent full-year guidance raise. In data centers, NVT is seeing strength across the portfolio and accelerating growth to support the AI buildout.

Although nVent's segment margins are at best-in-class levels, we see further margin expansion opportunities in both businesses. This will be driven by new product launches, which generally come with higher margins. Further, NVT sees opportunity to continue to drive productivity, especially within recent acquisitions. NVT has also been investing in new Data Solutions capacity in order to meet growing AI-driven demand. NVT targets 30%+ incrementals, which we view as achievable.

NVT trades currently trades at 25.5x NTM earnings, a 12% premium to the group median. Our NVT price target of $103 is derived by applying 25x to our NTM earnings forecast and so it assumes no additional multiple re-rating relative to where it is currently trading. However, organic growth and margin expansion should continue driving share price upside as the company benefits from integration/efficiencies of the updated portfolio exposed to higher growth/less cyclical end markets. Key risks include more negative pricing or price/cost trends vs. expectations, margin execution through tariff headwinds, lack of accretive capital allocation.

Eaton is a global power management company that provides electrical, energy, and industrial solutions to make power more reliable, efficient, and sustainable. Its portfolio spans electrical components, power distribution, enclosures, backup systems, aerospace systems, and vehicle technologies. ETN plays a key role in data centers, utilities, industrial facilities, transportation, and aerospace, helping customers manage energy and power infrastructure safely and efficiently. The portfolio is somewhat complex and it is not a pure play electrical equipment manufacturer, but nonetheless, ~70% of the business is tied to electrical markets with 12% of total sales directly exposed to data centers. ETN has an attractive mix of end markets, mostly tied to secular growth themes, namely Data centers/AI and Power & Utility, underpinning our belief that it can deliver best-in class top-line and earnings growth over the next several years. In our view, this justifies a premium valuation vs. peers.

As of 2Q25, the Electrical Sector and Electrical Americas data center orders were each up ~55%, and data center revenue was up ~50% Y/Y, demonstrating continued strong momentum. Eaton projects Data Centers & Distributed IT to post strong double-digit growth in 2025. Electrical Americas backlog grew 17% Y/Y, hitting a new all-time record. The major project negotiations pipeline was up 31% Y/Y, remaining at very a high level, up ~60% since 2Q23. This gives ETN strong visibility into 3Q orders, which could continue to accelerate in 3Q25.

At its recent investor day, Eaton raised its medium-term organic growth algorithm by 1ppt to +6-9% average annual growth through 2030 (to >$38bn total revenue). This is underpinned by 'strong DD' growth in data centers, 'solid growth' in Utilities, Aerospace, Commercial & Institutional, Resi, and Vehicles & eMobility verticals, and 'modest growth' in Industrial and Machinery verticals. The company also guided for robust segment margin expansion, reaching 28% by 2030. Based on the midpoint of the organic revenue CAGR, this implies ~35% incremental margins over the forecast period, consistent with 2025 guidance but above the company's prior ~30% long-term operating leverage target (more on this below). Note that this reflects a ~13%+ adj. EPS CAGR, slightly above ETN's guidance of >12% .

We think Eaton can re-accelerate earnings growth back into the mid-/high-teens range in 2026 (from ~LDD this year), as capacity expansion, tariff, and growth investment headwinds dissipate, and organic growth remains solidly in the very HSD/LDD range. Based on this view, we see scope for ETN to deliver >$14 of adj. EPS in 2026, slightly ahead of current consensus of $13.72. This level of earnings growth would still be near best-in-class levels within our coverage universe, justifying a premium valuation. In this sense, the medium-term thesis on the stock is still very much intact.

ETN stock trades ~27x NTM P/E, among the highest in our group (and a 17% premium to the group median), but this looks cheap relative to its more normal very high-20s multiple in recent years. Our price target of $410 (based on 27x our NTM EPS forecast) suggests attractive high-teens upside potential vs. the current share price. Risks include weakening data center capex, slowing power & utility investment, lack of accretive capital allocation given growing balance sheet capacity.
