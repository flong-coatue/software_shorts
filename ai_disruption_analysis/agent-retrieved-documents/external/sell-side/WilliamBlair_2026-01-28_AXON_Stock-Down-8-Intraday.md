Equity Research

January 28, 2026

Axon shares are down roughly 8% today, and while several factors could be contributing, we believe the move is likely tied to renewed attention on ICE's proposed body-camera funding reduction, concern surrounding another federal shutdown, and broader rotation in the AI trade. On the ICE piece specifically, the DHS fiscal 2026 budget proposal, released last June, is getting media attention as it gets closer to potential enactment. Important to note, the proposal is not ICE pulling back existing deployments, but rather pausing expansion, cutting about $15 million (73%) in incremental funding while keeping its current 4,200 devices fully in place.

From Axon's standpoint, the direct impact is insignificant. ICE represents a very small slice of Axon's customer base, which is dominated by state and local law enforcement agencies. In 2024 alone, Axon shipped over 300,000 body cameras, underscoring that any single federal agency's decision to pause program expansion is unlikely to have a material impact on overall demand. We view the market reaction as a narrative risk rather than an earnings risk, as Axon commands a premium because of the long-term body camera growth story tied to accountability and transparency trends.

We do not see the DHS budget reduction as a read-through to broader demand, though we acknowledge the federal context is more complicated than ICE simply pausing demand, with Trump rescinding the Biden-era federal body camera mandate in early 2025 and the DEA formally ending its body camera program in April 2025. Federal demand, however, remains a modest portion of overall deployments and revenue relative to its state and municipal base, where adoption trends remain robust. In addition, ongoing public scrutiny and highprofile incidents continue to support, not weaken, the demand for transparency tools for law enforcement. Taken together, we do not view the news surrounding the DHS budget as a change in Axon's trajectory and see the company's core growth drivers-state and local adoption, enterprise adoption, software attach, and ecosystem expansion-as firmly intact.

Axon provides technology solutions for the law enforcement market. Its products are used to provide less lethal alternative weapons, video cameras, evidence management, and records management. Axon's main products are the Taser electroshock weapon, Axon body and in-car cameras, Evidence.com video management system, and Axon Records RMS/CAD system. The value proposition of its products is to reduce the use of lethal force, increase transparency, simplify workflows, increase accessibility to video evidence, and increase law enforcement efficiency.

While we believe that investors were disappointed by the company's results last quarter, commentary on strong pipeline and unchanged backlog growth expectations suggests that the business has not fundamentally changed, creating a compelling entry point for investors. In our view, Axon's near-term expectations are really unchanged and management anticipates exiting the year with a strong fourth quarter. We believe the U.S. federal government shutdown is not expected to have an impact and the company could deliver another very strong fourth quarter based on its current pipeline. Furthermore, Axon's management expressed confidence in the ability to sustain growth for a longer period than investors may anticipate given its commentary that growth could sustain at levels similar to current growth rates for the next three to five years.

We believe Axon is likely to benefit from technology modernization trends in the public safety vertical that should persist for years. The company's relentless focus on innovation has allowed it to disrupt markets by improving and evolving its products. What we believe investors may not be fully appreciating is that Axon has shown that it can enter existing markets and outcompete entrenched incumbents by modernizing traditional workflows with cutting-edge technology. In our view, this is creating new market opportunities in emerging areas such as AI, next-generation CAD, fixed ALPR, drones/counter drones, VR, and cloud software, where customers can significantly improve their existing workflow efficiency. As these products improve in value proposition, we are seeing new markets expand in areas such as international and enterprise. We believe Axon's ability to capture data at the sensor level and to also leverage this data across applications and AI create strong network effects and platform benefits over the long term.

The stock is currently trading at about 13.4 times our revenue forecast for 2026 of $3.41 billion. We believe the company continues to innovate and execute well with strong demand across the board for its solutions, which should lead to continued positive earnings revisions. We maintain our Outperform rating.

Primary risks for Axon's stock include: 1) competition, 2) pricing pressure in the body and in-car camera markets, 3) difficulty entering the RMS/CAD market, 4) ability to sustain high level of innovation, and 5) costs associated with defending intellectual property rights.
