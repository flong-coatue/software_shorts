Transportation Services | Intermodal and Asset-Light Logistics David Hicks | (404) 442-5833 | david.hicks@raymondjames.com Patrick Tyler Brown, CFA | (404) 442-5803 | tyler.brown@raymondjames.com

We maintain our Outperform rating on C.H. Robinson (CHRW) given our view that meaningful operational transformation (lean and AI initiatives) is underway at the company post the hiring of CEO Bozeman (June 2023), ultimately bringing life to operating margins that have been on the decline for years. Industry tailwinds also favor CHRW through continued broker penetration and a consolidating freight brokerage industry, supporting its position as the largest domestic freight broker. While its Forwarding business (28% of gross profit in 2024) faces structural headwinds from an oversupplied ocean market, we believe this is well-understood by the market. All in, with shares trading at ~25x our 2027E EPS, we see a compelling risk/reward setup.

4Q Ahead on Lean-AI Gains; 2026 Guide Reaffirmed: CHRW reported 4Q25 adj. EPS of $1.23 (up +2% y/y), ahead of the Street/RJe at $1.12/$1.03. Gross revenue of $3.91B fell short of the Street at $3.99B (RJe at $3.95B), while adjusted gross profit of $657M was also weaker than expected (Street at $669M and RJe at $649M). That said, adjusted operating income of $197M (+7% y/y)

exceeded both the Street/RJe at $187M/$169M, reflecting continued Lean-AI productivity and cost optimization. Within CHRW's flagship NAST segment, adj. operating income was $150M (+12% y/y) vs. RJe at $143M, driven by above-market volumes (+3% y/y vs. -8% CASS shipments for 4Q), and by stronger than expected gross margin performance (260 bp y/y vs. RJe -30 bp). Global Forwarding (GF) generated $46M in adjusted operating income (-17% y/y), strongly above RJe at $32M, driven by stronger net revenues, mix (customs) and cost control. Management maintained their 2026 operating income target of $965M-$1.04B, while putting some additional framing around personnel expenses ($1.25-1.35B) and SG&A ($540-590M) for the year and are committed to double-digit productivity gains in 2026.

Not Your Father's Robinson; Lean-AI Flywheel Driving Share Gains and Structural Margin Uplift: After a string of impressive quarters in a muted demand environment (adjusted EPS up 58% from 2023 to 2025 vs. rest of our transport coverage down -20%), CHRW continues to prove to the market that it is not the C.H. Robinson of old. To this point, its Lean-AI operating model is scaling a fleet of agents across the quote-to-cash cycle to generate above-market volumes and pricing, all at a lower cost-to-serve, advantages that are difficult (if not impossible?) to replicate given CH's trove of data and in-house AI applications development. What has been so impressive to us, is the ability of Robinson to both grow volumes above market (by over 1,000 bp in 4Q) while also expanding margins meaningfully (NAST net operating margins +310 bp y/y). We think CHRW can continue on this path in 2026 (and beyond) and have confidence that management will be prudent in reinvesting margin (consternation point) as

opportunities arise for accelerated share capture as demand normalizes without rebuilding the cost base (30+ agents absorbing volume). Estimates: We are raising our 2026/2027E non-GAAP EPS to $6.20/$7.50 (from $6.10/$7.20).

Our $215 price target (from $185) is based on 29x our 2027E non-GAAP EPS, slightly above the high end of its 5-year historical range (14-28x) given what we see as an ongoing re-rating story as the company leverages AI to produce tangible financial returns.

We believe palpable change is underway in the operations at C.H. Robinson post the hiring of CEO Bozeman (June 2023), ultimately bringing life to operating margins that have been on the decline for years. Industry tailwinds also continue to favor C.H. Robinson with continued broker penetration in the vast for-hire freight market and a consolidating freight brokerage industry, aiding its position as the largest domestic freight broker.

C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW), based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, is a leading provider of third-party multimodal transportation services and logistics solutions. C.H. Robinson's unique business model has historically driven double-digit internal growth and strong financial returns (ROA of ~20% and ROE >30%) and offers customers speed and efficiency through technology along with a sales force that puts a premium on execution.

Our bull case scenario assumes a quicker and more intense recovery in TL spot rates, high-single digit volume growth, and more operating margin improvement than our base case. Our bull case share price is based on 30x our 2027 bull case EPS estimate of $8.25.

Analyst Compensation : Research analysts and associates at Raymond James are compensated on a salary and bonus system. Several factors enter into the compensation determination for an analyst, including: i) research quality, ii) team productivity, iii) client feedback, iv) rating accuracy, v) overall revenue and profitability levels of the department and firm (a portion of which is generated by investment banking activities) and vi) compensation levels for comparable research analysts at competing firms. Registration of Non-U.S. Analysts : The analysts listed on the front of this report who are not employees of, or associated with, RJA are not registered/qualified as research analysts under FINRA rules and are not subject to FINRA Rule 2241 restrictions on communications with covered companies, trading securities held by a research analyst account, and obligations related to identifying and managing conflicts of interest.

This global disclosure considers all entities of Raymond James and its affiliates. The jurisdiction where the analyst(s) is registered will determine what is permitted. For example, if the persons responsible for the content of this report are not licensed as research analysts in accordance with applicable rules promulgated by the regulatory organization(s) where this report is distributed, any client wishing to effect trades in any security should contact their Raymond James representative. The analysts David Hicks and Patrick Tyler Brown, primarily responsible for the preparation of this research report, attest to the following: (1) that the views and opinions rendered in this research report reflect his or her personal views about the subject companies or issuers and (2) that no part of the research analyst's compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views in this research report.

Our valuation is primarily based on forward enterprise value/EBITDA and P/E multiples in the context of the company's historical trading range and current peer group averages. We also take into account estimated free cash flows in yield-based analyses relative to peers and the broader market.

Following are some general risk factors that pertain to the businesses of the subject companies and the projected target prices and recommendations included on Raymond James research: (1) Industry fundamentals with respect to customer demand or product/service pricing could change and adversely impact expected revenues and earnings; (2) issues relating to major competitors or market shares or new product expectations could change investor attitude toward the sector or this stock; (3) Unforeseen developments with respect to the management, financial condition or accounting policies or practices could alter the prospective valuation.

Similar to virtually all freight transportation providers, C.H. Robinson remains exposed to cyclical trends in the economy, though its "asset-light" network does provide some measure of flexibility in slow times. C.H. Robinson operates in a specialized niche within the transportation market with relatively high barriers to entry compared to "asset-heavy" operators. However, it is likely that new competition will periodically attempt to compete with C.H. Robinson in this service arena. The company has successfully weathered these competitors in the past, but such new entries could possibly disrupt pricing trends from time to time. Further, internal technology development is key to maintaining/gaining share, requiring continued investment to stay ahead of the curve and provide a unique service offering.

Moderate Risk/Provide Income (M/INC) Larger capitalization, lower volatility (beta) equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings, and dividend yields meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. Many securities in this category are structured with a focus on providing a consistent dividend or return of capital. Moderate Risk/Wealth Accumulation (M/ACC) Larger capitalization equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings growth, the potential for long-term price appreciation, and often a dividend yield. Moderately Aggressive Risk/ Provide Income (MA/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a dividend meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. These companies typically feature sound financials, positive earnings, and the potential for long-term price appreciation. Moderately Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (MA/ACC) Generally equities of companies in fast growing and competitive industries with less predictable earnings (or losses), potentially more

leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, and potential risk of principal. Aggressive Risk/Provide Income (A/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a meaningful dividend but may face less predictable earnings (or losses), more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, financial and competitive issues, higher price volatility (beta), and meaningful risk of loss of principal. Securities of companies in this category may have a more volatile income stream from dividends or distributions of capital. Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) Generally equities of companies with a short or unprofitable operating history, limited or less predictable revenues, high risk associated with success, high volatility (beta), potential significant financial or legal issues, and the meaningful risk of loss of principal.

RJL has developed a proprietary algorithm for risk rating individual securities. The algorithm utilizes data from multiple vendors, and all data is refreshed at least monthly. Accordingly, suitability ratings are updated monthly. The suitability rating shown on this report is current as of the report's published date. In the event that a suitability rating changes after the published date, the new rating will not be reflected until the analyst publishes a subsequent report.
