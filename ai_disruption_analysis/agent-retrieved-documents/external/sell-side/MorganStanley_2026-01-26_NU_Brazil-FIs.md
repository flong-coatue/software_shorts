We conducted an online investor survey to understand buy-side consensus estimates on the Latam fintech names. The survey was conducted from January 12 to January 23, 2026. We got responses from 44 institutional investors globally. We want to thank everyone who participated; we appreciate your support and hope you find the findings value added. The geographic composition of the survey is: 36% Brazil, 30% USA, 23% UK/Europe, 9% Other, and 2% Asia. By type of investor: 36% EM/Latam long only, 18% EM/Latam hedge fund, 9% Non-EM/Latam long only, 27% Non-EM/Latam hedge fund, and 9% other.

· Investors are bullish Brazil equities -most see an up year with returns well north of 10%. The buy-side shows a strong skew toward positive returns. Indeed, 98% of respondents expect returns above 5% for the iBovespa index, with the largest observations in the up 10 to 20% range (55% of respondents) and in the over 20% range (30% of respondents). We found only a small minority of investors (2%) that expect flattish returns, and not one single investor that expect negative returns. International investors are marginally less optimistic on equity returns this year relative to their Brazil peers.

· On a relative basis, buy-siders seem bullish on fintech -a noticeably more upbeat view versus last year's survey. Buy-siders seem bullish on fintech names relative to the market. On aggregate, for all stocks we tested, 50% of respondents expect outperformance, a much larger share versus the 26% that expect in-line performance and 23% that expect underperformance. This represents a more upbeat view versus last year's survey when 47% expected outperformance, 23% in -line performance, and 30% underperformance. · Most and least favored stocks: NU, INTR, and XP show the largest observations of likely outperformance among survey participants. On the flip side, STNE and PAGS are the least likely to outperform, as per our buy-side survey.

· NU is the overwhelming top stock for 2026. The majority (88%) of investors expect outperformance versus a tiny portion (2%) that expect underperformance. No other stock comes close to this positive skew. NU also shows the largest year-on-year swing: last year 33% expected NU to outperform versus 49% to underperform. FYI, the bulls proved correct last year as NU far outpaced the market: NU up 62% versus MSCI Brazil index up 40%.

· Buy-side net income views align with sell-side consensus for 2026, but diverge in 2027. For 2026, the buy-side seems broadly aligned with the sellside: 'In -Line' was the most common response across the stocks we tested. For 2027, buy-side views are more dispersed, with roughly onethird of respondents expecting net income to be 'In Line,' 'Above,' and 'Below' consensus . NU stands out with the most positive buy-side skew (details below). On the negative skew side, XP, STNE, and PAGS show the largest negative skew among peers.

· NU shows the strongest positive skew on buyside net income expectations, reversing last year's pattern. NU's 'Above' bucket captures the largest share of responses: 56% for both 2026 and 2027. Notably, in last year's survey NU had the most negative skew, with the 'Below' bucket accounting for 55% of responses for 2025 and 60% for 2026 . FYI, NU far outpaced both buy- and sell-side consensus in 2025, and the current 2026 sell-side forecast of US$4,171 million is well above the year-ago estimate of US$3,660 million. Of note, our 2026 estimate of US$4,278 million remains mostly unchanged since last year.

· Valuation rankings show lower investor conviction. Unlike prior surveys, this year's valuation rankings show lower conviction, with no stock capturing more than 20% of #1 ranking (i.e, most attractively valued). PAGS marginally leads at the top end but also ranks highly at the bottom, resulting in a bimodal distribution. Conviction is stronger on the least-attractive side, where DLO and INTR cluster toward #5 and #6 rankings. NU and STNE show flat distributions, suggesting limited differentiation in valuation views, while XP exhibits a multimodal pattern, reflecting dispersed views.

· Relative to sell-side consensus price targets, the buy-side is more bullish on NU and XP, and more bearish on PAGS and STNE. In aggregate, the buy-side skews modestly positive across the stocks tested: 40% of respondents are above consensus, 36% in line, and 24% below, with no meaningful divergence between Brazil-based and international investors. On a stock-by-stock basis: ➢ NU shows the strongest upside skew, with 78% of respondents having PT above sellside consensus, including 23% 'significantly' a nd 55% 'modestly' above. NU also has the lowest share of 'in -line' and 'below' observations in the group. ➢ XP also skews positive, with 50% of respondents above consensus, evenly split between 'significantly' and 'modestly' above. ➢ INTR and DLO display near-normal distributions, with about half of responses in line and the remainder evenly split between above and below.

➢ STNE and PAGS have the highest share of below-consensus price targets, with Brazil-based investors notably more negative than international peers for both names. · As a bonus question, we asked investors whether they expect President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to be re-elected. Responses were closely split, with the 'No' camp narrowly edging the 'Yes' camp (55% vs. 45%), and no significant differences between Brazil -based and international investors. However, linking election expectations to market views reveals a clear divergence in sentiment: investors who do not expect Lula's re -election are meaningfully more bullish on the iBovespa, with 42% anticipating returns above 20%, compared with just 15% among those expecting a re-election. Notably, regardless of election expectations, no respondents foresee negative market returns in 2026.

Nubank is well on its way to building the largest and most profitable banking franchise in Latam, with superior technology, best-in-class customer satisfaction, and strong cohort performance and unit economics. Yet, we think the market is still significantly underestimating Nubank's ability to deliver further growth and profitability -especially through cross-selling personal and payroll loans in Brazil and building a successful franchise in Mexico and Colombia. We continue to think that Nubank could reach US$100 billion valuation this year, up from US$90 billion today. This translates to a fair value P/E multiple of 22.3x for 2026, an attractive level in our view given the strong growth and profitability profile of the business (e.g., >30% ROE from 2025 to 2028). For more details on our call please see: The Path to $100 Billion , The Rise (and Rise) of Nubank, NU Catch-Up: Set to Accelerate, In Leaps and Bounds (or Why Consensus is Wrong on Payroll Loans), and The

End of Cheap Funding: Is Fintech Rewriting Mexican Banking?.

We are constructive on the earnings outlook for XP, particularly within the context of falling interest rates in 2026. The company stands to benefit from two key effects of falling rates: portfolio rotation and renewed investor confidence. As fixed-income yields decline, investors are more likely to shift into stocks, funds, and alternative products -all core to XP's platform. This rotation boosts trading activity, AUM, and revenue tak e rate, while a rebound in capital markets should revive XP's currently subdued investment banking business. Longer term, XP remains a structural share gainer thanks to its lower fees, broader product suite, and differentiated advisory model, advantages that shine brightest in a low-rate environment. We think valuation looks reasonable relative to LT growth and ROE expansion, with XP currently trading at 10.4x 2026e P/E and 8.9x 2027e P/E.

Brazil payments has now reached 'The End of Growth' which was a counter-consensus prediction that we first articulated in late 2024. Despite this reality, it appears as though consensus continues to underestimate the negatives from market saturation. Payments is a commoditized industry, and saturation will likely lead to slower growth, price compression, and falling profitability. We expect net income for PagSeguro and Stone will barely grow over the next five years -in sharp contrast to the current sell-side consensus, which anticipates high single-digit growth. For PagSeguro, our 2026 and 2027 net income estimates are 2-12% below consensus, and our long-term forecasts are 32% lower. For Stone, our 2026 and 2027 net income estimates are 14-30% below consensus, and our long-term forecasts are 34% lower. Our price targets imply 30-44% stock downside, while sell-side targets suggest 7-29% potential

upside.

dLocal is an attractive play on rising electronic payments & e-commerce penetration in Emerging Markets. The company looks poised to capture future industry growth given its unique one-stop-shop model & best-in-class success rates. In addition, we see attractive avenues for topline growth at the company level, including rising share of wallet, new clients, and roll out of new solutions, among others. That said, forecasting visibility is limited given how concentrated the company's business is to a few clients and geographies. Hence, competition, tariff renegotiations, FX devaluation, and regulatory changes can move the needle significantly in the P&L. Meanwhile, over the short-term, management continues to make additional investments in tech, people, and processes, that may limit near-term margin expansion. Given this balanced risk-reward skew over the short-term, we prefer to remain EW. Our price target of US$15 implies the shares would be trading at 17.7x 2026 P/E.

Inter & Co has undergone a transformation that has resulted in rising profitability. Although, while the company has successfully expanded its client base and improved cost efficiency, it has failed to deliver on stronger customer monetization. Its business remains heavily reliant on secured lending and lowyield transactional products and services. And, in our view, a lack of risk appetite, underwriting capabilities, and technological prowess -or a combination of these -will continue to hinder its ability to monetize its customer base effectively. Given this, along with only marginal cost efficiency gains going forward, we expect ROE to remain below the cost of equity for the foreseeable future -falling short of management's 30% target for 2027. All told, valuation seems high for a bank with long-term ROE below cost of equity. For the latest on Inter, please see: 3Q25 Conference Call Highlights and Why We Are Underweight.

· We asked survey participants to tell us their expectation for the Brazil equity market performance in 2026. · The buy-side shows a strong skew toward positive returns. Indeed, 98% of respondents expect returns above 5% for the iBovespa index, with the largest observations in the up 10 to 20% range (55% of respondents) and in the over 20% range (30% of respondents). · Of note, we found only a small minority of investors (2%) that expect flattish returns, i.e., up or down less than 5%, and not one single investor that expect negative returns. · We noticed that international investors are marginally less optimistic on equity returns this year relative to their Brazil peers. · As of the closing of our survey (January 23, 2026), the iBovespa index was up 11% for the year. Even versus this YTD performance, our survey suggests investors continue to expect attractive positive returns for the rest of the year.

· We asked survey participants how their 2026 and 2027 GAAP net income estimates compare with current sell-side consensus. For 2026, the buyside seems broadly aligned with the sellside: 'In -Line' was the most common response across the stocks we tested. For 2027, buy-side views are more dispersed, with roughly onethird of respondents expecting net income to be 'In Line,' 'Above,' and 'Below' consensus .

· NU stands out with the most positive buyside skew, as the 'Above' bucket captures the largest share of responses: 56% for both 2026 and 2027. Notably, in last year's survey NU had the most negative skew, with the 'Below' bucket accounting for 55% of responses for 202 5 and 60% for 2026. FYI, NU far outpaced both buy- and sell-side consensus in 2025, and the current 2026 sell-side forecast of US$4,171 million is well above the year-ago estimate of US$3,660 million. Of note, our 2026 estimate of US$4,278 million remains mostly unchanged since last year.

· On the negative skew side, XP, STNE, and PAGS show the largest negative skew among peers. This aligns with buy-side stock preferences (see slide 8) for PAGS and STNE, but appears counterintuitive for XP. Despite ranking XP as a top-three stock for the year, the buy-side also sees the greatest downside risk to consensus estimates. This suggests XP's appeal is driven primarily by valuation multiple . · The full details of buy- vs sell-side consensus by stock can be found in the Appendix (Slides 17 thru 22).

FOUNDATION · We asked survey participants how their fair value estimates compare with current sell-side consensus price targets. In aggregate, across all stocks tested, the buy-side skews modestly positive: 40% of respondents have price targets above consensus, 36% are in line, and 24% are below. We found no meaningful divergence between Brazil and international investors at the aggregate level. On a stock-by-stock basis, we note the following: · NU (sell-side PT of $19.5) . Investor views are strongly skewed to the upside, with 78% of respondents reporting price targets above sell-side consensus. Within this group, 23% are 'significantly' above and 55% are 'modestly' above. Across all stocks surveyed, NU ha s the lowest share of 'in -line' and 'below' price target observations .

· XP (sell-side PT of $24.0). Buyside views also skew positive, with 50% of respondents in the 'above' bucket, evenly split between 'significantly' and 'modestly' above consensus . · INTR (sell-side PT of $9.8) and DLO (sell-side PT of $17.1) . Both stocks display near-normal distributions, with roughly half of responses in the 'in -line' bucket and the remainder evenly split between 'above' and 'below'.

· STNE (sell-side PT of $20.6) & PAGS (sell-side PT of $11.8) . These names show the highest share of buy-side respondents with price targets below consensus. To our surprise, Brazil-based investors are more negative than their International peers, with an even higher concentration of 'below' price target observations for both STNE and PAGS. Details by geography included in the Appendix (slide 23).

Distribution of buy-side expectations for PT versus sell-side consensus Morgan Stanley Research Source:

· Given the importance of the presidential election for market outcomes this year, we asked investors whether they expect President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to be re-elected. Responses were closely split, though the 'No' camp narrowly edges the 'Yes' camp, accounting for 55% of respondents versus 45%. We found no statistically significant differences between the views of Brazil-based and international investors. · Cross-checking these responses with expectations for market performance reveals a clear divergence in sentiment. Investors in t he 'No' camp hold a notably more bullish view on the iBovespa index, with 42% expecting returns above 20%, compared with only 15% among those who expect Lula to be re-elected. · Notably, regardless of expectations around the election outcome, no respondents anticipate negative market returns for the year.

Our valuation work and price targets are based on residual income analysis. In our residual income model, the value of the firm is mainly a function of the magnitude of the spread between return on equity and cost of equity (performance spread) and the time period in which management can generate returns in excess of the cost of equity (economic growth horizon). Our valuation uses a discount rate of 13.2%, and long-term ROE of 11%. Risks include: economic slowdown could impact delinquency and loan growth, cost overruns and rising delinquency due to rapid balance sheet growth, regulatory headwinds, and tougher competition. In addition, we see execution risks around cross selling and client monetization, rollout of new products and geographic expansion where management has limited expertise.
