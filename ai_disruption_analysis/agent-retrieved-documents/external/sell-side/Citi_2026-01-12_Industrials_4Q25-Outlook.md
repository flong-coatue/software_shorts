AI/electrification-led demand we think remains poised to lead growth themes in 4Q25 with more mixed trends elsewhere that should nonetheless remain supportive of largely inline results across most of our coverage. ’26 guidance/outlooks will be a primary focus and likely reflective of still largely positive growth momentum across Multis, albeit with a wide dispersion of expected outcomes (across Multis, we see ’26 organic growth ranging from ~flat to 20%+). Lingering frictions including tariff-related uncertainties and potential input cost pressures could temper outlooks in certain instances, but we are also optimistic that a more moderate interest rate environment and growing OBBBA-related tailwinds could be increasingly constructive factors over the course of ’26 and we continue to recommend “broadened” portfolios that include tactical short-cycle exposure. Top Picks ahead of the quarter include ETN, ROK, VRT, EMR, and DOV (opening +ive Catalyst Watch). Organic Growth & Op Margins —

Overall, we model sector organic growth of 4.3% in 4Q25 (vs. 3.7% in 3Q25 and 3.6% in 4Q24) with continued positive momentum in data center-related demand contributing to outsized growth for exposed Multis and consumer-oriented markets such as resi HVAC likely still pressured. Sector profitability we think could remain relatively solid; we model sector average op margin of 20.5% (vs. 19.7% in 4Q24) with focused execution and still mainly favorable price/cost dynamics supportive of healthy profitability. Top Picks Into 4Q —

Top Picks ahead of 4Q25 results include ETN, who, despite some likely lingering near-term frictions in portions of the business that are causing a minor “earnings reset”, we see as well positioned for continued elevated data center led organic growth with likely improving profitability over the course of ’26 as prior capacity investments ramp production; tactical short-cycle pick ROK with likely accelerating topline, strong op leverage and growing “physical AI” tailwinds; data center-leveraged VRT; EMR with what we view as good visibility to accelerating organic growth over the course of FY26; and DOV with idiosyncratic end market exposures that we think should deliver accelerating topline with solid operating leverage. Valuation & Crowding —

Sector average relative NTM P/E of 1.05x vs. the S&P500 is below the 10-year average of 1.09x and we think reflects still mixed demand trends/growth rates across industrial end markets that we think could nonetheless represent good risk/reward for selective investors. With respect to Crowding, EMR screens as our least crowded Buy-rated Multi, followed by VNT and HON. We find HON having a low crowding score particularly intriguing given what we believe could be a significant potential catalyst for valuation upside in terms of its industrial/aero separation expected in 2H26.

Overall, we model sector organic growth of 4.3% in 4Q25 (vs. 3.7% in 3Q25 and 3.6% in 4Q24) with continued positive momentum in data center-related demand contributing to outsized growth for exposed Multis and consumer-oriented markets such as resi HVAC likely still pressured. Sector profitability we think could remain relatively solid; we model sector average op margin of 20.5% (vs. 19.7% in 4Q24) with focused execution and still mainly favorable price/cost dynamics supportive of healthy profitability. In the near-term, we don’t see significant signs of a material change in underlying demand trends across Multis end market that would cause a meaningful deviation (positive or negative) from expected 4Q25 results. December Manufacturing PMI at 47.9 remained sub-50 (vs. 48.2 in November), marking a 10 th

consecutive month (and 36 out of 38months) of sub-50 PMI readings. That said, PMI in a relatively narrow band in recent months (July ’25 -Dec ‘25 PMI readings ranged from a low of 47.9 to a high of 49.1) we think likely reflects lingering uncertainty/frictions continuing to weigh on broader industrial activity vs. a signal of significant incremental end market deterioration. More broadly, we see secular growth tailwinds including growing power demand and AI-related data center capex as intact (including growing demand for thermal management in data centers, despite some recent concerns - Event-Driven (Post #202): Rubin May Require Less Water Chillers, but Remain Constructive on Thermal Mgmt.

We’re also encouraged by recent Dodge Momentum Index levels and commentary; despite monthly DMI volatility in recent months, the DMI was +37% calendar 2025, which we view as a positive sign for non-residential construction going forward. Commentary from Dodge indicates an expectation for accelerating non-resi starts in ’27 given recent planning activity, which we think highlights potentially durable tailwinds for a broad range of Multis exposed directly and indirectly to commercial construction activity. Additionally, commentary indicating that “projects moved through the planning process marginally quicker in 25-Q4 (16 months vs. 18 months in 25-Q3)” is also, we think, an encouraging sign. We think industrial customers are beginning to “adapt” to continued volatility in the geopolitical environment (including tariff-related uncertainty), and with a number of subtle but potential catalysts such as lower US interest rates and increasing benefits from OBBBA (such as 100% bonus depreciation/immediate R&D expensing) and after such a prolonged period of industrial “malaise” (as reflected in the US ISM), we do see the potential for a more broad-based industrial production rebound as 2026 evolves.

It remains early to quantify the immediate impacts of the Court’s decision and we would anticipate incremental actions by the Trump administration to “recoup” much of the revenue impacted by the disallowed tariffs through alternative tariff measure. That said, we think Multis have, to date, proven adept at adjusting to a dynamic tariff environment through a combination of measures such as pricing actions, supply chain modifications, and design changes. As such, we view potential incremental changes in the tariff environment as a source of uncertainty and potential modest friction to business activity, but likely largely immaterial or even slightly positive to overall profitability for most of our Multis under coverage over time given we think pricing could remain modestly “stickier” than declining costs if in fact IEEPA-based tariffs are deemed illegal. Top Picks Into 4Q —

Top Picks ahead of 4Q25 results include ETN, who, despite some likely lingering near-term frictions in portions of the business that are causing a minor “earnings reset”, we see as well positioned for continued elevated data center led organic growth with likely improving profitability over the course of ’26 as prior capacity investments ramp production; tactical short-cycle pick ROK with likely accelerating topline, strong op leverage and growing “physical AI” tailwinds; data center-leveraged VRT; EMR with what we view as good visibility to accelerating organic growth over the course of FY26; and DOV with idiosyncratic end market exposures that we think should deliver accelerating topline with solid operating leverage. Below, we highlight additional thoughts on our Top Picks into 4Q : ETN –

We continue to pitch ETN favorably heading into 4Q25 results supported by what we view as a robust DD multi-year earnings growth outlook. While we acknowledge certain N-T headwinds - including ongoing EA margin headwinds from ongoing capacity additions, continued resi-weakness impacting top-line growth, and higher corporate expense line-items vs. previous expectations (see our model update further below for details where we do modestly lower our EPS estimates) - we think these factors are well understood by investors and largely reflected in ETN's current valuation. Importantly, we think margin headwinds tied to capacity additions should begin subsiding in 2H26 (contributing roughly a ~100bps drag in 2025), and we expect accelerating EA order growth to remain sustainable given ETN's strong positioning in the data center market (orders +70% y/y in 3Q25, supported by its strong power management capabilities, expanding white space exposure, and service footprint). In addition, we think margin expansion opportunities outside of Electrical Americas (driven by restructuring efforts in Electrical Global and easing supply chain challenges in Aerospace) combined with ETN's acceleration of capital deployment should provide further upside (particularly, we think the pending Boyd Thermal acquisition could provide ETN a strategic beachhead into the liquid cooling market, which we continue to

view favorably as next-generation GPU architectures increasingly adopt this technology). From a relative perspective, we see ETN’s recent valuation de-rating vs. peers as creating a favorable risk/reward profile. Despite trading at a discount vs. peers, ETN continues to deliver above-average financial performance across key metrics—organic growth, FCF as a % of sales, and operating profit margin—all exceeding peer average. For instance, when comparing ETN to PH (in our view, historically one of ETN's closest Multi-industry peers), we think part of the recently widening valuation gap (PH is trading at a relative NTM P/E premium to ETN of ~0.22x vs. its 15-yr average relative discount of ~0.03x) is PH's meaningful portfolio transformation and significant improvements in profitability (driven, in our view, by PH's Win Strategy, which we've continued to view as a key competitive differentiator since our initiation ).

– Despite ROK’s stock outperformance (+47% in 1-year vs. S&P500 +18%), we continue to see good upside potential for the stock given a combination of encouraging long-term demand trends across ROK’s end markets, continued margin expansion potential, and capital deployment flexibility that could support higher than expected earnings growth potential. We think ROK will emerge as a key beneficiary from what we expect should be durable and elongated automation up-cycle – supported by OBBBA provisions in the US and a shift in manufacturing supply chain globally. ROK’s enhanced products/solutions offerings (including capabilities across AI, software defined automation and robotics), we think incrementally support competitiveness and that combined with ROK’s already strong installed base should support the company's growth in our view. We do acknowledge continued relatively weak PMI readings (as discussed) and some lingering uncertainty related to some customers’ capex spending outlook, but a mixed demand environment in the near-term, we think is baked into what we view as ROK’s balanced FY26 guidance, and we think ROK is well positioned to benefit as business sentiments/outlook improves over time. Lastly, ROK’s ongoing actions toward further improving its operational productivity, optimize costs, and drive manufacturing efficiency should enable ROK to deliver strong operating leverage on top-line growth that could contribute to solid multi-year EPS growth.

We continue to view Vertiv as the best positioned among our Multis coverage to capitalize on a robust data center capex cycle given its broad portfolio of power & thermal management products, global service capabilities (further augmented by its recent PurgeRite acquisition), and innovation focus, which we think should allow VRT to deliver 18%+ organic growth in ‘26/’27 (well above VRT’s L-T% 12%-14% CAGR). While we acknowledge that “growing pains” (strained supply chain/capacity given unusually high growth) and lingering tariff headwinds could impact profitability, we think that VRT (under CEO Gio’s focus on execution) remains well positioned to drive margin expansion in FY26/beyond toward VRT’s L-T ~25% adj. op margin target by 2029 (VRT expects to offset tariff impacts exiting 1Q26). Additionally, meaningful capital deployment optionality (in the form of technology focused M&A and/or share repurchases) should further augment earnings growth, which coupled with modest recent de-rating, we think presents a favorable risk/reward set-up for VRT.

Despite a recent bounce in EMR’s share price, we continue to view the stock as representing good risk/reward and still somewhat under-appreciated through the cycle growth potential. Notably, with EMR already having guided to FY26, we view guidance as largely “de-risked” ahead of upcoming earnings. As such, relatively “sluggish” organic growth early in EMR’s FY26 should be well anticipated with relatively good visibility to accelerating growth over the course of the year as software renewal dynamics (an expected ~2-point drag on F1H growth) ease over the course of the year. Sequential improvement in underlying orders trends over the past couple of quarters (+6% in FY4Q25 vs. +4% in F3Q25) are an encouraging sign and with F4Q Test & Measurement orders in particular reflecting outsized strength (F4Q orders +27%), we see the potential for short-cycle related upside over the course of the year if recent T&M orders momentum continues. DOV –

We continue to see an attractive L-T/risk-reward for DOV shares at current levels given what we view as a strengthening outlook for organic growth in 2026 as well as solid margin expansion and capital deployment opportunities. While 2025 organic growth has been relatively muted (we model ~1.5%), we think DOV is well positioned to deliver MSD organic growth in 2026 (we model 4.6%) supported by improving tailwinds across its portfolio. We think easier comps and increasing tariff-related visibility should provide a tailwind to DOV’s refrigeration door case business (industry-wide shipments in 3Q25 were at a 20-yr low, partly driven by tariff-related uncertainty delaying maintenance and replacement capex), while improving auto-related signals from our Credit Card insights report

would suggest some stabilization to DOV’s vehicle lift business. Within DPPS, we think that the company’s single-use biopharma business (~50% YTD growth), recently acquired Sikora business (+30% YTD pro-forma), CPC business (provides quick disconnect couplings used in liquid cooling loops), and gas infrastructure exposure should more than offset cyclicality within DOV’s industrial pumps business. Additionally, we view DOV’s retail fueling business (~15% of sales) benefiting from regulatory-driven replacement cycles and healthy customer capex trends .

As for self-help opportunities, we think operational execution improvements ($70mn restructuring cost in ‘25/’26 resulting in ~$60mn incremental benefit) and continued portfolio transformation under CEO Tobin should position DOV to deliver (at least) at the high-end of its L-T 25-35% incremental margin target (we model 35%+ in ‘26/’27), in-line with recent company commentary (DOV Management has recently said publicly that it is “locked in at the top end of that range”). Finally, we think DOV’s moderate leverage and strong FCF generation profile should support incremental capital deployment opportunities, with our sense being that DOV could continue to favor share repurchases in the N-T (in-line with DOV’s recent ASR ) given relatively elevated transaction multiples. Valuation & Crowding —

– We screen our coverage universe from a crowding standpoint (score is run by Citi’s Equity Research Quant team) and layering-on the current macro environment dynamics, secular demand drivers, and self-help optionality, we highlight Buy-rated EMR, VNT, and HON as relatively less crowded stocks where we expect good upside potential for patient investors. EMR remains one of our top picks as we see a combination of healthy underlying fundamentals (mix of positively developing end market trends + still significant “self-help” tailwinds) and what we consider a discounted valuation (vs. close peers) providing a good buying opportunity for long-term investors. VNT stock has been a relative underperformer (+8% in 1 yr vs. S&P500 +18%), but we’re encouraged by recent Citi’s Credit Card

data reflecting positively inflecting spending trends across car washes (4Q25 finish of +5.2% y/y) and stabilizing trends across auto-related categories that we think should be indicative of bottoming/inflecting trends across VNT’s DRB (car wash) and Matco (auto repair) businesses, supporting improving growth potential as ’26 progresses. (Please see “Card Insights General Description & Disclaimer and Methodology” above Valuation and Risks or Appendix A1). For HON

The five metrics below are percentile ranked individually across a broad universe of stocks within each region. These rankings are then equally weighted to create the final Crowding Composite score for each stock. We require at least four of these five metrics to have data in order to calculate the crowding composite score. A higher (lower) composite rank indicates a higher (lower) amount of crowding compared to the rest of the universe. 1) Most Crowded Quant Factor – ranking of the most crowded factor based on Citi Quant research. 2) Historical Relative Valuation – an equal-weighted composite of historical relative Price to Book and Price to FY1 Earnings. We require 24 months of historical data. A higher valuation score indicates more crowding. 3) Short Interest Ratio – historical relative short interest ratio (the amount of short interest as % of available inventory). We require 24 months of historical data. Lower short interest ratio indicates a higher consensus trade.

We are introducing our 2028 estimates (please refer to our financial model for additional details). Our price target remains unchanged at $181 based on ~20x our ’27 EPS estimate. A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS.N) Neutral | TP US$72.00 | Price US$70.52 (09 Jan 26 16:00) Andrew Kaplowitz | andrew.kaplowitz@citi.com | +1-212-816-0642 We incorporate in our estimates AOS’ recent Leonard Valve acquisition, which we estimate to be slightly accretive to earnings. As such, we raise our ’27 estimate from $4.30 to $4.35. Our target price remains unchanged at $72, now based on our updated ’27 Adj. EPS estimates and a slightly lower valuation multiple of 16.5x (from 17x). The lower multiple reflects a softer residential/housing backdrop and continued China-related headwinds, which we believe warrant a cautious stance

on valuation despite the incremental earnings benefit from the acquisition. Additionally, we extend our model to account for our ’28 estimates. APi Group Corporation (APG.N) Buy | TP US$49.00 from US$45.00 | Price US$41.87 (09 Jan 26 16:00) Andrew Kaplowitz | andrew.kaplowitz@citi.com | +1-212-816-0642

We are maintaining our Adj. EBITDA estimates for APG, while increasing our EV/EBITDA multiple to 18.5x from 17x, resulting in a new target price of $49 from $45. The raised multiple reflects our increased confidence in APG’s growth and margin trajectory, supported by several quarters of consistently solid organic growth across both segments. We believe this performance provides greater conviction that current momentum is becoming more durable. With improved visibility and ongoing margin expansion, we view APG as better positioned for healthier long-term earnings growth. That said, our Adj. EPS estimates are modestly lower to reflect the dilutive impact of the Series A Preferred Dividend. CSW Industrials Inc (CSW.N) Neutral | TP US$333.00 from US$311.00 | Price US$319.54 (09 Jan 26 16:00) Andrew Kaplowitz | andrew.kaplowitz@citi.com | +1-212-816-0642

We maintain our Adj. EBITDA and Adj. EPS estimates for CSW, while increasing our target price to $333 from $311 based on a one-turn increase in our EV/EBITDA valuation multiple (from 14x to 15x) on our unchanged ’27 Adj. EBITDA of $376mn. While we continue to acknowledge a pressured residential/housing backdrop, we think the company should continue to be able to integrate recently closed acquisitions (MARS and ASPEN) well. In addition, increased exposure to HVAC repair end markets through the acquisitions should provide a degree of resilience, supporting the one-turn multiple expansion despite ongoing housing/residential-related headwinds. Carrier Global Corporation (CARR.N) Buy | TP US$70.00 from US$71.00 | Price US$56.25 (09 Jan 26 16:00) Andrew Kaplowitz | andrew.kaplowitz@citi.com | +1-212-816-0642

We’re updating our estimates to reflect some increased N-T pressures in NAM resi HVAC markets vs. our prior expectations and introducing our ’28 EPS estimate. With that, our ‘25/’26/’27 EPS go to $2.60/$2.85/$3.20 (from $2.65/$2.95/$3.30); our ’28 EPS estimate is $3.70. We tweak our price target to $70 based on 22x our updated ’27 EPS estimate (from $71 based on ~22x our prior ’27 EPS).

| TP US$231.00 | Price US$201.89 (09 Jan 26 16:00) Andrew Kaplowitz | andrew.kaplowitz@citi.com | +1-212-816-0642 We maintain our target price of $231 on our unchanged ~20x P/E multiple applied on our unchanged ’27 EPS estimate. We continue to think DOV’s short-cycle optionality and meaningful op margin expansion potential (supported by DOV’s focused execution and improving mix composition) should support durable earnings growth in ‘26/beyond. Additionally, we extend our model to account for our ’28 estimates. Eaton Corp (ETN.N) Buy | TP US$435.00 from US$442.00 | Price US$324.51 (09 Jan 26 16:00) Andrew Kaplowitz | andrew.kaplowitz@citi.com | +1-212-816-0642

We lower our ‘26/’27 EPS estimates to $13.45/$15.25 (from $13.80/15.50) and maintain our ~29x P/E multiple; subsequently, we lower our price target to $435 (from $442). Primarily explaining our lowered estimates include higher than expected corporate expense drag in 2026 rolling to our ’27 estimates (we model ~$1,030mn corporate expense in ’26 vs. our modeled ~$940mn in ’25) as well as pressured markets continuing to lag (i.e., residential and vehicle end markets). That said, we think that overall growth potential at ETN remains compelling (we model ~8% organic growth in ’26, which would represent market outperformance vs. ETN’s initial expectation of ~7% market growth) driven by ETN’s power management portfolio (which we think should continue to benefit from what we view as a robust data center capex cycle, particularly in EA) as well as an acceleration of capital deployment (ETN’s announced Boyd Thermal acquisition would significantly expand its liquid cooling exposure, an end market that we view favorably as next-generation GPU architectures increasingly adopt this technology).

Flowserve (FLS.N) Buy | TP US$85.00 from US$82.00 | Price US$73.47 (09 Jan 26 16:00) Andrew Kaplowitz | andrew.kaplowitz@citi.com | +1-212-816-0642 We modestly raise our target price to $85 (from $82) based on a tweaked ~19x P/E multiple (given higher market multiples) applied to our unchanged ’27 EPS estimate. We incorporate in our estimates FLS’s recent Greenray Turbine Solutions acquisition, which while we estimate is slightly accretive to earnings, is offset by slightly lower organic growth in ’26 (driven by project-based lumpiness). Additionally, we extend our model to account for our ’28 estimates.

GE Vernova Inc (GEV.N) Neutral | TP US$708.00 from US$658.00 | Price US$622.50 (09 Jan 26 16:00) Andrew Kaplowitz | andrew.kaplowitz@citi.com | +1-212-816-0642 We update our model to better reflect GEV’s updated long-term guidance and to introduce our ’28 estimates. With that, our ’25 EBITDA estimate is unchanged and we raise our ‘26/’27 EBITDA estimates to ~$5.3bn/~$7.5bn (from ~$4.9bn/~$6.9bn); our ’28 EBITDA estimate is ~$9.5bn. We raise our target price to $708, now based on 25x our updated ’27 EBITDA (from $658 based on 25x our prior ’27 EBITDA). Gates Corporation (GTES.N) Buy | TP

We modestly lower our target price to $27 (from $28) based on our unchanged ~10x EV/EBITDA multiple applied on our modestly lowered ’27 adj. EBITDA estimate of $897mn (from $911mn) primarily driven by what we think could be a slow start for organic growth in 2026 given tough y/y comps from new customer ramp-up in 1Q25 as well as potential modest sales disruptions associated with GTES’ ERP conversion for most of its European footprint (we now model FY26 ~2.5% organic growth vs. prior ~3.0%). That said, we continue to think that GTES’ new product introductions/innovations could help the company expand its market share over time (both in different end markets over time, such as the company’s target of growing its data center revenues to $150mn-$200mn by 2028, as well as through new customer additions). Additionally, we extend our model to account for our ’28 estimates. Honeywell International Inc (HON.O) Buy | TP US$262.00 from US$267.00 |

We update our model to reflect HON’s spin-off of Advanced Materials (given HON’s disclosed historical data and updated ’25 guidance) and subsequently our ’25 EPS goes to $9.75 (from $10.65). We are also modestly lowering our ‘26/’27 EPS estimates to $10.50/$11.50 (from $10.70/$11.70) to reflect what we think could be a modestly softer inflection in HON’s select short-cycle end markets and/or some continued delays in some energy/petchem-related projects as they slowly transition from orders to revenue as well as modest margin pressure given stranded and stand-up related costs post the spin-off of Advanced Materials and ahead of the separation of HON’s aerospace business. Subsequently, we are modestly lowering our target price to $262 based on ~23x our lowered ’27 estimate. Our target multiple reflects a more focused/streamlined HON portfolio emerging that we think should over time support enduring/solid earnings growth. We are also introducing our 2028 estimates (please refer to our financial model for additional details).

We’re updating our model to account for ITT’s recent equity issuance and to introduce 2028 estimates. We tweak our ‘25/’26/’27 EPS estimates to $6.62/$6.75/$7.35 (from $6.65/$7.40/$8.05); however, we note that our lower EPS is mainly reflective of a timing difference/mechanics related to ITT’s announced acquisition of SPX Flow (~8.1mn shares issued in December 2025; deal close expected by the end of 1Q26). As such, $225 price target is unchanged, now based on ~31x our ’27 EPS (from $225 based on ~30x our prior ’26 EPS) as we think most investors will “look through” potential N-T timing related pressure on EPS given the upcoming expected close of the SPX Flow acquisition.

We are maintaining our ‘25/‘26/’27 Adj. EPS estimates of $3.28/$3.60/$3.90, while increasing our target price to reflect a slightly higher market valuation P/E multiple, and our thought process that industrial short cycle markets have a higher probability of turning more positive in 2026, especially in 2H26. Our updated model incorporates the recently announced Scinomix, Inc. acquisition, while modestly lowering our organic revenue assumptions to account for some lingering demand-related headwinds in the near-term. That said, we believe several of the current headwinds, including tariff/pricing-related timing impacts, are likely to ease over time, with the potential for a short-cycle improvement in ‘26. While near-term visibility remains limited, we see a more favorable setup beyond the near-term, which supports an incremental multiple expansion and a raised target price. Our new target price is $98 (prior target price of $94) is based on a raised 25x P/E multiple (previous target multiple of 24x) and is based on our unchanged ’27 Adj. EPS estimate. Additionally, we extend our model to account for our ’28 estimates.

We maintain our Adj. EBITDA and Adj. EPS estimates for MEC, and we raise our price target to $24 (from $21) reflecting a modestly higher EV/EBITDA multiple (from ~7.5x to ~8x) based on an unchanged ’27 Adj. EBITDA. While a broader market rebound for MEC remains difficult to call amid continued softness in select end markets, management continues to execute on “levers” within its control. We also see momentum building in MEC’s critical power and data center vertical (supported in part by the Accu-Fab acquisition), which is the primary reason why we are increasing our valuation multiple. As underlying demand stabilizes, we believe MEC is increasingly positioned for a potential growth inflection in ’26. Additionally, we extend our model to account for our ’28 estimates. Mirion Technologies (MIR.N) Buy | TP US$32.00 from US$33.00 | Price US$25.97 (09 Jan 26 16:00) Andrew Kaplowitz |

EBITDA estimates from $280mn/$318mn to $273mn/$311mn for MIR to reflect slower momentum across RTQA in the Medical segment, as well as softer demand within Nuclear Labs in the Nuclear Safety segment, that we believe could continue to modestly weigh on earnings. While we maintain our EV/EBITDA multiple of 28x, our slightly lowered ’27 Adj. EBITDA results in a target price of $32 (previous target price $33). Additionally, we extend our model to account for our ’28 estimates.

We raise our target price to $1,074 (from $1,006) as we raise our FY27 P/E multiple to ~32x (from ~30x) given increased market multiple and our increased conviction on PH’s ability to deliver solid earnings growth driven by its transformed portfolio, established Win Strategy, and PH’s capital deployment ability (we don’t include Filtration Group in our estimates since the acquisition hasn’t closed yet, but as we mentioned in our initial take, we view the deal complementary to PH’s Filtration business and estimate the deal to be accretive in Year 1 post-close). Our FY26/FY27 earnings estimates remain unchanged.

We lower our ‘26/’27 EPS estimates to $5.35/$6.00 (from $5.40/$6.05) and modestly lower our P/E multiple to 21x (from ~22x); subsequently we lower our price target to $126 (from $135). We introduce a 90-day negative Short-Term View given Citi’s expectation of a “tumultuous” 2026 for US restaurants , which we think could have negative top-line implications for PNR’s WS segments (~2/3 commercial mix) and overall lead to a softer than expected initial 2026 guidance in PNR’s upcoming 4Q25 earnings. That said, we retain our buy rating given what we view as an overall favorable entry point post recent de-rating (trading at ~0.81x NTM relative P/E vs. 5-yr average of 0.88x and 10-yr average of 0.84x) and solid visibility for overall HSD/LDD EPS growth in ‘26/beyond supported by contributions from volume-related growth (Citi’s Credit Card insights ( link

) point to swimming pool sales and supplies +10.9% 4Q25), continued margin expansion evolution from an evolving 80/20 strategy, and continued opportunistic capital deployment. Elaborating more on the restaurant outlook headwind, Citi expects a broader adoption of GLP-1s in 2026, with Citi’s survey work suggesting aggregate US daily calorie consumption could drop 10-20bps/yr over the next 10-yr, which could potentially pose ~1% headwind to restaurant industry sales by 2029. Coupled with slower aggregate population shifts over the next 5-10yrs ( Starting in '33, net immigration is forecasted to be the primary factor driving population growth as deaths outpace births per the CBO

We remove our Short-Term View and update our view with our new Catalyst Watch. Adding Upside 90-Day Catalyst Watch on Dover Corporation (DOV.N) Direction: Upside Duration: Within 90 Days Catalyst: Earnings

We introduce a 90-day positive Catalyst Watch on DOV supported by what we see as a strengthening outlook for organic growth in 2026 alongside solid margin expansion and capital deployment opportunities that could lead to relatively strong 4Q25 EPS and good initial 2026 guidance. We think the company’s exposure to secular high growth/margin markets remain underappreciated by investors (power generation, data centers, CO2 systems, and single-use biopharma represent >20% of sales and are expected to grow DD), and we also see bottoming/positively inflecting demand in select pressured businesses (i.e. refrigeration door cases and vehicle lift, which represent ~20-25% of sales). Additionally, we think DOV's focus on operational improvements should continue driving outsized incremental margins in ‘26/beyond, which coupled with meaningful capital deployment optionality/flexibility (we think highlighted by DOV’s recent ASR) is supportive of our DD EPS growth estimates.

We introduce a 90-day negative short-term view on PNR given Citi’s expectation of a “tumultuous” 2026 for US restaurants (driven by uncertainty around population dynamics and Citi’s expectation of broader US consumer adoption of GLP-1 in ’26), which we think could lead to negative top-line implications for PNR’s WS segments (~2/3 Commercial mix) and an overall softer than expected initial 2026 guidance in PNR’s upcoming 4Q25 earnings. That said, we retain our buy rating given what we view as an overall favorable entry point post recent de-rating (trading at ~0.81x NTM relative P/E vs. 5-yr average of 0.88x and 10-yr average of 0.84x) and solid visibility for overall HSD/LDD EPS growth in ‘26/beyond supported by contributions from volume-related growth(Citi’s Credit Card insights point to swimming pool sales and supplies +10.9% 4Q25), continued margin expansion evolution from an evolving 80/20 strategy, and continued opportunistic capital deployment.

3M Co. is a diversified industrial and technology company with a broad portfolio of products serving general industrial, automotive, consumer goods, electronics, personal safety, security, construction, traffic safety, and energy markets. The company has core technology platforms shared across its three business groups: Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and Consumer. Brands include Filtrete, Thinsulate, Scotch, Command and more. The company is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. Investment strategy We rate MMM a Neutral. Despite a solid portfolio of innovative products/offerings (difficult model for competitors to replicate) and the company's ability to leverage technology/data and data analytics to support margins, we think the current ongoing uncertainty relative to MMM's ultimate level of PFAS-related liabilities could weigh on valuation. However, we note that the potential benefit of management’s increased focus on productivity – initiatives focused on supply chain optimization and manufacturing consolidation – coupled with MMM’s ability to price could drive margins higher and help improve valuation over time. Valuation

Our $181 target price is based on ~20x our 2027 EPS estimate of $9.20. Our multiple balances improving operating execution by the company offset by mixed end market trends and litigation related uncertainty. Our TP is benchmarked against market multiples. Risks To the downside, MMM generates more than ~30% of sales from developing markets. MMM’s Electronics business in particular accounts for a bulk of MMM's Asian exposure, is tied to more volatile trends in semiconductors, TVs, and overall Asian economic growth, and, given the possible continuation of macro uncertainty, could be poised for more moderate growth in the near-term. We also have to keep an eye on MMM’s Industrial business that could weaken beyond expectations if macro uncertainty lingers. Finally, a challenge for MMM from a valuation perspective is the overhang of potential PFAS related liability and its magnitude, particularly if found liable for personal injury. These factors could prevent MMM from reaching our target price.

To the upside, MMM could surpass our target price if MMM's end markets recover faster than our expectation and macro uncertainty ebbs. Additionally, if potential PFAS-related liability were to be mitigated/removed by regulatory action (eg, EPA), then the company could materially outperform our target price. A. O. Smith Corporation Company description AOS manufactures and markets comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas and electric water heaters, boilers, tanks and water treatment products. The company is comprised of two reporting segments: North America and Rest of World. In North America, AOS is the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters, with a leading share in both the residential and commercial markets. AOS's executive offices are located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Investment strategy

We rate AOS a Neutral. We view AOS as having a balanced portfolio of mature businesses and exposure to faster growing trends, although we view the stock as currently representing a fair balance of risk and reward. Additionally, we remain concerned that lingering uncertainty in China combined with other “nits” such as NA commercial boilers potentially slowing and continued (expected) earnings drag from AOS’ tankless water heater factory switch (from China to Mexico) could continue to at least partially hinder AOS’ EPS growth. Valuation

We assign AOS a $72 target price based on 16.5x our 2027 adj. EPS estimate of $4.35. We value AOS at a slight discount to what we view as its peer average of ~20x and note the wide range of valuation for companies in the peer set (from 13x to 48x 2025 EPS estimates) as indicative of idiosyncratic end markets among publicly traded peers. In this context, we view AOS as more stable than competitors with relatively cyclical industrial exposure, but with a lower outlook for growth and margin than peers with more technology-driven portfolios. Risks To the downside, AOS generates ~25% of its sales in China, and if revenue growth/margin expansion experiences higher-than-expected volatility, the shares could underperform our target price. Additionally, we view the N.A. water treatment end market as highly competitive, with low barriers to entry, and could limit AOS's ability to enhance profitability through pricing.

To the upside, AOS could surpass our target price if the company's commercial water heater and boiler businesses recover faster than our expectation. Additionally, if China's economic recovery or N.A. water treatment penetration occurs more rapidly than our expectation, AOS could materially outperform our target price. APi Group Corporation Company description APG is a market-leading business services provider of life safety, specialty, and industrial services in over 200 locations worldwide. APG provides statutorily mandated services to a strong base of long-standing customers across industries, primarily in North America. The company is also a provider of diversified, single-source infrastructure and specialty contractor services, focusing on infrastructure services, specialized industrial plant services, ongoing pipeline integrity management and maintenance of aging systems, and the construction of oil and gas pipeline infrastructure and related pipeline facilities. Investment strategy

We rate APG as a Buy given its exposure to favorable and acyclical end markets such as life safety, Communications-related infrastructure, and Transmission and Distribution. We believe the company can continue to sustain an above industry average growth rate of ~MSD in the LT given secular trends in 5G build out, utility pipeline maintenance and repair, and more stringent fire safety regulations. Valuation Our $49 target price is based on a 18.5x EV/EBITDA multiple applied to our 2027 adj. EBITDA estimate of ~$1,126mn. We think the stock should trade at a premium to the current multiple given relatively resilient end markets (a cyclical recurring revenue model), potential margin expansion opportunities, relatively solid free cash flow characteristics vs. peers, and potential value-accretive M&A. Risks

Risks that could mean the shares fail to achieve our target price include near-term headwind as revenue/utilization for APG’s services are potentially held down by global economic uncertainty, which could result in near-term volatility. Moreover, despite a historical project loss rate of only ~1.5%, future projects, especially those in Specialty Services, could lead to project losses and lumpy earnings. In the long-run, we think potential sizable M&A in new adjacencies could also pose execution/integration risk. Carrier Global Corporation Company description Carrier is a leading global provider of HVAC and transportation solutions, with a strong portfolio of brands including Carrier, Toshiba, Viessmann, Bryant, ICP, Automated Logic, and Sensitech. The company operates globally, with ~52% of 2024 sales in the Americas, 31% in Europe, and 17% in APAC. CARR reports its financials across four segments: Climate Solutions Americas; Climate Solutions Europe; Climate Solutions Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa; and Climate Solutions Transportation.

We rate CARR as a Buy reflecting several key assumptions: 1) CARR’s transformed portfolio + multi-pronged growth initiatives could support accelerating organic growth over the coming years (CARR targets medium-term ~6–8% organic growth CAGR); 2) Viessmann weakness (~mid-teens% of CARR’s FY24E revenue) is a known headwind, and CARR synergies related to Viessman/wider productivity initiatives could largely compensate/offset; 3) Core CARR markets should grow mid-single digits over the next (at least) couple years as U.S. Resi/global transports bottom while Commercial HVAC remains strong (light unitary likely somewhere in the middle). Ultimately, we believe CARR remains a work-in-progress and we don’t expect “straight line” improvement, but the company is well run, in our view, with leading share in one of our favorite end markets, and we see room for further upside. Valuation

Our $70 target price is based on a ~22x P/E applied to our 2027 EPS estimate of $3.20. With financial leverage continuing to moderate, we use a P/E-based approach to valuation, more consistent with how we value CARR’s global peers/competitors on our coverage universe. Our ~22x target multiple is largely consistent with our target multiples for peers with operations in HVAC and building controls markets, and is reflective of the market's multiples trend. Risks Risks to the downside that could push the shares below our target price include potential end-market weakening that is not in our forecast, or operational challenges in a choppy global supply chain environment. To the upside, we think CARR’s end growth initiatives appear to be gaining traction; in a faster or more robust economic recovery than we currently forecast, shares could outperform our target price. Cognex Corp Company description

CGNX is a leading global provider of machine vision products and solutions that address manufacturing and distribution challenges, with the company’s products being used to automate manufacturing/distribution by tracking and inspecting discrete items, such as mobile phones, electric vehicle batteries, and e-commerce packages, by locating, identifying, inspecting, and measuring products. Its products include vision sensors, vision systems, 3D vision systems, barcode readers, barcode verifiers, vision software, and vision tools. Its solutions include alignment, dimensioning, item detection, edge intelligence, logistics barcode reading systems and tunnels, water identification, and tire inspection. CGNX customers operate in end markets, including automotive, logistics, and consumer electronics, and the company operates in the following geographical segments: United States, Europe, Greater China, and Other. The company was founded in 1981 and is headquartered in Natick, MA. Investment strategy

We rate CGNX shares as Neutral. We think favorable long-term demand trends across CGNX’s key end markets (supported by improving automation adoption), a solid portfolio of product/service offerings, and relatively good operational execution could support long-term earnings growth for the company. However, softer/weaker near-term end market outlook, a “show-me” element to the company’s Emerging Customer initiative, as well as current valuation levels keep us on the sideline for now. Valuation

Our $42 target price reflects a 31x target P/E multiple on our 2027 EPS estimate. The premium multiple (vs. S&P as well as close peers) reflects CGNX’s strong positioning in the machine vision end market (which in the longer term remains an attractive end market, in our view) and the company’s potential for strong topline/earnings growth (as a beneficiary of improving automation adoption trends). Over time, we think CGNX could deliver on its long-term targets of strong sales growth and meaningful operating margin expansion but in the near-term we remain cautious given CGNX's exposure to some cyclical/softer end markets and some “show me” aspect with respect to capital allocation. Risks

Softness in demand trends across CGNX’s end markets could linger as macro uncertainty and tariff-induced economic slowdown could lead to CGNX’s customers/potential customers delaying machine vision/automation adoption plans. Budget constraints and complicated technology remain key barriers to automation adoption and that companies (more smaller-and-medium sized) could “stay the course”. CGNX’s revenue is exposed to few large customers (top 2 customers were 20%+ of the company’s total revenue in ’22), which we think creates some choppiness for CGNX’s top line as a material change in capex/opex plans by those large customers could pressure revenue/earnings (as we are currently seeing). International manufacturing footprint could lead to margin pressure if tariffs stay intact.

If the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be more negative than we anticipate, the stock will likely have difficulty achieving our financial and price targets. Likewise, if any of these factors proves to have less of an effect than we anticipate, the stock could materially outperform our target. For instance, a relatively faster turnaround in CGNX’s end markets could lead to a relatively faster ramp-up in the company’s sales/EPS growth vs. our expectation. CSW Industrials Inc Company description

CSW Industrials, Inc. (CSWI) is a well-positioned, diversified industrial company with a strategic focus on providing niche, value-added products in the following end markets: HVAC/R, architecturally-specified building products, plumbing, general industrial, energy, rail transportation and mining. CSWI operates in three business segments: Contractor Solutions (~67% of FY24 Sales), Specialized Reliability Solutions (~19% of FY24 Sales) and Engineered Building Solutions (~14% of FY24 Sales). The company is headquartered in Dallas, TX. Investment strategy We rate CSWI as a Neutral. Given CSWI’s resilient distribution/business model, growth through acquisitions, and focus on high-demand sustainability products, CSWI should continue to drive significant EBITDA/EPS growth, but we see balanced risk/reward given an already high valuation multiple and some potential for macro headwinds to impact CSWI in end markets related to residential/commercial construction. Valuation

Our $333 price target reflects a ~15x target multiple on our ‘28 adj. EBITDA estimate of ~$376mn. CSWI currently trades at a premium valuation compared to its ~9-year average as a public company and industry peers. While we see continued positive growth momentum as likely, with valuation at peak levels since CSWI has been operating as a public company we don’t anticipate much room for multiple expansion in the near term. We do see potential risk that, if results were to deviate from investor expectations, CSWI’s premium valuation could come under some pressure. Our TP reflects the market's multiples trend. Risks

We see a risk of weaker macro trends vs. our base case and/or incremental headwinds related to residential/commercial construction that could negatively impact growth vs. our base case. Additionally, while we see CSWI’s M&A-related growth priorities as likely tailwinds to the top line and earnings growth over time, we do think these strategies could drive increased complexity/execution risk. If the impact on the company from any of these factors differs from our base case expectations, the stock could have difficulty achieving our target price or could increase more than we expect. Dover Corporation Company description

Dover Corp. is a diversified manufacturer and provider of innovative equipment and components, specialty systems, and support services through its three operating segments: Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. End markets include pumps and valves, retail fueling, printing and identification, and retail refrigeration. Top brands include Markem-Imaje, OPW, Anthony, Cook Compression and MS Printing Solutions. The company is headquartered in Downers Grove, IL. Investment strategy We rate DOV shares a Buy. We believe that DOV is poised for improving growth and profitability as inventory de-stocking at both the company and amongst its channel partners appears poised to largely run its course by YE23, laying a foundation for improving orders and production trends more aligned with end market demand.

Additionally, we believe that CEO Rich Tobin is likely to focus on operation improvements and drive margin expansion over the next 1-2 years. DOV’s potential for margin expansion and disciplined capital allocation, in our view, is underappreciated by the Street and could combine to drive solid EPS growth and margin expansion. Valuation Our $231 price target is based on ~20x our 2027 EPS estimate of $11.75. With an increased focus on driving better operational efficiency under CEO Rich Tobin, we see DOV as deserving of a P/E multiple generally in-line with multi-industry peers. Risks Longer-than-expected destocking period and inconsistent or slower-than-expected progress on cost savings and operational excellence programs under CEO Rich Tobin could result in more moderate EPS growth vs our expectations. Also, even with improving execution, slower demand growth and/or an increase in inflationary pressures could hinder margin expansion.

If the impact from the above risks turns out to be greater than we expect, the shares could fail to achieve our target price. Eaton Corp Company description Eaton Corporation (ETN) is a global manufacturer of power control and management systems for a range of industrial and commercial applications. The company operates in five major segments, including Electrical Americas and Electrical Global (industrial and residential electrical components, power distribution and critical power systems), Aerospace (fluid conveyance, fuel systems, and electrical controls for commercial and military aerospace applications), Vehicle (transmissions and clutches for heavy and medium duty trucks, powertrain components, and fluid connectors) and eMobility (electrical components that improve power management for on- and off-road vehicles). Investment strategy

We rate ETN a Buy. We view ETN as well positioned to benefit from favorable demand trends across its Electrical segments, which we think should contribute to ETN organically growing MSD+ in the near and medium term. Coupled with improving profitability (vs. 2020 levels) as ETN executes its cost transformation efforts, we see the company well-positioned for earnings growth over the next several years. Valuation Our $435 target price reflects a ~29x multiple on our 2027 EPS estimate of $15.25. While our target multiple represents a premium to ETN’s primary comps, we anticipate likely outsized earnings growth vs. most peers as ETN continues to execute on its secular demand trends while also becoming more cost efficient as it benefits from ongoing restructuring efforts. Risks

Risks to achieving our target price are as follows: While ETN is less cyclical than it used to be, we think certain end markets (Vehicle in particular) have some underlying cyclicality that could dampen earnings. In addition, while we think US interest rates appear to be on their way down, difficult-to-predict lag effects could result in some potential weakness in non-res (ex-data centers). Finally, while we expect new management to run ETN relatively well, we do think management change could increase execution risk and/or lead to increased stock uncertainty. Flowserve Company description

Flowserve Corp. develops and manufactures precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in its customer's critical processes. The company manufactures and supplies engineered and industrial pumps, seals and valves as well as a range of related flow management services. It also provides automation and services to the power, oil, gas, chemical and other industries. The company operates its business through two segments: Flowserve Pump Division and Flow Control Division. The company is headquartered in Irving, TX. Investment strategy We rate FLS shares as Buy. Aftermarket could stay resilient and provide support in the current environment and over time the company’s focus on its 3D strategy (Diversify, Decarbonize, Digitize) could support growth. Benefits from major improving execution (restructuring/self-help initiatives), though still in early stages of implementation, have started to gain momentum and could support margin over time. Valuation

Our $85 target price is based on ~19x our 2027 EPS estimate of $4.40. FLS has historically traded at ~19x P/E NTM (long-term average range of 8x-29x). Despite some NT caution on the macro environment, we expect FLS’s overall profitability to improve over time given ongoing self-help initiatives. Energy end markets appear to have bottomed, and the company should benefit from its initiatives to diversify its end market exposure as well as broader investments across decarbonization. FLS’s aftermarket business could over time be a key growth driver given solid installed base. As FLS’s self-help initiatives continue to gain traction and execution improves over time, FLS could realize higher growth/better margins. Risks

FLS is ~40% oil & gas vs. mid-teens for the average multi-industrial peer, and FLS’s project OE business is also very late cycle, which means that FLS’s orders/backlog/revenue could be slow to improve. Restructuring/self-help benefits could stall in a slower market growth environment and oil related uncertainty could be a bigger overhang amid a potential global slowdown. These factors could prevent the shares from reaching our target price. Fortive Corporation Company description Fortive is an industrial technology company of businesses that design, develop, manufacture, service and market professional and engineered products, software and services for a variety of end markets with a focus on software-enabled workflows, connected devices / IoT, productivity, safety & security requirements, and demand for safe, high-quality healthcare. The company is headquartered in Everett, WA. Investment strategy

We rate FTV shares as Neutral. We believe FTV has a long track record of value creation with a well-positioned portfolio of businesses that we think could support long-term growth. However, we think relatively mixed end market demand in the near-term and a still somewhat complicated portfolio of businesses, we view current FTV valuation as balanced. Valuation Our $59 price target reflects a 19x P/E multiple on our 2027 EPS estimate, modestly below the recent trading multiples for peer “industrial compounders”. Our multiple reflects FTV's operational prowess and solid market positioning across much of its portfolio in the longer-term (despite N-T macro headwinds/choppiness), balanced by mixed end market outlook and a lack of "M&A premium" in the near-term. Risks

Longer-term, accelerating M&A activity is one of FTV’s key opportunities but we also consider an acquisition-driven growth strategy as riskier vs. a more organically driven growth model. In the near-term, organic growth has begun to recover, but could remain uneven given macro headwinds. These risks could impede the stock from achieving our target price. On the flip side, a faster recovery in select weaker end markets/regions could incrementally support growth and drive share price appreciation above our target price. Gates Corporation Company description Gates is a global manufacturer of highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. The company offers a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers, and to original equipment manufacturers as specified components, with the majority of revenue coming from replacement channels. Products are used in applications across construction, agriculture, energy, automotive, transportation, general industrial, and consumer products end markets. Investment strategy

We rate GTES a Buy. GTES has a significant installed base across its core products in both Power Transmission and Fluid Power driven by more than 80% of products coming from top 3 market positions, and the company’s premium spot in the market and long history help to drive its ~65% aftermarket exposure. Emerging markets represent an opportunity to drive increased growth as well, and fit-for-purpose markets and transitioning from chains to belts in some uses represents incremental growth opportunities as well. Strong cash conversion could also help growth over time, early on through debt paydown and internal investments, and later through M&A. Valuation Our $27 price target is based on ~10x our 2027 adj. EBITDA estimate of $897mn. Gates currently trades below the average of close peers, but we expect the company’s growth, margin and aftermarket exposure relative to peers, over time, to help GTES trade inline with the group average as the company proves its resilience and investors familiarize themselves with the Gates story. Risks

We do not view Gates as high risk given the company’s significant brand equity and the company’s above-average aftermarket exposure, which could drive lower cyclicality relative to peers. A decent amount of GTES end-market exposure is auto-related, which could come under pressure if auto recovers slower than we expect. We do not view leverage levels at present as cause for significant concern, but a decline in Gates' relatively cyclical markets could add some risk given the elevated debt levels compared to peers. If the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be greater than we anticipate, we believe the stock will likely have difficulty achieving our target price. GE Vernova Inc Company description Operating in three segments (Power, Wind, and Electrification), GE Vernova serves the electric power industry, providing products and services used to generate, transfer, orchestrate, convert, and store electricity. Investment strategy

We rate GEV a Neutral. We view GEV as well positioned to benefit from increasingly favorable demand trends across much of its portfolio which we think should contribute to GEV meeting or exceeding its near-term and medium-term ~MSD organic growth target. Coupled with significantly improving profitability (vs. 2023 levels) as GEV implements turnarounds in underperforming portions of its portfolio, we see the company as well positioned for outsized earnings growth over the next several years. That said, given an elevated valuation multiple that we think largely reflects expected favorable demand trends and improving profitability, we view the near-term risk/reward as relatively balanced. Valuation

Our $708 price target reflects a 25x EV/EBITDA multiple on our 2027 adj. EBITDA ~$7.5bn. While our target multiple represents a modest premium to most of GEV’s primary comps, we anticipate likely outsized earnings growth vs. most peers over the next several years as GEV continues to execute a turnaround in its Wind business and significantly improves profitability in Electrification, while also benefitting from favorable demand trends across its portfolio. That said, while we see GEV as well positioned as a leading enabler and beneficiary of energy transition and electrification trends, we view the near-term risk/reward as largely balanced given a relatively elevated valuation. Risks

This stock is High Risk based upon our quantitative model but assigning a High Risk rating is not supported by other qualitative factors such as GEV’s net cash balance sheet, large overall size that should reduce volatility/promotes diversification and, we think, improving level of performance under the former parent GE over the last couple of years, and so a High Risk rating has not been applied. Risk factors that could cause the share price to deviate from our target price include the following: On the upside: growing power demand and potentially accelerating electrification trends, where it is possible that the top line and earnings could outpace our expectations; with higher growth and more substantial margin expansion, we do see a path to potentially $10+ of EPS in 2026.

On the downside: headwinds associated with GEV’s current Offshore Wind backlog lingering and/or being more costly than anticipated; despite what we view as favorable underlying secular trends, GEV could be subject to cyclicality in its end markets or, growth, while positive, could fall short of what appear to be increasingly elevated expectations; a competitive global landscape could also negatively impact results vs. expectations. Honeywell International Inc Company description Honeywell International, Inc. is a diversified industrial company, which manufactures aerospace products, control technologies, power generation systems, specialty chemicals, fibers, plastics and electronic materials. Honeywell’s products and services include components for aerospace and defense, sensing and security technologies for buildings and homes, turbochargers, specialty chemicals, electronic and advanced materials, process technology for refining/petchem, and energy efficient products and solutions for homes, business and transportation. Honeywell operates through four business segments: Aerospace, Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions. The company is headquartered in Charlotte, NC. Investment strategy

We rate HON a Buy given what we view as still solid long-term EPS growth potential despite an uncertain macro environment. Short-cycle weakness should ease over time and longer-cycle end markets (particularly Aero) could stay resilient, and the company remains well positioned in what we view as secular growth markets such as automation, digitalization, and IIoT. In addition, recent structural cost actions could drive better-than-expected operating leverage in a growth environment that we expect to materialize over time. Finally, accelerated cash deployment given an under-levered balance sheet and good cash flow could also contribute to further upside over time. Valuation

Our $262 price target is based on ~23x our 2027E EPS estimate of $11.50. Our target multiple is modestly above the mid-point of HON’s historical valuation range (5yr range ~12-28x) and reflective of the premium (relative to S&P500) we think investors could ascribe to HON’s relatively higher visibility vs. peers, consistent execution in a potentially choppier macroeconomic environment in the near term, and ongoing portfolio separation. Risks Aerospace could stay considerably weak given relatively less frequent flying/reduced business travel despite vaccine availability and weigh on estimates. Additionally, low oil prices could keep demand trends relatively muted in the Energy end market, further pressuring top-line growth. Margins could be under pressure if volumes fail to pick up. Given relatively rich valuations, M&A could be slow or too expensive, hence impacting shareholder returns. These factors could prevent the share price from reaching our target price. IDEX Corp. Company description

IDEX derives ~$2.5BB in sales from more than 40 decentralized businesses on 13 platforms. In general, these businesses compete in niche markets (<$1.5BB) and have high contribution margins (~60%). Core to IDEX’s strategy is organic growth with a target of +200 bps organic growth over end markets. Product development initiatives, central to the organic strategy, favor customization of existing products/capabilities to fit customer specifications. IDEX’s customers generally have long product lifecycles and once IDEX products are designed in, the company typically enjoys a long revenue relationship. Investment strategy We rate IEX as Buy. We view ongoing economic recovery and the company’s favorable positions in differentiated niche markets as supportive of outsized through-the-cycle earnings growth. Solid execution supported by the company’s differentiated culture/business system should result in good operating leverage on topline growth and ongoing capital allocation optionality with likely more active M&A-oriented capital deployment in the near to medium term could support earnings upside over time. Valuation

Our $202 price target is based on a ~23x multiple on our ’27 EPS estimate of $8.75. Our P/E multiple represents a premium to most Multis peers and is toward the high end of IDEX’s historical trading range, but we think is warranted given the company’s strong track record of execution, favorable position in a global economic recovery, and accelerating capital deployment that we think could support upside to EPS estimates over time. Risks In the near term, “managing the recovery” given elevated inflation and widespread supply chain disruptions remains a known challenge.

Accelerating M&A we think should drive upside to EPS expectations over time, but does also increase execution and/or overpayment risk. Finally, we note that while we remain optimistic in multi-year industrial/economic recovery, previously noted broad-based supply chain/logistics challenges could represent a potential “cap” on near-term growth and recent softening of global PMIs, while not overly surprising, remain a watch item as more wide-spread than anticipated slowing in global economic recovery could weigh on top line/EPS growth estimates. If the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be greater than we anticipate, we believe the stock will likely have difficulty achieving our target price. Illinois Tool Works Company description

Illinois Tool Works, Inc. manufactures a diversified range of industrial products and equipment serving the general industrial, automotive OEM, automotive aftermarket, construction, food and beverage, test and measurement and consumer goods markets. It operates its business through seven segments: Automotive OEM, Test & Measurement and Electronics, Food Equipment, Polymers & Fluids, Welding, Construction Products, and Specialty Products. Top brands include Instron, Miller, Hi-Cone, Rain-X, Hobart, and Buildex. The company is headquartered in Glenview, Illinois. Investment strategy

We rate shares of ITW as Neutral. Potential lingering uncertainties such as inventory normalization, elevated interest rates, and increasing capex caution could pose near-term earnings headwinds. At the same time, ITW’s demonstrated track record of good operational execution could support relative margin outperformance vs. some industrial peers, and with ITW having over time evolved into what we think industrial investors view as a “premium” Multi-Industrial company, we think ITW could trade at an elevated multiple on depressed earnings. Valuation Our $271 price target is based on ~23x our 2027 estimate of $11.65. Given ITW’s solid track record of execution, we think ITW shares could trade generally in line with premier Multi Industrials. Risks To the downside, we do have concerns that the consistent execution/margin expansion that ITW has demonstrated could slow as it seeks to increase the pace of organic growth. In addition, rising pricing pressure could lead to potential margin headwinds. These factors could prevent shares from reaching our target price.

To the upside, if ITW continues best-in-class operational excellence and Food Equipment and Automotive OEM segments begin to recover, shares of ITW could outperform our target price. Ingersoll-Rand Inc Company description Ingersoll Rand Inc. provides flow control and industrial technologies globally. The company’s end markets include industrial, energy, medical and specialty vehicle products and services. The company operates in two segments: Industrial Technologies & Services and Precision & Science Technologies. Investment strategy

We rate IR as Buy given our view that greater than expected synergy benefits and revenue growth potentially in excess of an ongoing cyclical recovery could drive EPS growth and share price appreciation. CEO Vicente Reynal has established a track record for improving operational efficiency and we think that post-RMT, IR is well positioned for synergy capture in excess of what we view as relatively conservative management expectations. Further, IR should be able to drive top line growth with its among best in class recently expanded portfolio of compressors, vacuums and blowers as well as by cross-pollination between the legacy IR and GDI businesses. Valuation Our $98 price target is based on 25x our '27 adj. EPS estimate of $3.90. We anticipate IR could re-rate toward the higher end of Multi-Industry peers (~1.3x the S&P) as the potential industrial compounder proves itself out over time. Risks

Risks to achieving our target price include the possibility of weaker-than-expected demand marco related headwinds or potential supply/operational disruptions given a challenging global logistics environment. An accelerated pace of M&A activity also poses the potential for integration related risks/disruptions. These downside risks could prevent the stock from achieving our target price. ITT Inc Company description ITT is a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered critical components and customized technology solutions for the transportation, industrial, and energy markets that manufactures components that are integral to the operation of systems and manufacturing processes in these key markets. ITT products provide enabling functionality for applications where reliability and performance are critically important to customers and the users of their products. The company operates globally with ~40% of 2020 revenue from North America, 35% from Europe, 17% from Asia, and 8% from “Other.” Financial results are reported across three business segments: Motion Technologies (MT), Industrial Process (IP), and Connect & Control Technologies (CCT). Investment strategy

We rate ITT shares as a Buy given what we view as good growth runway supported by ongoing cyclical recovery and favorable long-term end market characteristics across much of the company’s portfolio. In addition, an increased focus on operational improvement under current management should drive sustainable margin expansion runway that supports EPS growth, while strong FCF generation and a healthy balance sheet should support reinvestment into the businesses as well as external capital allocation and cash returns to shareholders. Valuation Our $225 target price is based on a ~31x P/E multiple applied to our 2027 adjusted EPS estimate of $7.35 and represents a modest discount vs. our average target multiple for Multi-Industrial peers that tend to trade at a premium vs. the S&P500. While ITT has historically traded at a discount vs. the S&P500, recent operational improvement and business results have supported a re-rating with ITT trading at a recent ~1.1x relative P/E vs. a longer-term historical average of ~0.95x, and we think this re-rating could continue. Risks

In the near term, managing through a period of significant raw materials inflation and supply chain tightness/variability is a known challenge that we think ITT is well positioned to navigate, but which could hold back the potential for incremental upside vs. near-term expectations. Accelerating M&A, which we think is a high priority for the company, should be accretive to topline and earnings growth over time, but does also increase execution and/or overpayment risk. Finally, we note that the company has exposure to legacy asbestos-related liabilities that, while well managed, do represent long-dated risk exposure. If the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be greater than we anticipate, the stock will likely have difficulty achieving our financial and price targets. Conversely, if any of these factors proves to have less of an effect than we anticipate, the stock could outperform our target. Mayville Engineering Company, Inc. Company description

Founded in 1945 and headquartered in Mayville, WI, MEC is a leading U.S.-based manufacturing partner that provides a broad range of prototyping and tooling, production fabrication, coating, assembly and aftermarket components. Its customers operate in end markets, including heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction, power sports, agriculture, military, and other end markets. Investment strategy We rate MEC as Buy/High Risk (1H). MEC’s unique business model, capital allocation optionality, and margin expansion opportunities should allow it to trade in line with specialty manufacturer peers over time. We believe that MEC can deliver solid results despite the cyclicality of its end markets, which should be supportive of share price appreciation. Valuation

We assign a price target of $24 based on an EV/EBITDA multiple of ~8x our 2026 adj. EBITDA estimate of ~$87mn. We think the stock should trade at a premium to its 5-year historical EV/EBITDA of ~5.4x considering factors including positives such as growth runway, margin expansion opportunity, and capital allocation optionality with negatives such as end market exposure, customer concentration, and market capitalization. Risks We rate MEC High Risk given its small size and concentrated exposure to cyclical markets (Heavy Truck, Construction, Ag, etc.). Given MEC’s markets tend to cycle at the same time and MEC’s small size, we think MEC’s earnings and stock volatility will remain high, warranting a High Risk rating. Risks to our target price include:

Cyclical end markets – MEC's largest end market, Commercial Vehicles, has meaningfully declined since 2020 and continues to be negatively impacted by ongoing semiconductor shortages. Cyclical end markets could also see lingering negative economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic (e.g. CV, construction and large ag). Customer concentration – ~40% of sales concentrated in three customers (as of FY23). Execution risk – a slowing macro and/or a recession could pressure MEC’s customers’ CAPEX plans that could lead to slower growth than we model. Possibly limited trading liquidity – With a market cap of under $300mn, it may lead to increased share price volatility. If the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be greater than we anticipate, we believe the stock will likely have difficulty achieving our target price. Mirion Technologies Company description

Mirion Technologies is a leading provider of detection, measurement, analysis and monitoring solutions to the nuclear, defense, medical and research end markets. Many of MIR's markets are characterized by the need to meet rigorous regulatory standards, design qualifications, and operating requirements. MIR reports its business in two segments: Medical (~35% of FY23 sales) and Technologies (~65% of FY23 sales). Mirion has facilities in 12 countries and serves customers in the Americas, Europe, Africa, Middle East, and Asia Pacific regions. MIR is headquartered in Atlanta, GA. Investment strategy We rate MIR as Buy due to its often market-leading position in ionizing radiation detection technology businesses, improving business mix and opportunities for cost out potentially leading the company to deliver MSD+ organic growth and 300-500bps of margin expansion over time. We also view the company as well positioned to integrate recent acquisitions and pursue a medical industry-focused M&A compounder strategy, which could lead to earnings upside and a multiple rerating over time. Valuation

Our $32 target price is based on ~28x our calendar 2026 adj. EBITDA estimate of ~$318mn (inline with high-growth peers). We believe that MIR presents an opportunity for capital appreciation based on its potential to grow organically, expand margin, and potentially benefit from an M&A-focused compounder strategy over time. Risks Risks that could impede the MIR stock from achieving our target price include: • Potential negative sentiment to nuclear power generation affecting MIR's nuclear power plant end market; and • Execution risk as the company scales and pursues its M&A strategy. nVent Company description NVT is leading global provider of electrical connection and protection solutions operating in segments: Enclosures; Electrical & Fastening Solutions; and Thermal Management. The company operates globally with ~69% of 2022 revenue generated from North America; 22% from EMEA; 7% from APAC; and 2% from ROW. Investment strategy

We rate NVT shares as a Buy given what we view as good growth runway supported by favorable tailwinds as “electrification of everything” trends continue to gain traction and given NVT’s growth-oriented strategies including a focus on innovation/new products, geographic expansion, and growth-oriented M&A related capital deployment over time. Ongoing op margin expansion potential should also be a contributor to EPS growth over the coming years and supportive of share price appreciation. Valuation Our $131 target price is based on a 29x P/E multiple applied to our 2027 adjusted EPS estimate of $4.50. While our target multiple represents a premium vs. NVT’s historical ~mid-teens P/E, we note that the stock has begun to re-rate higher as favorable growth trends increasingly come into focus and we view shares as likely to trade more in line with close competitors/peers which trade largely in line with our target multiple. Risks

In the near-term, moderating growth trends as industrial supply chains “normalize” and lingering macro-economic uncertainty could weigh on incremental upside. Significant exposure (~28% of 2022 revenue) to commercial and resi construction related end markets are also a risk, though our expectation is that favorable demand trends across the company’s Industrial and Infrastructure end markets (collectively ~2/3 of 2022 revenue) could offset potential incremental softening in commercial and resi. Finally, while we view international and M&A-related growth strategies as representing through-the-cycle growth tailwinds, we do see the potential for increased complexity/operational risk as the company pursues these strategies. Parker Hannifin Company description

Led by CEO and Chairman Jennifer Parmentier, Parker Hannifin (PH) is a leading global manufacturer of a wide range of motion control and fluid power technologies for industrial and aerospace applications. The company operates in two main business segments: the Industrial segments (roughly ~72% sales, divided regionally in North America and International) produces hydraulic, pneumatic, and electromechanical components as well as related hoses, valves, seals, and filters for both mobile and stationary industrial applications; the Aerospace division (~28% of sales) was nearly doubled with the acquisition of Meggitt, produces flight controls, hydraulic components, fire & safety and fuel & fluid conveyances systems for the commercial and military aerospace markets. Investment strategy

We rate shares of PH a Buy. We view PH as well-positioned to deliver organic growth in-line with its long-term targets as we think it has properly balanced short-cycle exposure (~25% of FY24 sales), which is likely to recover mid-year in 2025, and longer-cycle/more durable exposure (~75% of FY24 sales). Coupled with continued margin expansion potential as PH continues executing its Win Strategy 3.0 across its business (both legacy and potential acquisition targets), we see the company as well-positioned for earnings growth over the next several years. Valuation Our $1,074 price target is based on a ~32x P/E multiple on our FY27 EPS estimate of $33.15. While our target multiple represents a premium to PH's primary comps, we anticipate likely outsized earnings growth vs. most peers as PH continues executing on its portfolio transformation, driving improvements to underlying profitability and creating shareholder value through its capital deployment strategy. Risks

Risks to achieving our target price are as follows: muted economic outlooks internationally (China and Germany/Eurozone) could put downward pressure on our International Diversified Industrial segment estimates; a combination of short-and-medium term risks in the Aerospace industry could impact the segment's organic revenue (despite solid performance in the past couple of years); and increasing M&A deal sizes (vs. historical average acquired company revenues) could increase potential integration risks on what we think are high expectations (reflected in PH's elevated valuation). Pentair PLC Company description Pentair delivers a comprehensive range of smart, sustainable water solutions to homes, business and industry around the world. Pentair is comprised of three reportable business segments: Pool, Water Solutions and Industrial & Flow Technologies. Pentair is incorporated in Ireland and its main U.S. office location is in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Investment strategy

We rate shares of Pentair as a Buy. Pentair’s top-three position in the highly concentrated pool end market should benefit PNR’s pool business, which is ~80% replacement driven and should see healthy break and fix demand from the larging aging installed base of pools (5.4mn in NA). Additionally, PNR’s long runway for growth in residential & commercial filtration should enable the company to grow as a water pure play with solid incremental margins over time. That said, we think there are risks to Pentair from the company being in the early innings of accomplishing its residential /commercial filtration strategy and what we view as exposure to more cyclical commercial/industrial end markets (~50% as of 2022 sales). Overall, we think Pentair’s stock price represents an opportunity for share price appreciation, although likely remains at a discount to water industry peers. Valuation

We assign a $126 target price to PNR based on a 21x multiple applied to our '27 estimate of $6.00, slightly below Pentair’s peer average of ~25x, with the discount reflecting PNR being in the early stages of expanding into the competitive end market of residential & commercial filtration, as well as exposure to more cyclical commercial & industrial end markets (~50% as of 2022 sales). Risks We view the following risks as material to the achievement of our target price: Reduced demand (particularly in non-res end markets) as well as related impacts on PNR’s production facilities/supply chain could meaningfully mute results in the near term. The company operates in a highly competitive residential & commercial filtration end market, with what we view as low barriers to entry from technology. The company is subject to fluctuation in weather as well as some general macro cyclicality. Also, within the pool end market, we view the pool installed base as slow-growing over time and a sizable customer concentration (~20%).

If the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be greater than we anticipate, we believe the stock will likely have difficulty achieving our target price. Ralliant Corp Company description Ralliant (RAL) is a global technology company that designs, develops, manufactures and services precision instruments and highly engineered products. The company operates through two segments – Test and Measurement (T&M) and Sensors and Safety Systems (S&SS) that comprise of various brands including Tektronix, Keithley Instruments, EA Elektro-Automatik, Qualitrol, Gems Sensors, Setra Systems, and others. Its products include Oscilloscopes, Probes, High-power bi-directional power supplies, advanced monitoring, protection, and diagnostic solutions and customers include engineers at industry leading companies, research institutions, and governments, across semiconductor, datacenter, consumer electronics, automotive, energy storage, aero, defense and space, utilities, industrial manufacturing, and other industries. The company is based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Investment strategy

We rate RAL shares Buy. We think RAL’s separation from FTV should unlock value over time as RAL exhibits some key characteristics for long-term success – solid brand/product portfolio, secular growth drivers, a well-established operating system, and a healthy balance sheet. RAL’s exposure to some cyclical end markets along with lingering macro uncertainty create a challenging backdrop in the near-term, but early signs of demand stabilization/inflection across cyclically softer end markets coupled with margin expansion potential (volume leverage + RBS) and capital deployment optionality should support solid earnings growth potential. Valuation

We have a target price of $61 on RAL that represents a 20x P/E valuation multiple on our 2027 EPS estimate of $3.05. Our target multiple reflects a discount to the company’s comps (currently on average of ~21.5x) but mostly inline with the S&P 500 (currently at ~19.5x) and reflects RAL’s improving earnings growth potential despite some cyclical aspects of its portfolio (vs. other close peers). Risks Based on Citi’s Quant Risk Rating Model, the stock screens High Risk (given lack of trading history) but we don’t believe that a High Risk rating is warranted as we think RAL has been operated (under FTV) as part of a public company and exhibits steady fundamentals that we think will limit significant stock volatility. Risks that could cause the shares to fall short of our target price

: RAL's select end markets and regions have been relatively soft/weak and a potentially elongated challenging demand environment could pressure/extend the path to RAL's sales growth recovery. RAL's relatively high exposure to China and given the growing tensions between the two regions (if not resolved) could lead to a continuation of pressured growth in the region (RAL is not allowed to sell to select customers in China). If overall sales growth and volume characteristics remain soft for RAL over a longer timeframe, margin recovery could be below our model in '26/'27. Trane Technologies Plc Company description Trane Technologies is a global company that provides HVAC products, services, and solutions through its strategic brands Trane and Thermo King. The company operates its business and reports its financials through a regional segment structure comprised of the Americas segment, the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) segment, and the Asia Pacific segment. The company is headquartered in Swords, Ireland. Investment strategy

We rate TT shares as a Buy. We believe there are significant long-term tailwinds stemming from an increased focus on energy efficiency/decarbonization and lowering greenhouse gas emissions that should help support growth. TT's diverse exposure to better-positioned end markets within Multi-Industry (eg, U.S. Commercial HVAC, Transport Refrigeration), improving/strong execution, and solid cash/capital deployment potential should support solid EPS growth over time. Valuation Our $513 target price is based on a ~32x multiple applied to our 2027 adj. EPS estimate of $16.20. We believe the secular tailwind from the rising focus on energy efficiency/climate change and lowering greenhouse gas emissions, combined with solid end markets, should enable a multi-year earnings runway for TT. Risks

Risks to TT not achieving our target price include potential for a steeper pullback in U.S. non-residential construction and/or Transport Refrigeration beyond our expectations. Reasons TT could surpass our target price include if non-residential construction grows beyond our expectation or if the company is able to extract synergies faster/higher than our forecast. Veralto Corp Company description VLTO is a global industrial company focused on water quality and product identification solutions, consisting of two segments: 1) Water Quality, offering analytical instrumentation, treatment equipment, chemicals, and software for municipal, commercial, and industrial water testing and treatment; and 2) Product Quality & Innovation, providing technologies for product coding, packaging, traceability, and color quality assurance for consumer goods and industrial manufacturers. Investment strategy

We rate VLTO's shares Neutral. We remain constructive on the LT outlook for water and product end-markets, which should provide VLTO resilient MSD organic growth over time, though we view VLTO’s current valuation as largely reflecting the longer-term optimism on the company’s ability to capture/deliver growth inline with its LT targets – MSD organic growth, augmented with M&A, and ~30-35%+ adj operating incremental margins. Valuation Our $111 target price is based on a blended SOTP multiple of ~18x EV/EBITDA on our 2027 adj. EBITDA estimate of $1.59bn. We believe our premium multiple (vs other Industrial companies in our space) is justified due to what we view as a high-quality management team running a portfolio with leading positions in attractive niche markets levered to attractive secular growth trends in regulation, sustainability and supply chain digitization. Risks

Key downside risks that could cause VLTO shares to trade below our target price include macro uncertainty lasting longer than expected and continuing to impact demand domestically and abroad, which will in turn hold down VLTO’s earnings. Additionally, inconsistent or slower-than-expected progress on adj operating margin expansion could result in more moderate EPS growth vs our expectations. Lastly, while M&A is an important aspect of VTLO’s strategy, we also consider an acquisition-driven growth strategy as representing a higher level of risk vs. a more organically driven growth model given risks such as the potential for execution/integration mis-steps, or the potential to overpay for targets (amongst others). While we think a LT track record of M&A-oriented growth is encouraging, we do think VLTO’s ability to extend its M&A playbook as a standalone company remains to be seen.

Key upside risks to our TP include: strong organic growth led by better-than-expected macro conditions helping organic growth exceed our MSD LT expectations; VES initiatives taking hold faster than expected and growing incremental margins in excess of 30-35% we are currently modelling; and accretive M&A could be an earnings tailwind as we currently do not forecast inorganic growth. Vertiv Holdings Co Company description Vertiv is a global leader engaged in the design, manufacturing, and servicing of critical digital infrastructure technology that powers, cools, deploys, secures and maintains electronics that process, store and transmit data. It also offers power management products, thermal management products, integrated rack systems, modular solutions, and management systems for monitoring and controlling digital infrastructure. It carries out its operations in the following geographical segments: Americas, Asia Pacific, and EMEA. Vertiv is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, and has ~20,000 employees, 19 manufacturing sites, and 270+ service centers around the world. Investment strategy

We rate VRT as Buy given its industry-leading position in end markets that see secular growth tailwinds, margin expansion potential, and M&A opportunity that could support a multi-year earnings expansion path. With a portfolio of dedicated products and services for power, thermal and infrastructure management, global sales/services capabilities, and ~60% recurring sales on a growing installed base, we expect VRT to grow at an above-industry average rate of HSD+ over the next few years. Valuation Our $220 target price is based on a ~24x EV/EBITDA multiple applied to our 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate of ~$3,680mn. Our ~24x target multiple is modestly higher than VRT’s average peers’ valuation, which we think represents fair value given the increasing potential of generative AI to accelerate the overall data center market and VRT’s medium- to longer-term growth, as well as its improving execution. Risks

The stock screens as High Risk per Citi’s Quant model, but we don’t think a High Risk qualifier is justified due to VRT’s improving execution and visibility into earnings growth given the increasing potential of generative AI to accelerate the overall data center market and VRT’s medium- to longer-term growth. Key risks to our view and TP include: 1) lingering supply chain/logistics headwinds, which could pressure top-line growth, while inflationary pressures could weigh on margin; and 2) there is also some concern over weaker telecom exposure (20%+ of sales) and macro choppiness in China (low teens of sales). If the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be more negative than we anticipate, the stock could materially underperform our target price. Vontier Corporation Company description

Vontier is a global industrial technology company that focuses on critical technical equipment, components, software and services for manufacturing, repair, and servicing in the mobility infrastructure industry worldwide. The company supplies a wide range of solutions, spanning advanced environmental sensors, fueling equipment, field payment hardware, remote management and workflow software, vehicle tracking and fleet management software solutions for traffic light control and vehicle mechanics’ and technicians’ equipment. VNT’s products and services are marketed to retail and commercial fueling operators, commercial vehicle repair businesses, municipal governments and public safety entities and fleet owners/operators on a global basis. Investment strategy We rate VNT shares as a Buy given what we view as good long-term growth potential supported by solid market positions in its end markets and potential for accelerating growth as M&A capital deployment ramps up over the next several years. Valuation

Our $50 price target is based on a 11x EV/EBITDA multiple applied to our 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate of ~$815mn. With an overweighting to retail fueling vs. peers, our price target multiple is modestly below VNT’s overall comp group. Risks While VNT screens as High Risk in our Quant model due to its lack of trading history as a standalone company, given the company’s strong FCF generation and more moderate cyclicality vs. some industrial peers, VNT shares do not, in our view, warrant a High Risk rating. Risks to the downside that could impede the stock from reaching our target price include steeper-than-expected headwinds in VNT’s North American retail fueling business as a regulatory-driven up-cycle nears completion and/or more moderate global economic recovery vs. our current expectations. VNT’s M&A-oriented long-term growth strategy also poses risks related to potentially overpaying for acquisition targets and/or mis-executing merger integrations. Xylem Inc Company description

Xylem Inc. is a leading equipment and service provider for water and wastewater applications with a broad portfolio of products and services addressing the full cycle of water, from collection, distribution, and use to the return of water to the environment. Xylem operates in three segments: Water Infrastructure, Applied Water, and Measurement & Control Solutions. Xylem’s corporate headquarters are in Rye Brook, New York. Investment strategy We rate shares of Xylem a Buy. Favorable long-term trends in XYL’s global water-related end markets should be supportive of good topline trends over time (despite some potential N-T demand choppiness), and we are increasingly confident that XYL’s operational execution continues to improve and should be supportive of continued margin expansion potential, particularly as relatively nascent 80/20 efforts continue to build momentum. Cash deployment optionality could also be a tailwind over time given XYL’s BS strength. Valuation

Our $182 target price is based on 30x our 2027 EPS estimate of $6.00. We believe Xylem’s competitive position, broad portfolio, and self-help opportunities continue to justify a premium multiple compared to the average of its peers (peers trade in the range of 14x-42x of 2026E EPS). Risks We acknowledge some risks relative to XYL’s “normalizing” growth, particularly in Measurement & Control Solutions (M&CS) business given recent commentary indicating some “pockets of softness” in Europe and emerging markets that, coupled with some cyclicality in other portions of XYL’s portfolio (such as Applied Water and Water Solution & Services), could contribute to relatively meaningful quarter-to-quarter volatility in organic growth. That said, if the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be more negative than we anticipate, the stock will likely have difficulty achieving our financial and price targets. Likewise, if any of these factors proves to have less of an effect than we anticipate, the stock could materially outperform our target.

Zebra Technologies Corp. (ZBRA) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of products in the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) industry. Its products include mobile computers, barcode scanners, radio frequency identification devices (RFID), specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification, real-time location systems (RTLS), accessories and supplies, and software utilities and applications. ZBRA also provides machine vision and robotics automation solutions. The company’s solutions help its customers and end-users to digitize and automate their workflows to achieve their critical business objectives (including improved productivity and operational efficiency, optimized regulatory compliance, and better customer experiences). The company operates through two segments: Asset Intelligence and Tracking (AIT) and Enterprise Visibility and Mobility (EVM). The AIT segment offers solutions across barcode and card printing, RFID and RTLS, supplies, and services. The EVM segment focuses on mobile computing, data capture, fixed industrial scanning, and machine vision, services, and workflow optimization solutions. The company is headquartered in Lincolnshire, IL.

Investment strategy We rate ZBRA shares Neutral. We view ZBRA’s strong market positioning and an evolving portfolio of products and services in addition to enduring longer-term benefits from automation/digitization adoption trends as supporting 5-7% over-the-cycle sales growth although still somewhat mixed/cautious consumer sentiment and capex budget tightness combined with discretionary nature of automation spend add to our caution. Additionally, recent M&A assets, while strategic in nature, are still in the “show-me” camp, in our view, and that, combined with somewhat elevated valuation levels, keeps us on the sidelines. Valuation Our $311 target price is based on a 16x P/E multiple on our 2027 adj. EPS estimate. Our target multiple is slightly below ZBRA’s LT average (~18x) and below S&P 500 (2027 expected P/E multiple ~19x), and balances ZBRA’s exposure to some durable LT demand trends and market leadership in key markets with some “show me” elements given some near-term economic

uncertainty, potential for margin expansion (especially given inflation and tariff-related headwinds), and M&A asset contribution. Risks Risks that could cause the shares to fall short of our target price: Uncertain macro environment and discretionary nature of automation spend could slow/delay larger projects as well as limit scaled adoption of ZBRA’s high growth vectors. Softer volume could lead to margin pressure and impact profitability. Tariffs on imports could lead to margin pressure. Higher risk M&A, if failed to materialize, could lead to incremental earnings headwinds. Upside risks to our target price: Continued recovery in demand across ZBRA’s end markets support project activity across larger projects, as well as an increase software, robotics, or vision adoption supporting incremental earnings growth. A US-China trade deal could lower tariff headwinds.

Data current as of 01 Jan 2026 Buy Hold Sell Buy Hold Sell Citi Research Global Fundamental Coverage (Neutral=Hold) 60% 32% 8% 37% 47% 16% % of companies in each rating category that are investment banking clients 36% 40% 28% 40% 34% 35% Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings: Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned. Investment Ratings:

Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign “Rating Suspended” status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—“ and “-“ respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned “Under Review” status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.

The proportion of all Citi Research research recommendations that were the equivalent to "Buy","Hold","Sell" at the end of each quarter over the prior 12 months (with the % of these that had received investment firm services from Citi in the prior 12 months shown in brackets) is as follows: Q3 2025 Buy 33% (61%), Hold 44% (52%), Sell 23% (50%), RV 0.4% (80%); Q2 2025 Buy 33% (63%), Hold 44% (51%), Sell 23% (49%), RV 0.4% (86%); Q1 2025 Buy 33% (63%), Hold 44% (51%), Sell 23% (49%), RV 0.5% (87%); Q4 2024 Buy 32% (64%), Hold 44% (52%), Sell 23% (44%), RV 0.4% (92%). For the purposes of disclosing recommendations other than for equity (whose definitions can be found in the corresponding disclosure sections), "Buy" means a positive directional trade idea; "Sell" means a negative directional trade idea; and "Relative Value" means any trade idea which does not have a clear direction to the investment strategy.

This tool can be found in the Data & Analytics section under any of the asset class menus in CitiVelocity (https://www.citivelocity.com/). For further information contact CitiVelocity support (https://www.citivelocity.com/cv2/go/CLIENT_SUPPORT). The source for all referenced prices, unless otherwise stated, is DataCentral, which sources price information from LSEG Data & Analytics.

Clients may receive published research reports by email, on a discretionary basis, and only after such research content has been broadly disseminated. Certain research is made available only to institutional investors to satisfy regulatory requirements. The level and types of services provided by Citi Research analysts to clients may vary depending on various factors such as the client’s individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communications from analysts, the client’s risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g. market-wide, sector specific, long term, short-term etc.), the size and scope of the overall client relationship with the Firm and legal and regulatory constraints.
