The AI savings theme has received increasing attention from investors over the last two months. Among European logistics names, we believe DSV is best positioned to improve profitability via AI (Road productivity improvement via AI). We increase our mid-term EBIT by 10% to reflect our AI benefits forecasts. We see the CMD (12th May) as a main catalyst for the stock. We expect the company will provide mid-term EBIT/GP conversion targets and see scope for targets of >55% in Air and Sea and >35% in Road - an upside of ~5% vs. current consensus expectations. At the same time, we believe the Schenker synergies targets could be increased to >DKK 10bn (current target >DKK 9bn). On our FY28 EPS estimates of DKr 109/sh (VA cons DKr 101/sh, BBG DKK 103/sh), DSV trades on 16x 2028 P/E. This compares to the historical 12m fwd average P/E of 21x.

We increase our PT to DKK 2,050/sh (prior DKK 1,700/sh). Buy.

We believe AI could improve EBIT via two main levers: i) improving conversion via headcount reduction (Fig 1-8); and ii) improving gross margins (Fig 9-11). We look in detail at the sensitivies around different scenarios of white collar headcount reduction and gross margin improvement. In our base case, we forecast ~DKK 3bn of AI-driven cost reduction with circa DKK 2bn in Road and DKK 1bn in Air and Sea. We address in more detail the backdrop for AI productivity improvements in our recent expert call; link.

In recent years, the role of a freight forward operator has moved from a jack-of-alltrades to a more specialised role enabled by increases in operations and support staff. Between 2010-2019, DSV Air and Sea reduced production costs per unit by 23-30% amid 2-3x volume growth, driven by operating leverage. Production costs increased by 19-39% from 1Q19 to 1Q25 despite a ~2x increase in volumes (Fig 15-22). We believe the lack of operating leverage observable over the last 5-6 years is a function of: i) increase in support & operations staff; and/or ii) increase in value-added services sold. The former implies in our view that AI productivity solutions mid-term can be supportive in restoring the historical operating leverage. The latter suggests more limited scope for cost cutting, but justifies a higher GP/unit vs. pre-Covid levels.

The increase in our DCF- and multiple-based PT reflects our forecasts of EBIT tailwinds from AI that raise our mid-term EBIT/FCF estimates and rolling over our valuation.

We see two main levers to improve productivity via AI: 1. EBIT/GP conversion improvement via headcount reduction; and 2. improving gross profit margins.

Especially in Road, we see an opportunity to improve the gross margin as a reflection of better utilising the network, improving the load utilisation of the trucks and reducing the empty miles km. We assume less than 25% of the AI savings will be derived via gross margin improvement. We discuss sensitivities around different scenarios below.

Between 2010 and 2019, DSV Air and Sea production cost per unit (cost between GP and EBIT) came down by between 23-30% in an environment of 2-3x increase in volumes. This was mainly a function of operating leverage. Since 2019, we estimate production cost ahead of the Schenker acquisition was up 19-39% despite a circa doubling of air and sea volumes. While we acknowledge that abnormally high inflation over recent years

has represented a headwind to production cost, we believe this alone can't justify the development. We believe the lack of operating leverage observable over the last 5-6 years is a function of: i) increase in support staff; and/or ii) increase in valueadded services sold. The former implies in our view that AI productivity solutions midterm can be supportive in restoring the historical operating leverage. The latter suggests more limited scope for cost cutting, but justifies a higher GP/unit vs. pre-Covid levels. Figure 15: DSV airfreight volumes up c.105% from Q1-2018 to Q1-2025, pre-Schenker acquisition; volumes are up c.227% from Q3-2018 to Q3-2025, post-Schenker acquisition Source: UBSe.

Our DCF and relative valuation framework yields a fair value of DKK 2,050/sh. Our PT increase reflects our forecasts of EBIT tailwinds from AI that increase our mid-term EBIT/FCF estimates and rolling over our valuation. We use a 7.2% WACC and ~2% long term growth rate. Our DCF valuation yields a fair value of DKr 2,079/sh (vs. prior DKr 1,850). On a relative valuation basis, we apply a 22x P/E multiple on our FY28 estimates (post synergies) which we discount back ~2 years yielding a fair value of DKr 2,018 (vs prior DKr 1,550/sh which was based on our 2026 estimates). The weighted average of the two methodologies yields a fair value of DKr 2,050. Figure 25: We use a DCF and multiple valuation that yields a fair value DKK 2,050/sh vs. prior DKK 1,700/sh. Main DCF assumptions below.

Founded in 1976, DSV is a Danish-based global freight forwarding and contract logistics company, with more than 60,000 employees in more than 90 countries. The company is ranked 2nd in Air and 3rd in Sea globally. DSV has grown organically and via acquisitions: DFDS Transport (2000), Frans Maas (2006), ABX Logistics (2008), UTi (2016) and Panalpina (2019). The company has a good geographic diversification with 62% of group revenues generated in EMEA, 21% in Americas and 17% in APAC.

Risks for DSV include, but are not limited to, volatility in European road freight volumes as well as in global air and sea freight, significant increases or decreases in freight rates, global and localised GDP/Industrial Production growth, union intervention, regulatory intervention and significant event risk, including mergers and acquisitions. In addition, the negotiations of contracts in third-party logistics are opaque and margin risk is a constant threat as customers as well as competitors erode profitability. All these sources of risk could severely affect DSV and hence might impact on profitability. Our price target is derived using the weighted average of a DCF (WACC 7.2%, long-term growth rate 2%) and FY28E EV/EBIT multiples discounted back to today's value.
