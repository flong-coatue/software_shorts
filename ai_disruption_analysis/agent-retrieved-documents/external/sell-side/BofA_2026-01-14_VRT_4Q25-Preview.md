Price objective basis & risk Vertiv (VRT) We base our $210 price objective on a 24x EV/EBITDA multiple of our 2027 estimates. Our target multiple is at a premium to the 17x peer average on 2026E and to the 15x average in 2027E. We argue a premium is warranted given above-peers earnings growth. Downside risks to our price objective are 1) declines in company-owned data center spending, 2) inability to execute on capacity expansion plans, 3) newer entrants in liquid cooling offering gaining traction, and 4) reductions in data center capex by cloud providers.

Vertiv 4Q25 preview: forecast 45 % y/y orders growth to $3. 4 bn Our $3.4bn orders forecast is in line with Visible Alpha consensus at $3.4bn (range: $3.0-3.6bn). This would be +45% y/y organic, but down 6% q/q from 3Q ' s $3.7bn haul. W e are raising our 2026 adj. EPS by $0. 22 to $ 5.22 to reflect the close of the Purge Rite acquisition (12/5; $1bn purchase price) . We raise our price objective by $10 to $210, based on 24x (unchanged) our raised 2027E EBITDA. Our target multiple is at a premium to the 17x peer average on 2026E, given above-peers earnings growth. Reiterate Buy . Nvidia commentary sparks debate on data center cooling At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) Nvidia ' s CEO Huang said the Rubin chip could accept higher temps for liquid cooling . He said, " With 45 ° C [113 ° F] , no water chillers are necessary for data centers. "

Even with a dedicated heat rejection loop for the liquid cooling system, we argue chillers are necessary for air cooling and for hot and humid conditions. Higher temperatures are a known factor for chip failure. Our industry channel checks suggest a " go slow " approach to raising liquid cooling temperature set points. Expect 2026 guidance to bracket consensus This will be first quarter with new CFO Craig Chamberlin after David Fallon ' s retirement in Nov. We expect management ' s conservative guidance philosophy to remain unchanged. We expect initial 2026 guidance to bracket consensus ($2.8bn EBITDA). The " new news " will be the framework for full-year orders guidance . We forecast $14.5bn in 2026E orders (+12% y/y , or a ~$3.6bn/quarter run-rate) versus consensus of $15.0bn.

Vertiv product revenue versus equipment assets Source: BofA Global Research, company filings BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Nvidia's CES commentary Nvidia CEO sparks debate on data center cooling At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) Nvidia ' s CEO Huang shared new details on the Vera Rubin platform, which is expected to start shipping in 2H26. He said, " The air that goes into it is about the same. And very importantly, the water that goes into it is the same temperature, 45 ° C [113 ° F]. With 45 ° C, no water chillers are necessary for data centers. " Liquid cooling loop temperatures already high Liquid cooling systems circulate a coolant (typically a water glycol mix) in a closed loop. The coolant flows from the coolant distribution unit (CDU), to the chip ' s cold plate, then to a liquid-to-liquid heat exchanger, where heat is transferred to the facility water loop before returning to the CDU. The CDU does not actively cool the liquid; it just transfers heat to the facility water loop. Existing CDU loops operate with set points ranging from 40-50 °

C. For example, the Vertiv CoolChip CDU070 recommends 42 ° C and is used to cool the current GB200 NVL72 rack. Chiller set points control air temperatures A chiller is a cooling equipment which removes heat (typically via vapor compression) from a coolant (typically water) and circulates it throughout the buildings. This chilled facility water runs through coils and fans to create cold, dehumidified air. The set point for the facility water loop is different than for the technology/CDU loop. The chiller set point determines the air temperature inside a building, and therefore would be well below 45 ° C [113 ° F], typically around ~10 ° C [50 ° F]. Chillers still needed for air cooling We argue that, even if a data center had a dedicated heat rejection loop for technology/CDU, it would still require a chiller for air cooling. Water-cooled chillers provide efficient cooling at scale, which is why they are preferred in larger buildings. Air-cooled chillers are 20-25% less expensive but are typically less efficient and have shorter useful lives.

Higher temps increase chip failure rates A common rule in the semiconductor industry is that every 10 ° C doubles the failure rate of semiconductors. Given the cost of the chips and failures, data center designers and operators will likely set conservative temperature set points and continue to size cooling equipment for lower set points. We note that the Nvidia B200 ' s specification sheet gives standard operating temperatures of 10-35 ° C [50-95 ° F].
