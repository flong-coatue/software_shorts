We update our model to reflect today's results and the faster-than-expected closing of the Schenker integration. While we pull forward realised synergies from FY27+ into the years FY26 and FY27, which raises profitability, the more cautious trading outlook provided by the company mostly erases these gains, so that our estimates remain broadly unchanged on the EBIT level. Equally, the updated phasing of integration costs, which are booked below the EBIT line, pulls down our FY26 EPS estimates, but lifts our FY27 EPS by a similar amount. We still arrive at a higher target price of DKK2,100 as we believe the market is willing to pay a higher multiple for the successful Schenker integration, as well as potential AI gains. As described in yesterday's sector note (link), we are sceptical for now on AI's ultimate benefits, but as DSV's current valuation does not look aggressive, we see additional room for the stock to run.

▪ We mostly keep our mid-term EBIT forecasts unchanged, as earlier than anticipated realisation of synergies and a weaker trading outlook mostly cancel each other out. ▪ We raise our valuation multiple to 18x two-year forward EV/EBIT, which is more in line with the sector multiple, as the latter already reflects positive sentiment towards AI, thanks to DSV's US peers. ▪ Our new estimates are slightly ahead of Visible Alpha consensus estimates.

▪ DSV guided for ~DKK4.2bn in synergies in 2026 and ~DKK4.0bn in 2027. We previously estimated about ~DKK3.2bn and ~DKK3.7bn in synergies for these years and another ~DKK1.3bn in 2028. ▪ At the same time, we reduce our yield assumptions for air and sea freight by about -7%, which mostly eats up the synergy gains. Almost half of the decline in yields can be attributed to FX headwinds. ▪ While our long-term EBIT forecast for air and sea remains permanently lower than previously modelled, this is mostly compensated for by the impressive progress DSV makes in Road freight and what seems like a genuine underlying recovery in the European Road freight market. ▪ We stick to our view that DSV might resurrect the share buyback program in H2 2026 already. Our net debt/EBITDA figure, including share buybacks, drops to 2.2x by the end of FY26 and would be very close to 2.0x without share buybacks.

- ▪ We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our target price to DKK2,100 from DKK2,000 previously. The target price increase is driven by the higher multiple freight forwarders currently fetch in the market. DSV

Most of our changes relate to the accelerated phasing of synergies that are now expected to fully arrive by the end of FY27. In addition, we slightly reduce our group EBIT estimates in the long run as we aim to be conservative on the yield development. While we believe Q4 yield performance can be considered through cycle results, given the overall volume development, upside might be limited due to the weakening Dollar.

By now, DSV is trading below historical multiples and the sector, especially as its US peers pull up the sector valuation. In our view, the market undervalues DSV, as the company's prospects have improved materially compared to pre-pandemic levels, thanks to improved profitability and the DB Schenker acquisition.

DSV is engaged in the provision of transport and logistics services. Its operations are divided into three areas: 1) Air and Sea specialises in the handling of air and sea freight to destinations around the world, 2) the Road business offers land transportation across Europe, the US, and South Africa, 3) Solutions specialises in logistics solutions across the entire supply chain. The company, based in Denmark, is active globally.

n DSV's main equity story going forward will centre on the integration of DB Schenker. n In addition to Schenker, AI emerges as a second pillar of DSV's equity story n We believe that the trade war and more complex globalization environment will ultimately be beneficial for DSV

- n We expect DSV to provide the market with more details on the benefits of the DB Schenker acquisition, AI and potential share-buybacks at the CMD early in 2026.

n Impressive track record of value-accretive M&A deals. n Attractive platform for sellers of private competitors. n Proprietary tech stack enabling smooth volume onboarding. n Strong management team

n Continued active role in industry consolidation. n Increasing complexity of supply chains. n Higher levels of logistics outsourcing. n Fragmented freight forwarding market. Price performanceSales split by regionSales split by divisionFCFSales and EBITDA marginFCF and Capex to sales

- n Our target price is based on a blend of a DCF and a forward EV/EBIT target multiple.

n M&A integration mishaps (e.g. impairments, missing of synergy targets) would be a clear risk for our valuation methodology. n A 1929-style trade war would clearly put our estimates at risk. n An unexpected further normalisation of GP/volume yields to pre-pandemic levels would mean downside risk to our estimates.

n Not yet the global market leader in any transport mode. n High level of goodwill limiting tangible equity. n Underweight presence in growth areas of APAC. n Customer churn after major deals often a headwind for organic growth.

n Increase in M&A multiples limiting number of value-accretive deals. n Significant integration errors would put the equity story in question. n Disintermediation through technologies like blockchain. n Competitive threats of lateral entrants like Amazon or ocean carriers.

Unless otherwise stated in this report, target prices and investment recommendations are determined based on fundamental research methodologies and relies on commonly used valuation methodologies such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), valuation multiples comparison with history and peers, Dividend Discount Model (DDM). Valuation methodologies and models can be highly dependent on macroeconomic factors (such as the price of commodities, exchange rates and interest rates) as well as other external factors including taxation, regulation and geopolitical changes (such as tax policy changes, strikes or war). In addition, investors' confidence and market sentiment can affect the valuation of companies. The valuation is also based on expectations that might change rapidly and without notice, depending on developments specific to individual industries. Whichever valuation method is used there is a significant risk that the target price will not be achieved within the expected timeframe. Unless otherwise stated, models used are proprietary. Additional information about the proprietary models used in this report is accessible on request.

KEPLER CHEUVREUX' equity research policy is to update research rating when it deems appropriate in the light of new findings, markets development and any relevant information that can impact the analyst's view and opinion.
