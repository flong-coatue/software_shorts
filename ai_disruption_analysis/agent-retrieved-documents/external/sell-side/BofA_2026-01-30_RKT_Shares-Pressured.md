Price objective basis & risk Rocket Companies, Inc. (RKT) Our $25 PO is based on a 19x PE multiple to our 2027 EPS forecast. A 19x PE multiple is above mortgage comps currently and the historical range for mortgage originators. We think the premium is warranted given expectations for a larger market prospectively, attractive recent acquisitions, as well as for RKT's superior technology and brand. Downside risks to our PO are: 1) lower-than-forecast origination volumes or gain-on-sale margins, 2) macroeconomic risk from a weaker-than-expected recovery or a downturn in the housing market, 3) regulatory changes, 4) execution risk, and 5) complex ownership structure and limited float.

Upside risks to our PO are: higher-than-forecast mortgage origination volumes or gain-on-sale margins, a stronger-than-expected housing market backdrop, and faster market share gains than expected. There is also risk RKT utilizes its strong balance sheet for M&A, dividends, and buybacks, which could improve sentiment and valuation for the shares.

Rocket Companies, Inc. Prepayment speeds and competition spook investors Shares of Buy-rated Rocket (RKT) were indicated sharply lower (approx. 7%) in the aftermarket yesterday. We believe RKT shares are down in sympathy with mortgage originator PennyMac Financial (PFSI, Not Covered ) which reported below-consensus 4Q results after the close and saw its own shares pressured (approx. -23%). Specifically, PFSI reported adj. EPS of $1.96 vs. consensus at $3.23. PFSI highlighted higher pre-payment speeds and increased competition in mortgage originations as key factors for its underperformance. Investors fear RKT will be impacted by these f actors as well, which we acknowledge is possible and arguably

even likely. That said, RKT is, in our view, a best-in-class originator with a strong brand which should help RKT withstand competitive intensity better than others. RKT has also historically been able to recapture at a higher rate than PFSI, which should mitigate the impact of higher servicing portfolio prepayments. Reiterate Buy. Competitive intensity could limit upside PFSI noted industry participants had added capacity in anticipation of lower mortgage rates and this excess capacity has limited margin increases (pricing power) typically associated with lower interest rates. As a result, earnings growth in the origin ation business did not offset higher level s of run-off from the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio for PFSI. Our take: RKT will also be subject to similar competitive dynamics, and this could limit increases in gain-on-sale margins. We note that we are not forecasting material increases in margins in our model (<10bps over 2yrs), but we

do acknowledge margin pressure would be a negative. RKT has a much larger consumer direct business (higher margin) than PFSI, which is more weighted to correspondent (lower margin). Also, RKT has a larger origination business and higher recapture rates which should reduce the impact of lower servicing fees on overall results (relative to the impact on PFSI) particularly if it executes on high levels of recapture from the mortgages prepaying. MSR run-off could pressure servicing income PFSI noted that prepayments in its servicing book and in the market were at a faster level than it had expected. This led to a 32% q/q increase in the realization of MSR cash-flows line item, which is a conta-revenue for loan servicing income. PFSI expects this level of MSR cash-flow realization headwind to continue into 1Q. Our Take:

Faster prepayments will impact RKT as well and could pressure loan servicing income. As seen in Exhibit 1 inside, RKT experienced an uptick in MSR cashflow run-off in 3Q already. The acquisition of Mr. Cooper also materially increases RKT ' s exposure to loan servicing income and headwinds from faster pre-payments (it also increases the recapture opportunity/potential).
