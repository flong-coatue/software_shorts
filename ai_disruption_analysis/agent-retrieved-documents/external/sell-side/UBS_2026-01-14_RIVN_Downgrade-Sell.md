We downgrade RIVN to Sell, $15 PT seeing a less favorable risk/reward. RIVN stock has been prone to sentiment swings (often driving stock more than fundamentals) and the stock is +15% since Autonomy and AI Day on Dec. 11 (vs. S&P500 +1%) as the market assigned more enthusiasm to their AI potential. However, in our view, most of the AI related news is 'out'. The other point of enthusiasm is the launch of the R2 and while we like the vehicle, expectations may be too high; our 2026/27 sales forecast is 16/19% below consensus, and current stock prices in '27 sales ~25% above UBSe. We see ~20% downside in our base case ($15 PT) and a ~1.6x downside to upside negative skew.

We see limited autonomous catalysts near-term as point-to-point (P2P) capabilities are not until 2H26 and 'eyes-off' not until 2027. Further, while some investors expressed enthusiasm for the potential to sell/license their AV tech to other OEMs, we saw two developments at CES that could dampen hope: 1) the release of Nvidia's open sourced Alpamayo model, 2) Ford developed their own L3 P2P system in-house.

Our 26/27 R2 forecasts are ~22/7% below consensus. Recall, R2 is scheduled to start in 1H26. However, Gen 3 hardware available late '26. We believe early customers are likely current RIVN owners or early adopters, and we see risk they wait for the latest and greatest R2 (that may be available ~2 qtrs later). Further, we see a tougher US BEV environment with the absence of the EV tax credit and a pull back in regulations, which means R2 will compete against broader ICE/hybrid offerings, not just BEVs. We do see an opportunity for R2 to capitalize off customers changing from Tesla. Our 2026 R2 forecast is 10.6k vs. consensus at 13.6k (S&P production forecast is only 6.1k). We forecast R1 units -7% y/y (pre-buy giveback, no EV credit, high lease rate) vs. consensus that has R1 +10% y/y. Further, we see cost pressure from DRAM and lithium pricing.

1) Sentiment/momentum could continue to trump fundamentals leading to multiple expansion; 2) R2 demand and production is stronger than we forecast; 3) RIVN is able to license more of their technology.

We now apply a 2.5x EV/sales multiple to our 2027 sales estimate from 2.0x prior. 2.5x is below current NTM of ~3x, but at the +1 st. dev. level over past 3-years. We believe 2.5x balances near-term concerns with long-term potential.

We don't think so. When we dive deeper into the components, the Street's ~65k estimate has R1 deliveries +10% y/y and RCV deliveries +31% y/y in a year where EV demand will very likely be lower given the removal of the EV tax credits and other rollbacks in EV regulation. Further, UBSe is ~22% below Street on 2026 R2 deliveries (UBSe 10.6k vs. consensus at 13.6k). Given the release timing of Rivian's Gen 3 platform in 2H26, we see a reasonable probability that meaningful R2 volumes won't materialize until 4Q26. Further, 2027+ delivery expectations also look elevated to us.

We think it's unlikely. Recall, this target was initially provided at the company's Investor Day in 2024 and had embedded production of ~200k units, which implicitly assumes near full utilization at Normal. We also believe this target assumed some level of benefit from the consumer EV tax credit (on the demand side) as well as selling ZEV credits, both of which are now headwinds vs. the initial guide. Further, given US EV demand challenges as well as affordability concerns, we could see pricing actions to mitigate losses in demand. Note the target now includes the VW JV benefit (and didn't initially), but visibility is less clear here. We forecast 2027 EBITDA loss of -$1.3bn vs. consensus of $700mm, and we don't see EBITDA breakeven until 2029E.

We are Sell rated on RIVN. We remain positive on the company's products and brand, but we think elevated expectations at the current valuation present a poor risk/reward. US EV demand will very likely slow going forward, and we see further potential impediments to EV demand (such as affordability) that make investing in a loss-making EV OEM challenging.

The removal of the ~$7.5k EV tax credit is very meaningful as it not only impacts qualified EVs financed, but also all EVs leased. Our analysis shows that from 1Q-3Q25, ~75% of R1 vehicles that Rivian delivered were leased. While it's likely that not all of this business will disappear, the tax credit removal represents a ~9-10% increase to the "net" price consumers were previously paying, which will likely impact R1 demand going forward, in our view. On R2, the Gen 3 hardware won't come until late '26. We believe early customers are either current RIVN owners or early adopters, and we see risk they wait for the latest and greatest R2 (that may be available ~2 qtrs later), which will likely lower 2026 R2 deliveries. Using our target multiple of 2.5x 2027e EV/Sales, the current stock price implies 2027 sales of ~ $11.6bn, ~25% above UBSe of ~$9.3bn.

Pivotal Questions

We don't think so. When we dive deeper into the components, the Street's ~65k estimate has R1 deliveries +10% y/y and RCV deliveries +31% y/y in a year where EV demand will very likely be lower given the removal of the EV tax credits and other rollbacks in EV regulation. Further, UBSe is ~22% below Street on 2026 R2 deliveries. Given the release timing of Rivian's Gen 3 platform in 2H26, we see a reasonable probability that meaningful R2 volumes won't materialize until 4Q26 at the earliest. Further, 2027+ delivery expectations also look elevated to us.

The removal of the ~$7.5k EV tax credit is very meaningful as it not only impacts qualified EVs financed, but also all EVs leased. Our analysis shows that from 1Q3Q25, ~75% of R1 vehicles that Rivian delivered were leased. While it's likely that not all of this business will disappear, the tax credit removal represents a ~9-10% increase to the "net" price consumers were previously paying, which will likely impact R1 demand going forward, in our view. On R2, the Gen 3 hardware won't come until late '26. We believe early customers are either current RIVN owners or early adopters, and we see risk they wait for the latest and greatest R2 (that may be available ~2 qtrs later), which will likely lower 2026 R2 deliveries.

Using our target multiple of 2.5x 2027e EV/Sales, the current stock price implies 2027 sales of ~$11.6bn, ~25% above UBSe of ~$9.3bn.

US EV demand is likely to slow in 2026 given the removal of the EV tax credits and other rollbacks in EV regulation. RIVN is in a particularly difficult spot as their vehicles compete in the premium tiers. The entry level R1T begins at ~$73k while the entry level R1S begins at ~$77k. This compares to the US EV average transaction price (ATP) of ~$58k and the overall average US vehicle ATP of ~$49k. While the R2 is coming with a starting MSRP of $45k, we believe that initial trims could be closer to $55k. Further, we see risk to 2026 consensus R2 delivery forecast (see below). UBS forecasts 2026 US BEV sales 30% y/y (~5-6% of total US sales vs. ~8% in 2025). Figure 1: UBS forecasts ~5-6% US BEV mix in 2026 Source: Autodata, UBSe

Consensus has 2026 R1 deliveries growing +10% y/y to ~37k. We believe this is optimistic. According to Experian, ~70% of R1S sales in 2Q25 were leased, ~81% in 3Q25, so ~75% within those time periods, on average. Recall, the consumer EV tax credit was awarded for all leased EV sales, including the R1. As such, we believe forecasting any growth at all in R1 deliveries in 2026 is an aggressive assumption. UBSe models a -7% y/y decline in R1 deliveries to ~30k. To sense check the lease rates above, we run the following analysis:

| R1 Lease Rate Calculation                   | 1Q-3Q25   |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| %of revenue from new EV sales to Chase Bank | 42%       |
| Translated into USDmm                       | $1,722    |
| R1 ASP assumption                           | $89,000   |
| # of R1s leased                             | 19,353    |
| UBSe R1 deliveries                          | 25,337    |
| %leased                                     | 76%       |

Source: Company reports, UBSe. Note: 2024 R1 ASP assumption is notably lower than 2025 given mid-year financing deals to clear out Gen 1 inventory.

Consensus is also forecasting 2026 R2 deliveries of ~13.6k, ~30% above UBSe. But recall, at their Autonomy and AI Day, the Rivian Gen 3 platform will launch on the R2 in late 2026 . We believe the autonomous features will increasingly become a key differentiating point for R2 and help them sell units. However, with the first R2s set to come off the line earlier in 2026, this means that those first vehicles won't have the latest hardware and will ultimately be limited in their functionality versus R2s that will be available months later. In short, the initial R2 vehicles won't be capable of running RIVN's more advanced autonomy features. We believe this could end up leading to some deferred deliveries as many early adopters will want the latest tech. As such, we see a reasonable probability that meaningful R2 volumes won't materialize until 4Q26. It's possible that RIVN does something on initial R2 pricing to help with the feature discrepancy.

Over the past 3-years, RIVN has traded in a +/- 1 std. dev EV/sales range of 1-2.5x with an ~1.8x average. We now apply a 2.5x EV/sales multiple to our 2027 sales estimate from 2.0x prior. 2.5x is below current NTM of ~3x, but at the +1 st. dev. level over past 3-years. We believe 2.5x balances near-term concerns with long-term potential.
