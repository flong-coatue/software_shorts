CHRW's upside 4Q EPS of $1.23/sh vs Consensus of $1.13 (and our $1.10 est) comes against a backdrop of investor debate about a potential downside print considering the sharp rise in December truckload spot rates and potential pressure on NAST GM%. We believe the upside is a genuine surprise against this backdrop of uncertainty. Relative to our model, cost side performance was a key lever in 4Q as operating expense was 6% below our forecast and -8% y/y. Notably truckload volumes rose 3% y/y despite a weak market shown by a -7.6% y/y decline in the Cass Index.

4Q results from several other brokers clearly illustrate the impact of rising 4Q spot rates as shown by the 260 bp and 230 bp sequential declines (4Q vs 3Q) in the brokerage businesses at JBHT and KNX. Commentary from RXO and private truckload brokers has also pointed to significant sequential GM% pressure. Against this backdrop CHRW's NAST GM% fell by only 40 bp to 14.6% in 4Q compared to 3Q (15.0%). We view this performance as providing clear evidence that CHRW's use of AI is enabling differentiated results.

CHRW indicated they have a high degree of confidence in their ability to deliver on their 2026 target of ~$6.00/share of EPS or about 18% growth. The progression of total gross profit growth in 4Q was negative with notably greater pressure in December (12% y/y) compared to -4% y/y for full 4Q. CHRW indicated this was driven meaningfully by pressure on ocean GP and we note the forwarding comparison is easier in 1Q26. We believe the key potential levers for CHRW in 2026E are continued execution on productivity (and Agentic AI in 2HE) and TL volume outperformance continuing.

We continue to apply a 28x P/E to our 2027E EPS of $8.00/share to derive our price target of $224 and we rate CHRW a Buy. We believe the strong execution in 4Q against a difficult backdrop provides even more visibility on CHRW's ability to deliver on their 2026 targets and deliver attractive EPS growth on a multi-year basis.

CHRW's gross profit growth in NAST in 4Q25 was +1.9% y/y (vs +5.6% in 3Q25) which we believe is encouraging, particularly when taking rising spot pressure into account. Looking at the details it was a combination of a -0.4% decline from truckload brokerage and a +6.0% increase in LTL brokerage. CHRW again pointed to the continued implementation of its new operating model which is characterized by strong execution, improving profit per load and market share gains as key drivers of performance in 4Q. We anticipate continuing growth in NAST gross profit and we model 7.6% y/y growth in 2026. We lay out the various drivers to our model in Figure 4 below, and GM% improvement remains a meaningful lever.

We believe it's important to note that management reiterated the 2026 financial targets that were presented during 3Q earnings call. As a reminder - 2026 operating income is expected to grow between $400 mm to $500 mm vs their 2023 adj operating income of $553 mm, resulting in a 2026 operating income target range of $964 mm to $1.04 B. It's important to note CHRW indicated the bottom end of the range assumes zero market growth and would equate to ~$6 in EPS. Management also addressed the company's mid-cycle operating margin targets of 40% for NAST and 30% for Global Forwarding, indicating they are maintaining these targets which will allow them to shift to greater focus on volumes as an additional lever.

In Figure 2 we look at CHRW's NAST TL growth vs the Cass Shipments index growth. As can be seen, CHRW has again demonstrably grown market share vs. 7.6% decline in the Cass Freight Shipment Index. As it comes to quarterly progression, truckload volumes rose 3% in 3Q25 and 4Q25. In the same timeframe, Cass Shipments declined -7.2% and -7.6% y/y. We expect CHRW to continue the outperformance vs. the broader market index and we model TL NAST volume to be +3% y/y in 2026.

In Figure 3 below we look at Forwarding gross profit on a y/y basis. CHRW's Forwarding business continues to remain under pressure from softer volumes and weaker ocean rates, reporting adj gross profit of $178 mm (roughly in line with our estimate of ~$181 mm), with a gross margin of 24.3% (vs our expectation of 25.0%). We note that GM% in Global Forwarding expanded by ~120 bp y/y, which we assign to improved revenue management discipline. As we also learned during the conference call, continued implementation of Lean AI-enabled processes provided a high-single digit productivity increase in Global Forwarding in 2025.

In Figure 4 below, we include our key model assumptions for CHRW following the 4Q print. Our full year 2026E EPS remains unchanged at $6.00. For the full year 2026, we are modelling a 3.3% Y/Y Truckload volume increase and 4.6% Y/Y base pricing, while our Forwarding gross profit is modelled at -5.9% due to weak ocean shipping rates. We believe the brokerage cycle may be in the process of bottoming, although it is unclear when a sustained recovery may begin. For 2027, our EPS estimate remains unchanged at $8.00. Potential drivers of our 2027E EPS include 5.0% Truckload Y/Y base pricing, while our Forwarding gross revenue estimate is increasing 5.0%.

C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) is one of the largest global logistics companies in the world and the largest North American truck broker. CHRW has a network of offices in NA, Europe, Asia, Oceania and South America. CHRW enters into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies - including. motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), and ocean and air carriers - and utilizes those relationships to efficiently and cost-effectively arrange the transport of its customers' freight. Adjusted gross profit is ~46% from Truckload, ~20% from LTL and ~34% from All Other.

Our price target is based on a multiple of EPS. A weaker than expected truckload market would be a source of downside risk to our EPS estimates and price target for CHRW. During the first year of declining truckload spot rates CHRW can support EPS growth with GM% expansion. However a second year of weakness in the truckload market can be a meaningful headwind for CHRW and source of risk to our EPS estimates and price target. Changes in brokerage market technology and rising competitive pressure from new, tech focused brokerage companies is a potential risk for CHRW. Deceleration in market share gains is also a source of downside risk to our EPS estimates and price target for CHRW. Changes in shippers' appetite to use freight brokers could be a source of downside risk to our EPS estimates and price target for CHRW.
