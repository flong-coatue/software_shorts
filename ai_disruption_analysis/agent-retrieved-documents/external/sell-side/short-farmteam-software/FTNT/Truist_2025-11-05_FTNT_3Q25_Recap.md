✓ Earnings Recap ✓ Updating Estimates

FTNT - 3Q25 Earnings Recap: Product Momentum Offsets Service Drag FTNT delivered a strong Q3 with revenue of $1.725Bn (+14.4% YoY) and billings of $1.81Bn (+14.3% YoY), respectively, both ahead of consensus. Product revenue grew 18% YoY to $559M, driven by strength in multi-product deals, OT security, and AI data center wins. Service revenue grew 12.7% YoY to $1.17B, slightly below expectations due to lagging effects from prior-year product softness. While service revenue growth remains muted due to lagging effects from prior-year product softness, the company expects a reacceleration in the second half of 2026 as recent product strength begins to flow through. We adjust our estimates and reiterate our Buy rating and $95 PT.

Mixed 3Q25 Results: Fortinet reported $1.72Bn of revenue, up 14.4% YoY, just below the high end of guidance of $1.67Bn-$1.73Bn, driven by robust product revenue growth of $559.3M (18% YoY). Billings of $1.81Bn grew 14.3% YoY, below the high end of guidance of $1.76Bn-$1.84Bn. Large customer activity remained healthy, with deals over $1M up 26% YoY and total value up +32% YoY. Service revenues came in softer than expected at $1.166Bn (+12.7% YoY) vs. consensus estimates of $1.173Bn (+13.4% YoY), which management attributed to weaker prior period product sales. Non-GAAP operating margin reached a record 36.9%, above the high end of guidance of 33.5% due to operating leverage in the business.

Product Revenue Set-up for Durable Growth: Upside in Fortinet's product revenue was driven by strong performance in multi-product deals across a variety of use cases and deployments including retail, operational technology (OT) security, and AI data center deployments. In prior quarters, management had noted strength from refresh cycles however, in Q3 they underscored the upside was due to broad-based adoption drivers including innovation-led upgrades. Both hardware and software saw strong double-digit growth, with software license revenue up 20% and representing a mid-to-high teens percentage of total product revenue. Despite the strength, management reiterated their expectation of sustaining 10%-15% annual product revenue growth over long-term. Fortinet expects to release its new series of ASIC chips next March, which could provide continued fuel for double-digit product revenue growth through 2026 and beyond.

Service Revenue To Accelerate as Strength in Product Flows Through: Service revenue grew 13% YoY to $1.17B, slightly below expectations, primarily reflecting the delayed impact of softer product sales in prior periods. When looking at services billings Y/Y growth as a leading indicator for the near-term revenue trajectory, it decelerated sequentially after re-accelerating the past three quarters. Management laid out multiple drivers of the divergence, including timing mismatches between hardware and services deployments, as well as outsizes impacts in 2Q25 from Enterprise Agreements that caused some lumpiness. Management reiterated the ~1.5 to 2.5 year lag of services with product cycles. As the recent acceleration in product revenue begins to translate into higher service attach rates, management anticipates a reacceleration in service revenue in the second half of 2026.

Continued Momentum in SecOps and SASE: SecOps ARR grew 24.5% YoY to $472M, while ARR for Unified SASE grew 13.5% YoY to $1.22Bn. SecOps growth continued to be driven by FortiAnalyzer, FortiSOAR, FortiSIEM, and FortiMail. The Lacework acquisition continues to be an overhang on ARR within Unified SASE as customer churn continued to impact growth. Lacework's ARR has declined by almost half since its acquisition last year in August. Management highlighted that 15% of Fortinet's large enterprise customers have now purchased SASE, up from 13% in Q2, representing over 55% YoY growth.

Prudent 4Q25 Guidance: Fortinet issued 4Q25 guidance for revenue of $1.825Bn-$1.885Bn (+11.7% YoY at the midpoint) vs. consensus of $1.875M (+12.9% YoY) and for billings of $2.185Bn-$2.285Bn (+11.6% YoY at the midpoint) vs. consensus of $2.231Bn (+11.4% YoY). The company expects non-GAAP operating margin between 34.5% - 35.5%, vs. consensus of 32%.

Fortinet revised its full-year outlook, retaining the midpoint but tightening the FY25 range to $6.72bn - $6.78bn (12.8% - 13.8% YoY) from the prior guide of $6.675bn to $6.825bn (12.1% - 14.6% YoY). Service revenue guidance shifted slightly lower to $4.575Bn-$4.595Bn (13% - 13.5% YoY) from $4.55Bn-$4.65Bn (12.4% - 14.9% YoY), while billings guidance increased to $7.37Bn-$7.47Bn (12.8% - 14.4% YoY) from $7.325Bn-$7.475Bn (12.1% - 14.4% YoY), reflecting confidence in product momentum. FY25 operating margin was raised to 34.5%-35.0% from 32.0%-33.5%, as the company continues to display operational efficiencies and strong cost management.

Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT) is headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA. The company's product offerings are centered around its core FortiGate offering, which includes firewalls, IDPS, and SWG, which contribute approximately 70% of total billings. Fortinent's wider security fabric includes secure networking, zero trust, cloud security, and threat detection and response. The Fortinet Security Fabric, built on FortiOS, enables multiple security and networking technologies to work together seamlessly across all environments, enhancing its ability to protect an organization through a single source of unified threat intelligence. This holistic approach eliminates security gaps in the network and hastens responses to attacks and breaches. A Fortinet Security Fabric cybersecurity mesh platform approach consolidates point products into a platform, which we believe allows for much tighter integration, increased automation and a more rapid, coordinated, and effective response to threats across the network. The Fortinet Security Fabric has an open architecture designed to integrate Fortinet solutions and third-party solutions.

We rate FTNT shares Buy as we believe it is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing convergence of networking and security. In our opinion, it is also one of the best positioned security companies to benefit from vendor consolidation based on its product breadth. Fortinet has one of the broadest product platforms, in our view, offering a full suite of cybersecurity capabilities including network, cloud, IoT, and endpoint security, enabling customers to consolidate their cyber spend. As companies look at their security needs for 2025 and beyond, we think beneficiaries will be vendors such as FTNT that can provide holistic security solutions as opposed to just tools that address distinct security needs. The company's proprietary Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips are also a key differentiator allowing it to price its products significantly lower than its competition while still delivering industry-leading performance, helping the company achieve a Rule of 49 (Revenue growth + Operating margin), one of the highest on a GAAP operating basis in our cybersecurity coverage. In our view, Fortinet's increasing number of use cases, technology innovation, and

expanding TAM have positioned it strongly for durable growth going forward.

Valuation: Our $95 price target is based on a 10-year combined DCF and multiple approach. We believe that the company can sustain a revenue CAGR in excess of 10% over the 10-year period. This equates to 9.3x CY26 sales versus the peer group average of 11x, and 29x CY26 FCF versus the peer group average of 39x. Risks to our rating and price target: Highly competitive markets may impact ability to take share, acquisition integration risks, cyber threats, and reliance on firewall market.
