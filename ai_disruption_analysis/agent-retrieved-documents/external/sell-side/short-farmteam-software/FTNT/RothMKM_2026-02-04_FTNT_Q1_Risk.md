Earnings Preview February 4, 2026

Channel partner checks were consistent with Q3'25, and qualitative commentary suggested that the company was invoicing until the final weeks of the quarter. Street expectations appear conservative, and we believe FTNT should be able to report Q4'25 Revenues/Billings above Street expectations, but Q4'25 Service revenue estimates appear a bit high. Buyside estimates are higher, and our analysis indicates that FTNT should be able to report revenues and billings ahead of Buyside expectations. However, the risk to Q1'26E revenue guide, and the 2026 OM guide makes us slightly cautious, and we believe the risk/reward is balanced.

For the 2026 guide, we believe revenues and billings should be ahead of current Street estimates, but we see a slight risk to Q1'26 Revenue guide and 2026 operating margin guide. Since its last print, the stock has performed in-line with the CyberSecurity index CIBR (down ~9%) and outperformed the IGV index (down 23%) and has held up relatively well in the recent sell-off. When we analyze what the stock is pricing in at these levels, it does not appear too aggressive.

Our checks indicated consistent momentum and we were told that the company invoiced through the end of the quarter. The stock has outperformed the IGV index after its Q3'25 earnings, and when we analyze what the stock is pricing in at these levels, it does not appear too aggressive, in our view. The stock has also held up relatively well in the recent Security/Software selloff. However, given the risk to the Q1'26E revenue and 2026 operating margin guide, we are slightly cautious.

In addition to speaking to investors and getting a sense of what they're expecting for Q4'25E revenue and billings, we also try to back into what the stock is pricing in at current levels. The analysis below is a 'reverse' analysis where we start with current stock price, assume a reasonable multiple based on peer comparisons, and then calculate what it means for revenue and billings growth assumptions. The broader security and software universe for companies that have mature margins and can be valued on FCF and are trading at EV/FCF/g of ~2.0x (if we exclude outliers like VRNS-NC), hence for a company growing ~10% to 11% topline, it would be reasonable to be trading at ~21x EV/FCF, in our view.

As is typical, expectations we have heard from investors are higher than Street estimates. Given that checks are similar to Q3'25, investor expectations are not too aggressive, in our opinion, and we find that most investors are expecting numbers/beats similar to what we saw last quarter - closer to the midpoint of the guidance for revenues, and a bit closer to the high end of the guidance for billings. These are the ranges we have heard from investors for product revenues, total revenues and billings. For product revenues, the range of expectations is $650M - $662M. For total revenues, the range we have heard is $1,855M - $1,871M with most investors expecting ~$1,860M - $1,865M. For billings, the range of expectations is wide, from $2,268M - $2,280M, with most investors at ~$2,275M - $2,277M.

In this section we attempt to calculate where numbers could end up for FTNT's revenues and billings. We will calculate product revenues and service revenues separately and then try and extrapolate billings from the calculated revenues and from the typical billings mix by quarter.

Our checks have indicated consistent momentum vs. Q3'25 but we were also told that the company was invoicing until the end of the quarter. If we look at the seasonality of FTNT's Q4 Product revenues in the last five years, it ranges from +4.8% q/q to +28.9% q/q. However, if we exclude the outliers and better seasonality during the pandemic years, typical q/q growth for Q4 is ~16%. In FY24, Q4 product revenues grew ~21% q/q but the q/q comps are slightly tougher. Hence, it would not be unreasonable to expect ~17% - 18% q/q growth in Product revenues for Q4'25. This gets us to ~$655M - $660M.

To calculate Service revenues, we assume that the Service Revenue momentum will continue to slow since Service Billings have continued to slow for the past few quarters. Service revenues grew ~12.7% y/y last quarter and hence we should expect the y/y growth for Service revenues in FQ4'26 to be lower, and it would not be unreasonable to expect ~12% - 12.3% y/y. This also implies q/q growth of ~4.2% - 4.7%, lower than the q/q growth of ~5% in Q4'24 and this appears reasonable too. This brings us to Service revenues of ~$1,215M - $1,220M. Combining the estimates we have calculated above, we end up with Q4'25E total revenues of $1,870M - $1,880M (adding the ~ $1,215M - $1,220M of service revenues to $655M - $660M of Product revenues).

For Q4'25E billings, we calculate Service Billings for Q4'25E based on typical seasonality and quarterly mix and that gets us to ~ $1,635M. We add this to the $655M - $660M Product revenues we calculated above, and this gets us to Q4'25E billings of $2,290M - $2,295M (~14.5% y/y). Hence, based on the above calculations, buy-side expectations for revenues appear reasonable, in our view.

Figure 4 - FTNT Product Revenues Scenario Analysis

| Product Revenues (SM)   | 789   | 916   | 1255   | 1781   | 1927   | 1909   | 2187   | 2475   |

Source: Roth Capital, FTNT Earnings Presentation We likely had some M&A tailwind in Product revenues in 2025, and we will assume ~$50M and adjusting for that we get to ~$1,220M of 2025 'new' Product revenues. We will assume the same amount of 'new' Product revenues and that gets us to ~$2,475M (~13% y/y). This appears a bit aggressive especially due to the comps getting much tougher, but we need to remember that we should have a material inflection in the refresh installed base in 2026 given the material uptick in Product momentum in 2021.

For Service revenues, we will assume that they will continue to slow in 1H of 2026E before recovering in 2H of 2026E, and hence ~11.5% y/y growth in 2026 should not be an unreasonable assumption (against ~13% Service revenue growth in 2025). This gets us to 2026E Service revenues of ~$5,120M. The Street is currently modeling at ~5,171M and this appears to be at risk. Adding the Product revenues and Service revenues gets us to 2026E Revenues of ~$7,595M (~12% y/y). For Billings, we will assume that Service Billings momentum also slows down in 2026E since comps have gotten much tougher, and it would not be unreasonable to expect 2026E Service Billings to grow ~13.4% y/y after growing ~14.4% y/y in 2025. That gets us to ~$6,000M.

Combining the 2026E Product revenue with Service billings gets us to Total Billings in 2026E of ~$8,475M. Street expectations for 2026E Revenues and Billings are $7,501M and $8,208M, respectively, and hence FTNT should be able to guide above for these metrics. For Q1'26E revenues, we will try and calculate what the actual number could be based on the typical quarterly mix, which has been ~22.8% for the last few years. Applying this to the ~$7,595M we calculated for 2026E revenues gets us to FQ1'26E revenues of ~ $1,732M and the Street is currently at ~$1,721M, and we believe this presents a slight risk to the guide.

For 2026 operating margins, we believe that the impact of increased memory pricing could impact Gross Margins by ~2 points and hence instead of growing margins y/y, 2026 Operating margins might be flat or slightly down. It would not be stretch to assume 2025 Operating margins end up at ~36% and 2026 Operating margins might be ~35% - 36%. However, FTNT typically guides with a 'buffer' of ~1 - 1.5 points and hence the current Street expectations of ~34.3% could be at slight risk.

We maintain our Neutral rating and our $90 price target, based on 25x FY26E EV/FCF, which implies ~2.2x EV/FCF/g, in line with peer multiples in the Security space. We are modeling Fortinet's billings growing ~11% y/y in FY26. There are always risks that the target price for any security will not be realized. Factors that would cause the stock to deviate from our target price could come from sales and profits materially above or below forecasts, the relative success of other competitive products, and change in the threat landscape which could render Fortinet's products ineffective.
