RATING HOLD PRICE TARGET NA PRICE $85.99 52-WEEK RANGE $70.12 - $114.82

Fortinet reported a mixed quarter. On the positive front, Billings outperformed expectations and was slightly above the midpoint of guidance, with management raising the CY25 guidance range by $20 million at the midpoint. However, full-year Revenue guidance was narrowed to the same midpoint of $6.75 Billion with $21 Million of upside during 3QCY25 offset by a $20 Million shortfall versus Street in 4QCY25. We see lighter growth in Services Revenue as the primary culprit, which management attributed to the lag from last year's Product Revenue decline (where Product has an average service term of 29 months). Into next year, management cited several new innovations such as a new ASIC and FortiOS, but the largest takeaway is management's expectation for improved Services Revenue growth in 2HCY26, built on improving Product trends this year.

■ Billings. Fortinet's Billings grew 14.3% yr-yr to $1,808 Million and were approximately $4 Million ahead of the sell-side estimate. Despite these dynamics, Services were relatively lighter than expectations based on (1) weaker Product Revenue growth in CY24, which carry an average 29month Service term; and (2) customers buying Hardware ahead of deployments next year. Within Billings, SASE grew 19% yr-yr (from 21% last quarter) while SecOps grew 33% yr-yr (from 31% last quarter). On a combined basis, SASE and SecOps contributed 37% of Total Billings.

■ Revenue. The company reported $1,725 Million in Revenue during 3QCY25, ahead of the consensus estimate for $1,704 Million. Product Revenue healthily outperformed expectations with $559 Million outpacing expectations for $531 Million. Meanwhile, Service Revenue of $1,166 Million lagged the consensus estimate of $1,173 Million. We see stronger trends from Product offset by lower growth in Services as explaining the reiterated (though narrower) CY25 Total Revenue guidance range. Management provided directional commentary for CY26, where the company anticipates improved Services Revenue growth in 2HCY26, following stronger recent performance from Product Revenues and allowing for the ~29-month Service term to renew.

■ SASE. Fortinet's FortiSASE is the company's fastest-growing solution at scale, where FortiSASE delivered more than 100% yr-yr Billings growth. Management believes FortiSASE continues to benefit from (1) tightly integrated functions across Next-Gen Firewall, SD-WAN, and SASE functionality; and (2) the seamless migration path from SD-WAN customers to deploy SASE within minutes. ■ $1 Million-Plus Deals. In the quarter, $1 Million Deal Count increased 26% yr-yr (compared to 29% last quarter), but the Deal Value was up a more modest 32% yr-yr (from 51% last quarter). We believe the lower $1 Million-plus Deal Value in 3QCY25 explains the weaker yr-yr growth for RPO and cRPO.

Fortinet is a widely recognized leader in Network Security with an expanding portfolio of FortiGate and Security Fabric products that can support durable long-term Revenue growth, and possesses the largest installed-base with more than 800,000 customers globally. While we view Fortinet's near-term targets as achievable, we only see modest upside to growth and think margins could see pressure as mix shifts to Product near-term and the company pushes into more competitive markets such as SASE and SecOps.

Fortinet is a multi-national Network Security company providing a range of products and services that protect people, devices, and data everywhere. The company's core product, FortiGate, includes firewall, Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDPS), Virtual Private Network (VPN), SD-WAN, Application Control, Vulnerability Management, Mobile Security, Secure Web Gateway (SWG) and more in a range of deployment models and form-factors.

■ Revenue and Billings CAGRs >12%. The Billings/Revenue targets were in-line to slightly above the consensus estimates for 11%-12% growth over the next two years. We note, CY25 Billings will benefit from easier compares, with CY24 growth +1.1% yr-yr at the midpoint of 3Q guidance. The Billings and Revenue growth targets compare to Fortinet's prior targets (CY22-CY25) for Billings/Revenue CAGRs of +22% to $10 Billion/$8 Billion, respectively. Management is confident in the new mid-term growth targets given the 26/27 refresh cohorts, the opportunity to cross-sell SASE and SecOps, and market share gains both domestically and internationally. ■ Total Gross Margins of 79%-80%.

■ Operating Margins >30%. Management noted operating margins exiting CY24 (33.5% at the midpoint of 4Q guidance) are likely on the higher-end of the near-term target range as they step up investments in quota-carrying reps and SASE/Cloud infrastructure. The operating margin guidance compared to our prior forecast for ~34% Operating Margins in CY25 and CY26. ■ Mid-to-High 30% Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margins. The guidance compares to the 37%/35% margins produced in CY22/CY23. Excluding real-estate add-backs, the guidance was at the lower end of consensus expectations and below higher buyside forecasts.

Click here for the full report. ■ Cloud Infrastructure Services. Akamai's CIS Revenue grew 30% yr-yr (29% constant currency) to $71 Million, contributing ~42% to the Cloud Computing segment in 2QCY25. Management anticipates CIS will accelerate yr-yr growth trends through the rest of CY25 due to large deals signed earlier this year. The CIS Revenue-stream has performed well in recent quarters, built off of the Compute and Storage solutions developed on the Linode acquisition, in addition to the EdgeWorkers product and ISV solutions. We believe CIS demand is driven by customers looking to bring compute closer to end-users for improved scalability and performance, while optimizing cost.

■ Security. The Security segment grew 11% yr-yr (10% constant currency) to $552 Million. Within Security, API Security and Zero Trust Enterprise Security scaled 48% yr-yr (49% constant currency) to $67 Million. Adjusting for the inorganic Revenue contribution of $8 Million from Noname Security, yr-yr Revenue growth was ~32%. Management expects the combined ARR from API Security and Zero Trust Enterprise Security to grow 30%-35% yr-yr constant currency in CY25. ■ AI. Akamai has also announced a few AI-related products, such as AI Gateway and Firewall for AI, though these remain early. AI Gateway allows customers to service end-users requests closer to the edge. Meanwhile, Firewall for AI fends off prompt abuse and model compromise. The AI product strategy centers on making AI faster, more secure, and more affordable.

Fortinet is currently benefiting from the EOS refresh cycle, where management estimates the company is ~40%-50% through the CY26 cohort (which is significantly larger than the CY27 cohort in terms of Revenue). Separately, while Product Revenue growth has trended better in recent quarters, the long lead-time (~29 month Service terms) means Service Revenue growth is unlikely to inflect higher until 2HCY26. With a lack of near-term catalysts, we remain Hold-rated.

Billings, Product Growth Surprise to Upside. If Fortinet's Billings growth troughs sooner than expected and product growth exceeds expectations it could drive upside to shares. Enterprise Growth Rebounds. Deal push-outs from Enterprise customers based on macro conditions could revert and prove guidance conservative. Additionally, Fortinet could have greater success than investors expect moving up market into large Enterprise. SD-WAN/OT Growth Remains Durable. Combined SD-WAN and OT make up over a quarter of Fortinet's business and the segments are growing well above corporate average. If these sub-markets remain stronger for longer, it could bolster results and drive shares higher. SASE Accelerates. Fortinet has discussed a robust SASE pipeline building as of late. If the company can execute on accelerated GTM and infrastructure investment in SASE, this could deliver upside to results.

Margins Continue to Expand. Fortinet has some of the strongest gross and operating margins in our coverage. If the company can continue to find ways to expand margins, shares could follow suit. Share Buybacks. Management has devoted a large amount of annual free cash flow to share repurchases. Fortinet Finds Success Moving Up-market. Fortinet has been messaging more aggressive moves up-market as the network security landscape shifts. If they are able to successfully penetrate larger enterprises and land larger deals the stock could be rewarded.

Weaker SMB and SME spend on Network Security and Hardware Form Factors. With just over half of FTNT's business coming from SMB/SME, the company is more subject to fluctuations in spend of these down-market customers than some of its competitors. Due to Fortinet's larger exposure to hardware form-factors relative competitors, the company is also more subject to refresh delays and spending cuts. Competition and Pricing Pressures. While Fortinet's foothold in core firewall remains strong, as the company expands into adjacent Security markets like SASE, XDR/SOC, and Cloud they will begin to compete against a cadre of formidable platform providers and point products. This could inhibit Fortinet's ability to produce growth outside firewall and limit upside. Margin Pressure from Investment Acceleration. Fortinet is a late-comer to the SASE market, and as such may need to accelerate investment in order to effectively compete in the market.

Exposure to and Reliance on Specific Verticals. In addition to being a sizable (10%-15%) component of FTNT's customer base, the company is also leaning heavily on communication service providers to facilitate growth of Fortinet's SASE product. If SP spending continues to weaken and their adoption of SASE slows, this would hurt Fortinet's business. Custom ASIC Advantage Potentially Fading as Cloud Growth Marches On . As workloads, users, and data shift to cloud, Fortinet's proprietary ASIC and price/performance advantages derived from the technology may become less relevant.
