CTSH posted a fine quarter, led by BFS, bookings and SG&A cost control. FY26 guide landed lighter vs buyside view, tho better demand backdrop exists, including discretionary thawing (BFSI-led) that implies guide conservatism. GM remains a sticking point (4Q miss from variable comp), tho AOM expansion supported by multiple levers. We revise ests, & PT to $85. Net, not a thesis-changing quarter.

Amid elevated Services & Software sector volatility, CTSH posted a steady 4Q & initial FY26 guides that project growth & operating momentum. Street ests move modestly higher (largely factoring increased M&A), and generally demand & pipeline commentary were positive with conservatism implied in FY26 outlook, but shares are not likely to see a meaningful change in sentiment amid the GenAI/agentic displacement fears for the group, and while aspects like pressured gross margin gives bears fodder as the trade-off for such a narrative. The immediate catalyst to change this is not clear as near-term Services fundamentals are OK, but valuation multiples have resumed free fall from terminal value concerns. We raise rev/EPS by 0.4%/0.7% and 0.6%/1.5% for FY26 & FY27, and PT to $85 (~13.7x CY27E P/E).

Stepping back, mixed aspects of the print were evident. It had strong BFSI growth (+9%) on both large deals & discretionary work, solid bookings (4Q +9%, 1.3x ttm B2B), and notable SG&A cost reduction. Though these were balanced by FY26 organic CC growth guide that was a touch light (3.75% at midpt vs. buyside at 4.0-4.5%), lower-than-expected GM and bookings ACV noted to have declined modestly. Growth builds over the year, which always leaves some skeptics, though large deal ramps and billing day dynamics explain it.

CTSH acknowledged the AI elephant in the room that's resurfaced to pressure the sector further this week, and we thought it did well in conveying a candid view, acknowledging the impacts of technology cycles, but also making a case for Services demand. It countered the spurt of negative sentiment that punished software & services stocks following the latest news flow on Anthropic Claude releases and PLTR comments on its AI-enabled offering completing ERP migrations in 'as little as two weeks', noting that no two implementations are the same, and that business outcomes do not simply 'switch on', as enterprises will continue to need Services vendors for complex reinventions, integrations, and context grounding.

CTSH takes the coexistence vs replacement view, noting that deterministic systems (like ERP/ systems of record) will need to coexist with new probabilistic software, which may in turn expand Services TAM by adding new and higher-value work on top of packaged apps/ERP. Importantly, CTSH already does this as a PLTR delivery partner (offering Neuro on top PLTR's Foundry and AIP), and CTSH's AI Builder Strategy includes developing new software layered on top of packaged platforms/apps. Net, management commentary was supportive of the view - which we share - that Services demand is likely to be more resilient than what's being priced into the market, and CTSH has already taken steps to capitalize on emerging services opportunities.

We rate CTSH shares Hold. Relatively low valuation is apt to provide downside support for shares, though some inconsistent financial performance and sectoral GenAI concerns have weighed on sentiment. A recent pickup in large deal momentum has supported more upbeat commentary. Sustaining the turnaround progress remains key. Balance sheet flexibility supports shareholder-friendly initiatives and bolt-on M&A, but we await firmer signals that would drive upside to estimates and/or multiple expansion.

■ 1Q26 results ■ Bolt-on M&A announcements ■ Capital returns execution

■ FY26 CC revenue growth below guide ■ Booking deteriorate ■ Operating margins deteriorate February 4, 2026

AOM of 16.0% (+30 bps y/y) beat expectations due to NextGen program savings, increased utilization, and FX benefits via INR depr. GM was weaker than anticipated at 33.7% (-140 bps y/y) and vs our 35.0% projection. CTSH largely attributed this to merit cycle increases and variable bonus comp (highest level since 2018), though the persistent pressure here remains a sticking point. Pricing commentary was consistent, with clients seeking greater throughput expectations, though this is not necessarily a drag on margins as CTSH executes on internal productivity and cost controls. Additionally, CTSH has sought to increase its exposure to fixed-price/transaction-based models (~50% of revenue vs 41-42% 3 yrs ago) in order to share productivity gains with clients (while taking on more risk). Although this still indicates some degree of margin risk moving forward, the FY26 AOM guide of 10-30 bps expansion is achievable as CTSH has a number of

levers to pull in the interim (AI efficiencies, utilization, offshore/onshore dynamics, pyramid optimization/mix) and structural FX tailwinds remain. India Labor Code changes did not have a material PnL / Margin impact as it flowed through AOCI.

■ Financial Services Strength (+9% y/y CC) driven by NA performance with continued large deal momentum (including one mega-deal in 4Q leveraging CTSH IP that will ramp from 2Q26) and better discretionary demand. FY26 momentum is supported by more of the same here with large deal ramps, a strong pipeline and discretionary activity persisting. ■ Health Sciences Industry cost pressures and policy changes driving heightened uncertainty with demand focused on cost reduction/productivity which is funding forward-looking initiatives across core platforms, cloud modernization, and regulatory readiness. GenAI is growing in areas like claims efficiency, clinical documentation, and CX. Healthcare also won a megadeal ($500M+) in 4Q. Looking ahead the volatility is expected to remain, though moderate growth remains the assumption (we model 4%+).

■ P&R P&R was essentially flat CC y/y due to continued tariff uncertainty suppressing discretionary spend and ER&D markets remaining weak. CTSH expects better growth in 2026 on the back of 2H25 deal wins. Expect LSD growth here in FY26. ■ CMT 4Q contraction of -1.2% y/y CC driven by weakness in Comms & Media, partly offset by growth in Tech. Comms/Media sees broader end market softness, particularly in NA, while Tech clients continue to adopt and scale GenAI. ■ Growth was led by North America (+4.2% y/y CC) via Fin Svcs and Health Sciences. Europe (+2.0% y/y CC) was driven by Fin Svcs and Life Sciences. Middle East turning to growth, which supported RoW growth (+3.6% y/y CC).

■ BPM/Intelligent Ops grew +9% y/y in 4Q, its strongest service line. Digital Engineering grew +8% y/y in 4Q, driven by CTSH IP like Flowsource and Neuro. Data and Cloud Modernization healthy with revenues growing MSD y/y organically in 4Q. ■ Bookings - Large deal TCV rose 60% y/y and there were 2 mega-deals across BFS & Health Sciences, and signs of incremental improvements in BFS discretionary indicate are evident.

FY26 capital returns expected to be ~$1.6B for the year, consisting of its regular dividend and ~ $1B in buybacks. Roughly 50 bps of the FY26 inorganic guidance is not yet announced, which suggests one or multiple deals are potentially in the works (w/ the M&A pipeline healthy). An additional 50 bps of inorganic growth for FY26 implies an additional ~$100M in inorganic revenue (reminder 3Cloud was taken out at ~3.5x revenues of ~$220M, which indicates $300M+ of further M&A outlay is likely). CTSH has ~$1B in cash available for M&A, though should no deal pan out, it's apt to lean into share repo further and support EPS.

NASDAQ: CTSH ESG Score: 55/100 ESG Industry Percentile: 22 nd

Establishing materiality is critical to evaluating a company's ESG performance. Factors most material in one sector (or to a particular company) may not be as important to another. In addition, the factors that are material - and the degree to which factors are material - can change over time. Applying data to frameworks established by SASB (the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and by FactSet, we present in the chart above the three most material ESG factors that investors should focus on for the company that is the subject of this report; the Dynamic Materiality™ of each factor (i.e., what percentage of overall materiality the category represents for the subject company); and a Score for the subject company in each of these three categories (on a 0 to 100 basis, with 50 being average). We also calculate an overall ESG Score for the subject company, which is presented above (in green) and on the cover of this report. A full explanation of how this ESG Score is derived is presented below.

200,000+ SOURCES 4,500,000+ DATA POINTS 300,000 SIGNALS SCREENED BY ESG FRAMEWORK 0-100 SCORE CALCULATED processed per month generated monthly TD Cowen leverages technology from FactSet to generate our ESG scores. Truvalue uses artificial intelligence to capture the stakeholder view of how companies are performing on ESG metrics, using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) materiality framework (www.sasb.org). These data are leveraged to calculate a score for each company, which allows TD Cowen to have a common framework and uniform way to approach ESG discussions with our clients. TD Cowen ESG scores appear on Company and Company Quick Take notes and are updated daily.

The process begins with capturing unstructured data from more than 200,000 sources, in 38 languages. These data are culled from a wide range of sources with varied perspectives, including industry publications, news outlets, NGOs, trade unions, government sources, legal and regulatory filings, and academic publications. Natural language processing is used to interpret semantic content from the original sources and generate analytics by applying criteria consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks. Performance is scored on a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate more positive ESG performance, and scores below reflect more negative ESG performance. A score of NA means not enough data is available on the company to generate a score.

| Employee Engagement             | 36%                      |      57 |

We use forward P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples to value the companies in the Computer Services industry. We support our valuation with cash per share analysis. We make investment recommendations on certain early stage, pre-revenue companies based upon an assessment of their business model, technology, probability of market success, and the potential market opportunity, balanced by an assessment of applicable risks. Such companies may not be assigned a price target.

The IT Services industry is sensitive to global economic growth. During a downturn or a recession, clients tend to reduce discretionary spending, which would have a direct negative impact on revenue growth at global and offshore IT Services vendors.

If wage costs increase at a faster rate than billing rates, IT Services vendors will experience a negative effect on margins and profitability. In addition, if wage costs will increase at a faster rate than the historical average, the vendors' services could become less attractive for N.A. and European clients, which will impact efficiency, utilization and profitability. In addition, the issuance of stock based compensation for IT professionals could result in dilution to shareholders.

While the companies' consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, a portion of the revenues (varies by company) is generated in other currencies (euros, INR, British pounds, etc.). In addition, in most cases, costs are not incurred in U.S. dollars. For example, the offshore vendors incur most of their costs in INR. This creates a currency and hedging risk.

Upside risks include: ■ Top line outperformance, particularly driven by the FS and/or Healthcare sector verticals ■ Faster margin expansion due to favorable revenue mix and cost control discipline ■ Normalization of attrition levels faster than anticipated

■ Macroeconomic slowdown and its impact on consulting markets ■ High level of industry competition ■ Human capital and the inability to maintain adequate capabilities
