Cognizant

EQUITY: SOFTWARE & SERVICES

Firmly establishing itself in the winner's circle; retain Buy and as one of our top picks in the lndia IT space

Cognizant's 4Q revenue at USD5,333mn was up 3.8% y-y in constant currency (cc), ahead of its guided band of 2.5-3.5% y-y growth (entirely organic; Fig. 1 ). Among major geographies, revenue growth was driven by North America, with +4.2% y-y growth (in cc). Financial services grew the fastest amongst verticals at +9.3% y-y (in cc). Adjusted EBIT margin at 16% (+30bp y-y) was ahead of our estimate of 15.7%. Adjusted diluted EPS at USD1.34 was up ~22% y-y. FY25 growth at 6.4% y-y in cc terms also surpassed guidance of 6-6.3% and had ~260bp inorganic component.

CTSH has guided for 4-6.5% y-y growth in cc for FY26E. This includes ~150bp inorganic contribution. At the mid-point, the organic growth guidance is stable at ~3.8% y-y, which we think reflects offsetting of strong execution by macro uncertainties. Trailing 12M bookings at USD28.4bn was up 5% y-y, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. CTSH noted that although the macroeconomic environment remains a bit challenging, cost pressures are driving the demand for optimization, vendor consolidation and productivity-led deals. Discretionary demand has rose in financial services but remains constrained in tariff-impacted sectors of products. Recall, in 3Q25 earnings

call, CTSH had articulated its AI builder strategy anchored on three vectors. Vector 1 is AI-led productivity funding transformation. Vector 2 is moving AI from experimentation to enterprise grade systems and Vector 3 is agentifying the enterprise which will unlock exponential agentic capital and raise addressable opportunity for service providers. It has ~4k live assignments running across clients. CTSH expects AI to be a catalyst for return of discretionary spending, triggering a CapEx cycle in enterprises to realize value, though macro support is still needed for acceleration.

4QFY25 adjusted EBIT margin at 16% was up 30bp y-y (flat q-q) aided by savings from the NextGen program and rupee's depreciation. Utilization at 83% was down 200bp q-q and up 100bp y-y. Headcount increased ~0.5% q-q to ~352k. CTSH noted that key drivers for margins will be AIled productivity, pyramid optimization through increased fresher hiring and expects 10-30bp y-y improvement in FY26E. We expect CTSH to deliver 15.9% EBIT margin over FY26-27F.

We cut FY26-27FF EPS by ~1-2% mainly on slightly higher tax rate (Fig. 12 ) . Our new FY26-27F EPS are higher than Bloomberg consensus by ~3-4%. We value CTSH at an unchanged 17x 1H FY27F EPS (methodology in this report ). Our new TP is USD100 (vs USD102 earlier).

Macro comments: Management mentioned that the macro environment remains complex, with traditional discretionary spending cycles evolving and some broader endmarket softness, especially in North America. CTSH noted that discretionary spending has shown a steady improvement in financial services over recent quarters, but tariff uncertainty continues to suppress it in the products and resources sector. Management also mentioned that AI adoption is increasing across consumer and retail sectors, driving the demand for data services and agentic experience transformation. Management believes that AI will act as a catalyst for discretionary spending to return, triggering a CapEx cycle in enterprises to realize value, though macro support is still needed for acceleration.

AI commentary: The company noted that it has over 4,000 AI engagements across three AI vectors, with over 30% of developer effort in software development cycles being AIassisted and agentic, contributing to improved productivity. Management noted that it is focused on solving the "AI velocity gap," which is the disparity between massive AI infrastructure spending and the realization of business value for clients, aiming to be the "AI builder" that bridges this gap. Cognizant's AI Builder stack addresses four layers: AI compute, cloud, model access, and human capital services, utilizing proprietary frameworks and a strong partnership ecosystem including NVIDIA, Anthropic, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, OpenAI, and Palantir.

Dividend and repurchases: For CY26E, the company expects to return approximately USD1.6bn to shareholders, with ~USD1bn allocated to share repurchases and the rest to regular dividends. Management stated that ample free cash flow is available for future M&As, but in the absence of strategic and accretive acquisition targets, capital will be returned to shareholders instead of accumulating cash on the balance sheet.
