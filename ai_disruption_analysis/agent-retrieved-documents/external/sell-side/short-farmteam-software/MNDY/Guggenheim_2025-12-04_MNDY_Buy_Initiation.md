Key Message: We're initiating coverage of Monday.com (MNDY) with a BUY rating and $250 price target, representing 64% upside potential. A leader in work management software with over 250K customers and 2.5M paying users, Monday.com has transitioned from a viral, self-serve strategy to a more sales-led, multi-product and

upmarket approach. Newer products (CRM, Dev, Service) are about 10% of ARR today and grew >80% y/y in 3Q25 (vs. Work Management +22%), contributing to reaccelerating New ARR / NNARR. Monday.com has also launched several AI features, including vibe coding (>60K apps built to-date) as the focus shifts to AI-enabled work execution and usagebased pricing. Despite being on a track to deliver 26%+ revenue growth and 27%+ FCF margin this year, making for a rare, balanced Rule of 50+ company, by our math, MNDY shares are pricing in zero growth and declining FCF into perpetuity in the terminal year. In our view, valuation already reflects a worst-case scenario of AI-driven productivity inducing seat count decline. This is far from reality. By our analysis, seat growth has stabilized at >15% in 1Q25-3Q25 vs. 22% in FY24,

driven by strong momentum in large customer (>$50K ARR) seat growth, while FY26/FY27 consensus estimates are achievable with modest seat growth deceleration, lesser pricing/cross-sell, and no AI contribution. This translates to modest New ARR growth, to which we see material upside, while customer/partner checks indicate high expansion propensity, supporting 20%+ growth potential for many years.

Stabilizing Seat Growth. Per our analysis using Monday.com's disclosures of customer metrics, ARR mix and an assumed ASP, we estimate that seat growth has stabilized at over 15% YTD in 1Q25-3Q25 (vs. 22% in FY24 and 31% in FY23), including 35%+ seat growth in the >$50K ARR cohort, reflective of upmarket and cross-sell success. We calculate that FY26 and FY27 consensus revenue estimates are achievable with modestly decelerating net dollar retention (NDR) vs. 111% in 3Q25, comprised of decelerating seat growth (13-14%) and 6-7 percentage point pricing/cross-sell contribution vs. about 10% in 2024-2025. We view this as reasonable, supported by positive field checks.

Check Indicate Promising Cross-Sell Opportunity. Our customer/partner checks indicate willingness to expand on Monday.com including: 1) 10% average annual seat expansion in work management; 2) cross-sell of CRM, Service, or Dev-4/5 customers are exploring these products; and 3) 2-3% annual price increases. CRM is most suitable for customers with simpler sales processes given scalability limits. Feedback for Dev is positive with promising growth prospects outside of Jira. Partners say Service is the fastest growing product. Customers are pleased with the new AI capabilities, especially AI Blocks and Vibe, even if monetization is early.

FY26 Consensus and FY27 Revenue Target Do Not Appear At Risk. We believe Monday.com will outperform both FY26 consensus revenue of $1.491B (+21.5% y/y) and its FY27 revenue target of $1.8B (21% CAGR vs. current FY25 consensus) by a comfortable margin. This is supported by our top-down New ARR build, bottom-up NNARR by product build, and incremental revenue analysis. In our plausible revenue scenario, we see Monday.com ultimately growing 24% y/y in FY26, driven by New ARR growth of 12% (vs. +12% in FY25E and reaccelerating trends YTD through 3Q25), and implying $292M of incremental revenue (+12%). We see FY27 revenue ultimately being $1.846B (+21% vs. our FY26E), or 3% above consensus , achievable with about 10% New ARR growth.

Valuation and Risks: Our $250 PT is based on a DCF analysis (see Exhibit 50) and implies 8.0x EV/NTM Recurring Revenue and 26.1x EV/NTM FCF, vs. 4.4x and 15.5x currently, well below the average of 8 Software peers with lower growth and FCF margin. MNDY shares are the least expensive on a growth-adjusted basis (2.0x vs. 3.6x peer average). Risks include: 1) AI-driven productivity hurts seat growth, 2) cross-sell momentum declines, 3) AI risk to performance marketing.

Key Message: We're initiating coverage of Monday.com (MNDY) with a BUY rating and $250 price target, representing 64% upside potential. A leader in work management software with over 250K customers and 2.5M paying users, Monday.com has transitioned from a viral, self-serve strategy to a more sales-led, multi-product and upmarket approach. Its newer products (CRM, Dev, Service) are about 10% of ARR today and grew >80% y/y in 3Q25 (vs. Work Management +22%), contributing to reaccelerating New ARR / NNARR. Meanwhile, Monday.com has launched several AI features, including vibe coding (>60K apps built to-date) as it evolves from work management to AI-enabled work execution and begins incorporating usage-based pricing. Despite being on a track to deliver 26%+ revenue growth and 27%+ FCF margin this year, making for a

rare, balanced Rule of 50+ company, there is a disconnect with MNDY shares, which by our math, are pricing in zero growth and declining FCF into perpetuity in the terminal year. In our view, current valuation already reflects a worst-case scenario of AI-driven productivity inducing seat count decline. This is far from reality. By our analysis, seat growth has stabilized at >15% YTD in FY25, driven by strong momentum in large customer (>$50K ARR) seat growth, while FY26 consensus revenue and the company's FY27 target of $1.8B are achievable with modest deceleration in both seat growth and pricing/cross-sell, and no AI contribution. This translates to only modest New ARR growth, to which we see material upside, while our customer/partner checks suggest high propensity to expand on Monday.com, supporting 20%+ growth potential over many years. As the least expensive name in our coverage on a growth adjusted basis,

Monday.com's risk/reward skews quite favorably, in our view. Stabilizing Seat Count Growth. According to our analysis using Monday.com's disclosures of customer metrics, ARR mix and an assumed ASP, we estimate that seat growth has stabilized at over 15% YTD in 1Q25-3Q25 (vs. 22% in FY24 and 31% in FY23), including 35%+ seat growth in the >$50K ARR cohort, reflective of upmarket and cross-sell success. We calculate that FY26 and FY27 consensus revenue estimates are achievable with modestly decelerating net dollar retention (NDR) vs. 111% in 3Q25, comprised of decelerating seat growth (13-14%) and 67 percentage point pricing/cross-sell contribution vs. about 10% in 2024-2025. We view this as reasonable, supported by positive customer/partner checks.

Checks Indicate Promising Cross-Sell Opportunity. Our conversations with five Monday.com enterprise customers and two large channel partners, indicate broad willingness to expand on Monday.com including: 1) about 10% average annual seat expansion in work management (range of 7-15% growth) driven by headcount growth, new project work, and department rollouts; 2) planned consolidation onto Monday.com for CRM, Service, or Dev-four of five customers are actively exploring these products; and 3) modest annual price increases (about 2-3%). For work management, customers noted plans to move seats from competitors like Asana, Smartsheet, a slew of similar vendors, and even Jira (Atlassian). CRM is most suitable for customers with simpler sales processes

given scalability limits, which should be significantly mitigated with the impending launch of MondayDB 3.1. Feedback to Dev is positive with promising growth prospects outside of displacing Jira, which is deeply entrenched in engineering teams. Partners say Service is the fastest growing product for Monday.com. Customers are pleased with Monday.com's AI capabilities, especially AI Blocks and Vibe, even if monetization remains a question.

FY26 Consensus and FY27 Revenue Targets Do Not Appear at Risk. We believe Monday.com will outperform both FY26 consensus revenue of $1.491B (+21.5% y/y vs. FY25 consensus) and its FY27 revenue target of $1.8B (21% CAGR vs. current FY25 consensus) by a comfortable margin. This is supported by our top-down New ARR build, bottom-up NNARR by product build, and incremental revenue analysis. Current FY26 consensus looks achievable with New ARR down 2% y/y vs. +12% in FY25E, or NNARR down 12% vs. +6% in FY25E, and implying incremental revenue of $256M (down 2% y/y). In our plausible revenue scenario, we see Monday.com ultimately growing 24% y/y in FY26, driven by New ARR growth of 12% (vs. +12% in FY25E and reaccelerating trends YTD through 3Q25). This implies NNARR +11% (+8% in Work Management

and +20% in New Products) and $292M of incremental revenue (+12%). Additionally, we see FY27 revenue ultimately being $1.846B (+21% vs. our plausible FY26 estimate), or 3% above consensus , achievable with about 10% New ARR and NNARR growth. Coupled with Adjusted FCF margin above 30%, this would make Monday.com a sustainable Rule of 50 company for the foreseeable future, in our view.

AI Risk to Seat Growth. The greatest risk to Monday.com is that as AI increases workforce productivity, then all else equal, there will be fewer humans needed to complete the same tasks, resulting in fewer Monday.com seats needed over time. If this risk were to manifest, it could lead to a precipitous decline in Monday.com revenue growth and eventually profit. Cross-Sell Momentum Declines. Monday.com's ability to achieve its FY27 revenue target of $1.8B is dependent on continued success cross selling its other products like CRM, Dev, and Service. In fact, we estimate that cross-sell will need to contribute more than 3-4 percentage points of growth each year if seat growth were to decelerate materially. Declining cross-sell contribution could lead to failure in achieving its FY27 revenue target.

Other AI Risks: Performance Marketing and Vibe Coding. Monday.com has historically been heavily dependent on performance marketing (e.g., paid search, email marketing) as a source of leads. As more people leverage GenAI chatbots like ChatGPT for product recommendations, this could negatively impact the effectiveness of investments in performance marketing. Monday.com has said that although this risk is manifesting, Google paid search represents less than 10% of New ARR today, and it is starting to reallocate S&M investments into other channels. Separately, there is the risk that non-technical knowledge workers build their own work management solutions using no code AI development tools (e.g., Lovable, Replit). We assign a very low probability to this risk manifesting, based on our channel checks indicating this is not happening.

Valuation. Our $250 PT is based on a 3-stage DCF analysis and implies 8.0x EV/NTM Recurring Revenue (6.3x FY27E) and 28.3x EV/NTM FCF (21.9x FY27E), vs. current multiples of 4.4x NTM Recurring Revenue (3.5x FY27E) and 15.5x NTM FCF (12.0x FY27E). MNDY trades significantly below the average NTM multiples (based on consensus estimates) of 6.0x and 25.7x, respectively, for the average of eight Software peers that have lower revenue growth and FCF margin (FY26E revenue growth of 16% vs. MNDY's 21% and FY26E FCF margin of 22% vs. MNDY's 27%). In fact, MNDY shares are the least expensive on a growth-adjusted basis (2.0x vs. 3.6x peer average). Even if we assume

0% revenue and FCF growth in the terminal year, the DCF-implied price target is still about 20% higher than the current price. See Exhibit 45.

Recent Price Performance. As of December 3, 2025, MNDY shares are down 35% YTD, significantly underperforming the IGV Software Sector ETF (+7%) and S&P 500 (+15%). In our view, the underperformance this year was due to two consecutive quarters where MNDY's revenue upside was smaller than in the past and only maintained full-year guidance (2Q25 earnings on August 11 th after which shares were down 30% and 3Q25 earnings on November 10 th after which shares were down 13% [vs. S&P 500 +4% and flat, respectively]). The AI search engine threat to paid search and broader AI risk to seat growth remain overhangs on the stock. This follows two years (2023 and 2024) when MNDY shares performed about in line with the IGV, and 2022 when MNDY significantly underperformed the IGV and S&P 500. In the first year of its IPO (June 10, 2021), MNDY significantly outperformed the IGV and S&P 500. See Exhibit 1.

Monday.com offers a suite of work collaboration software products, including work management, customer relationship management (CRM), software development (Dev), and service management (Service). Its cloud-based 'Work OS' (Operating System) is a no-code and low-code framework that consists of modular building blocks that are simple enough for anyone to use and integrates with other systems and applications. Monday.com's platform and products help organizations simplify and accelerate their digital transformation, enhance organizational agility, create a unifying workspace across departments, and increase operational

efficiency and productivity. Monday.com's work management product is used by more than 2.5M users across 250,000 companies, as of June 30, 2025. Co-founders Roy Mann and Eran Zinman are both currently Co-CEOs, with Mr. Mann serving since 2012, and Mr. Zinman since 2020. The company went public on June 10, 2021, listing on the Nasdaq exchange with an IPO valuation of approximately $6.9B. In FY24, Monday.com generated total revenue of $972M, a 33% increase y/y, and adjusted free cash flow of $296M (30% margin). Monday.com is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel and had 2,508 employees as of December 31, 2024.

Summary: AI risks for Monday.com take a few forms. The most important one is risk to seat growth as AI increases workforce productivity. According to our analysis using Monday.com's disclosures of customer metrics, ARR mix and an assumed ASP, we estimate that seat growth has stabilized at over 15% in 1Q253Q25 (vs. 22% in FY24 and 31% in FY23), including 35%+ seat growth among >$50K ARR customers, reflective of upmarket and cross-sell success. We calculate that FY26 and FY27 consensus revenue estimates are achievable with modestly decelerating net dollar retention (NDR) vs. 111% in 3Q25, comprised of decelerating seat growth (13-14%) and 6-7 percentage point pricing/cross-sell contribution. We view this as reasonable, supported by our

customer/partner checks (see Key Debate #3), with potential upside driven by increasing enterprise traction. We discuss the other two AI risks later in this section.

AI Risk to Seat Growth. If AI lives up to its promise and increases workforce productivity, then all else equal, it should result in fewer humans needed to complete the same tasks. For example, Monday.com is proof of this itself, given its plans to reduce headcount growth from 35% in FY24 to 30% in FY25 to 20% in FY26 and potentially further in FY27 and beyond, driven partly by expected AI efficiencies. If other companies both large and small also slow headcount growth, or even worse, reduce headcount en masse (recent headlines of Global 2000 company layoffs exacerbate this concern), is this impending doom for Monday.com's seat expansion potential?

Potential Market Share Gains; More Work Collaboration With AI. On the other hand, Monday.com's revenue at over $1.2B this year and $2B in a few years, by our estimates, would still be only a fraction of its TAM, which we estimate at over $70B and the company estimates at over $150B (we'll the split the difference and call it $100B growing at a low teens CAGR). As a leader in work management

software, Monday.com has significant opportunity for further share gains even if global headcount for work management software were to contract. There's also the argument that AI efficiency begets more projects and more intercompany collaboration, resulting in the need for more Monday.com seats. We believe the key question is can Monday.com still maintain 20% revenue growth for the next few years even with slowing seat count growth? We argue yes.

Seat Growth YTD 2025 Stabilizing at >15% Y/Y. According to our analysis using Monday.com's disclosures of customer count, ARR mix, and estimated ASPs informed by our channel checks and management, we estimate that seat growth has stabilized at over 15% in 1Q25-3Q25, following several quarters of decline and average 22% growth in FY24 and 31% in FY23. Overall seat growth is being driven primarily by stable to accelerating seat growth (+36% YTD in FY25) in the >$50K ARR cohort that represents 40% of Total ARR and even more so in the >$100K ARR cohort (+44% YTD) that is 27% of ARR (a subset of the >$50K ARR customers). We believe this reflects successful cross-sell and seat expansion among mid-market and larger enterprise customers, more than offsetting the seat growth among <$50K ARR customers that has slowed to high single

digits y/y. 15%+ overall seat growth is despite overall customer count slowing to the mid-single digit growth range, as the quality of customers is improving. Pricing/Cross-Sell About 10 %-Points of Revenue Growth. We estimate that price increases and cross-sell have contributed about 10 percentage points of growth in 2024 and 2025, including 3-4 percentage points from list price increases (per management), 3-4 percentage points from cross-sell of CRM, Dev, and Service, low single digits from premium add-ons, and about 1 percentage point from tier upgrades. We estimate that YTD through 3Q25, pricing/cross-sell has contributed about 11 points of growth to 27% ARR growth. See Exhibit 2 for a summary view of seat growth vs. pricing/cross-sell (including premium add-ons and tier upgrades) by customer segment.

 >$50K ARR Customers. According to reported ARR mix by cohort, ARR for >$50K ARR customers (40% of Total ARR as of 3Q25) has grown an average of 50% y/y over the last 8 quarters and 47% YTD in FY25. Assuming pricing/cross-sell contribution of about 10 percentage points (we estimate $627/seat/year as of 3Q25), that implies seat growth of 40% over the last 8 quarters and 36% YTD as of 3Q25.  >$100K ARR Customers. Within this cohort, ARR from >$100K ARR customers (27% of Total ARR as of 3Q25) has grown 59% y/y over the last 8 quarters and 55% YTD in FY25. We estimate seat growth has been about 45% over the last 8 quarters, and 44% YTD as of 3Q25.

 Customers with 10+ Users, <$50K ARR. We estimate that for customers with a least 10 users but under the $50K ARR threshold (41%

of Total ARR as of 3Q25), seat growth has been about 16% over the last 8 quarters and has decelerated to 8% YTD as of 3Q25.  Customers with <10 Users. We estimate that for customers with less than 10 users (the smallest mix of Total ARR at 19% as of 3Q25), seat growth has been about 11% over the last 8 quarters and has decelerated to 7% YTD as of 3Q25.

FY26/FY27 Guidance Achievable, Aided By >$50K ARR Customers. By our math, FY26 consensus and FY27 consensus (which is slightly below the $1.8B target recently issued by management) revenue estimates are achievable with overall NDR decelerating modestly to 110% vs. 111% in 3Q25 and essentially no growth in new logo ARR. This is achievable with overall seat growth decelerating modestly to 14-15% y/y and 6-7 percentage points of growth contribution from pricing/cross-sell vs. about 10 points in 2024-2025. We see potential upside to both seat growth and cross-sell, driven by continued outsized growth in the >$50K and >$100K ARR cohorts as Monday.com continues to gain more enterprise success.

Sustainable Mid-Teens Seat Growth and Mid-Single Digit Pricing/Cross-Sell Growth. We estimate that over the next 5 years (through 2030), seat count growth in the >$50K ARR cohort can sustain an average y/y growth rate of 23%, while pricing, cross-sell (including premium add-ons), and tier upgrades can sustain mid to high single digits percent growth over the same period. Within the >$100K ARR cohort, we believe that average y/y seat count growth of approximately 30% and similar mid to high single digit percent pricing/cross-sell growth are sustainable.

Summary: Secondary to the AI risk to seat growth, Monday.com has risk of AI search replacing paid search (primarily Google AdWords) and potentially other forms of traditional performance marketing. Performance marketing represents only one-third of S&M today for Monday.com vs. 60% four years ago (see Exhibit 3), with Google AdWords representing less than 10% of New ARR, per management. Monday.com is mitigating this risk with a targeted outbound, multiproduct and upmarket sales strategy, while also starting to get leads from GenAI (e.g., ChatGPT). We believe this is manifesting in sales efficiency (New ARR / LTM non-GAAP S&M expense) ticking back up for three consecutive quarters; however, it's still below 1.0x, leaving significant room for improvement. Exhibit 3: Monday.com Performance Marketing Spend % of S&M Expense Source: Monday.com FY25 Investor Day Presentation

Monday.com has historically relied heavily on performance marketing (e.g., paid search, email marketing, paid social/video) to generate leads for its primarily selfserve and inbound sales model. Within this, the effectiveness of Google paid search (AdWords), which represents less than 10% of New ARR, according to management, has come under pressure due to new GenAI search channels. The risk is that AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Anthropic Claude, as well as Google's Gemini and Google AI Overviews feature within Google Search, replace traditional paid search. To counteract lower ROI for Google AdWords, Monday.com has begun shifting investment dollars from Google into other online and social channels (e.g., YouTube, Facebook). The company is also investing more in sales-led channels, including bolstering its outbound sales force and executing on a targeted upmarket cross-sell strategy. Meanwhile, Monday.com is starting to get leads from ChatGPT and other GenAI-led sources.

AI Search Tiny Today but Growing Fast. According to Similarweb, referral from other websites represents about 4% of Monday.com's total inbound website traffic vs. about 12% from organic search, 7% from paid search, and about three-

quarters from direct-to-website views. See Exhibit 4. Visitors from AI chatbots/search engines like ChatGPT are categorized within referrals and have been significantly outpacing the growth of traditional search (both organic and paid). Specifically, ChatGPT represents well under 1% of Monday.com's inbound website traffic today. As AI models evolve, they will likely capture some of the paid search revenue, even if it's in a different form, and become a bigger part of marketing budgets. So while still tiny today, it is an area that Monday.com is keenly focused on. According to management, by leveraging its proprietary BigBrain business intelligence tool that tracks and predicts value associated with different marketing campaigns, Monday.com is working to monitor and optimize GenAI to drive more traffic to its website.

Targeted Cross-Sell and Upmarket Strategy. At the company's FY25 Investor Day in September 2025, new CRO Casey George outlined plans to increase expansion within existing accounts and accelerate new logos adds, via a threepronged strategy that we summarize below. Refer to Exhibit 5.

1) Multi-Product Strategy: Today, only 6% of Monday.com accounts use more than one product, and among them, there is an average 2.5x ACV uplift vs. work management-only accounts. The introduction of new products has been a primary driver of average ACV increasing over 5x from $0.9K per customer in FY17 to $4.9K in FY25. Per Mr. George, Monday.com is exploring different product bundles for specific customer use cases (e.g., Service Management for both asset management and ITSM). The company has identified approximately 40% of its Work Management customers today as potential cross-sell candidates. 2) Targeted Cross-Sell Upmarket: Monday.com will continue to target all customer sizes for Work Management. For other products, it will aggressively pursue the SMB and mid-market enterprise markets while carefully targeting large enterprise customers that typically already use several incumbent software vendors. Mr. George is overlaying sales specialists (125 expected in FY26 vs. 60 in FY25 and 33 in FY24) to better cross-sell upmarket.

3) Customer Retention and Leads: Mr. George described an opportunity to clean up ownership of accounts, with clearly articulated account managers and customer success reps, to better educate customers about what Monday.com has to offer. He has also changed sales compensation to be 75% weighted to variable comp for new logos / 25% to retention for sales managers/account executives, and the opposite for customer success teams. o Selling with AI . Mr. George also gave an example of using an AI agent built using Monday.com to qualify sales opportunities from inbound marketing leads, identify the resources required to service the opportunity, automatically schedule meetings, and record all actions within Monday CRM. Exhibit 5: Monday.com's Maturing GTM Strategy Source: Monday.com FY25 Investor Day presentation

In our view, Monday.com's sales efficiency, which we calculate as in-period New ARR divided by average non-GAAP S&M expense over the last four quarters, has been increasing over the last few quarters, after several quarters of volatility and a trough in 4Q24. Sales efficiency is still below that in prior years (0.90 YTD through 3Q25 vs. average of 0.98 from 1Q22-4Q24), and still below 1.0x, which leaves significant room for improvement. See Exhibit 6. However, we believe as S&M dollars get invested in higher ROI performance marketing channels and enterprise sales efforts vs. Google paid ads that have had impaired ROI, this ratio should get better. Additionally, we believe that Monday.com is rightsizing the commissions it pays to channel partners, which we believe has been materially above industry standards.

Summary: The most extreme but least likely form of AI risk for Monday.com is that by using no code/low code AI development tools like Lovable or Replit, nontechnical business users can create their own lightweight work management applications, bypassing the need for Monday.com. Alternatively, CIOs could task software engineers to build more advanced, direct replacements for Monday.com using AI coding tools like Cursor or Anthropic's Claude Code. In our field checks and conversations with CIOs, there is no indication that internally building work management solutions is even on the roadmap. The project and workflow logic built into Monday.com, in addition to scalability and security features, are hard to replace. Rather, the opposite is happening-Monday.com users are creating new apps within the platform (via Monday Vibe) and leveraging its other AI tools (AI Blocks, Sidekick), which Monday.com is starting to monetize. Monday.com is embracing GenAI capabilities to not only defend against the vibe coding risk but is transforming its platform from a place for work management to

one focused on AI-assisted work execution.

So far, over 50% of customer accounts are leveraging Monday.com's AI features, and the usage stats are promising. Monday.com is also starting to monetize on some of the features, while management is careful to not pull this lever too quickly. Currently, Vibe and AI Blocks seem to be the most value-add AI features with the greatest potential for material contribution to revenue , followed by Sidekick (which is a copilot that's not really being monetized yet). Agent Factory (part of broader Agents capabilities to roll out in 1H26) is brand new, while Campaigns (which is not technically an AI product, but is usage-based and a

marketing automation add-on to CRM) is also too new to gauge initial success. See more details on AI feature descriptions, AI pricing, and customer/partner feedback on AI features. See Exhibit 7.  Monday Vibe-High Value to Price. Vibe allows Monday.com users to build custom apps via a natural language chat box that are fully integrated with existing workflows, permissions, and team context. As of September 30, there were over 60,000 apps created using Vibe. This includes both draft and published apps and many that were created before general availability in mid-July. Monday.com started to monetize the production Vibe apps starting in mid-October at $10/app/month. We believe production apps represent only a fraction of the 60,000, but management is pleased with monetization so far.

 AI Blocks-Expect Monetization to Start Post Credits Change. As of mid-September, there were already 67M+ actions executed within Monday.com using the new AI Blocks features. (e.g., information extraction, summarization, sentiment analysis, etc.). A pricing change made in 4Q25 limits free credits to a one-time amount (1,500 for the Enterprise tier and 750 for other tiers), although credits are worth more now (charged per item rather than action). We view this pricing change as a slight positive, which could result in a modest near-term revenue benefit as more customers jump into the paying bucket faster than before.

Summary: Yes. We believe Monday.com will outperform both FY26 consensus revenue of $1.491B (+21.5% y/y vs. FY25 consensus) and its FY27 revenue target of $1.8B (21% CAGR vs. current FY25 consensus) by a comfortable margin. This is supported by our top-down New ARR build, bottom-up NNARR by product build, and incremental revenue analysis. Current FY26 consensus is achievable with New ARR down 2% y/y vs. +12% in FY25E, or NNARR down 12% vs. +6% in FY25E, and implies incremental revenue of $256M (down 2% y/y). In our plausible revenue scenario, we see Monday.com

ultimately growing 24% y/y in FY26, driven by New ARR growth of 12% (vs. +12% in FY25E and reaccelerating trends YTD through 3Q25). This implies NNARR +11% (+8% in Work Management and +20% in New Products) and $292M of incremental revenue (+12%). This leaves sufficient room for upside throughout the year, even if beats are smaller vs. the past (we believe this is the new norm). Additionally, we see FY27 revenue ultimately being $1.846B (+21% vs. our plausible FY26 estimate), or 3% above consensus , achievable with about 10% growth in both New ARR and NNARR. Coupled with Adjusted FCF margin of about 30%, this would make for a sustainable Rule of 50 company for the foreseeable future, in our view.

Monday.com exceeded 3Q25 results but the revenue beat was smaller vs. prior quarters, while full-year 2025 guidance was only maintained, implying 4Q25 consensus was lowered to below consensus estimates. Management attributed the shortfall primarily to the timing effect of investments. Specifically, the company reallocated dollars from Google AdWords to other online channels (e.g., social/video) and some sales-led channels (e.g., in-person events) that have longer sales cycles. Management has previously stated that Google AdWords represents less than 10% of New ARR. Management also expressed confidence in achieving its FY27 revenue target of $1.8B as these other sales channels mature, combined with more traction from cross-sell and gradual AI monetization.

Total revenue of $317M (+26%) was 1% above consensus of $313M (+25%), vs. an average beat of 2.1% in the last four quarters. We estimate New ARR (which factors in churn/starts with gross retention) grew +18% y/y vs. +16% in 3Q24 and accelerated as measured on a 2-year stack, while NNARR grew about 18% y/y, marking acceleration on a 2-year stack for the last several quarters. New Products (CRM, Service, and Dev) was 10.2% of Total ARR vs. 9.4% in 2Q25. We calculate Work Management NNARR grew 16% y/y while New Products NNARR grew 23% y/y, both accelerating vs. 2Q25. Net-Dollar Retention (TTM) remained stable at 111%. Management called our three deals signed in the quarter that were over $1M of ARR. All three started 3-4 years ago at around $50K ARR, and include a large European logistics company with 5,000 seats including

1,500 CRM seats, and a large tech company using Monday.com across 10 departments. Non-GAAP

operating income was $48M (15% margin) and was above consensus of $35M (11% margin). FY25 Non-GAAP operating income guidance was also raised to $167-169M (14% margin) from $154-158M (13% margin).

FY25 guidance was narrowed to $1.226-1.228B (+26%) from $1.224-1.229B (+26%), while 4Q25 total revenue guidance of $328-330M (+22-23%) was below consensus of $334M (+25%). By our math, guidance is achievable with 4Q25 New ARR declining 13% y/y vs. +13% in 4Q24, implying NNARR down about 37% y/y, and both decelerating significantly on a 2-year stack. By product, we calculate that guidance is achievable with Work Management NNARR down 50% y/y and New Products NNARR decelerating to about +16% vs. +20% in 3Q25. In our plausible scenario, we are modeling New ARR +16% / NNARR +15% (including Work Management NNARR growth of 14% and New Products NNARR +20%), resulting in total revenue of $335M (+25%), or about

2% above consensus of $330M. Full-year non-GAAP operating income guidance was raised by the $12M 3Q25 upside, although 4Q25 guidance of $36-38M (11% margin) was slightly below consensus of $40M (12% margin), which was above implied guidance. We see modest upside to operating income guidance.

At its FY25 Investor Day, Monday.com provided a FY27 revenue target of $1.8B, representing a 21% CAGR vs. FY25 guidance ($1.227B at the midpoint). CFO Eliran Glazer called this a baseline for growth, implying that management expects to eventually exceed this number. We believe that guidance embeds the following assumptions, based on our conversations with the company:

 Limited AI Monetization. The FY27 target is achievable with limited contribution from recently launched AI products such as AI Blocks, Vibe, Sidekick, and Agents (expected to be launched in 1H26).  At Least Stable NDR. Since 1Q24, NDR has fluctuated between 110112%, while in the two most recent quarters (2Q25/3Q25) it stabilized at 111%. Management expects NDR to remain at 111% into the remainder of FY25 and sees potential improvement over the medium-term. According to our plausible scenario, we believe this assumption is reasonable based on the implied seat growth and pricing/cross-sell contribution, while we believe guidance is achievable with modest deceleration in NDR.

 Customer Growth in the Mid-Single Digits. Guidance assumes customer growth slows down to mid-single digit growth vs. 9% growth in FY24 and 21% in FY23. As Monday.com begins to shift upmarket, management is placing an emphasis on landing higher quality customers rather than focusing on quantity, as these accounts will have a greater propensity to spend on Monday.com.

 Cross-Sell. If customer growth is not as strong, guidance is achievable by leaning more into cross-sell of new products (CRM, Campaigns, Dev, and Service). Currently, 6% of customers utilize more than one Monday.com product, and management believes that number can accelerate and grow closer to a max of 40% over time. We calculate cross-sell has contributed about 3-4 points of growth in each of 2024 and 2025 and should become a bigger contributor over time as CRM, Service, and Dev grow as a percentage of overall revenue.  Pricing. Guidance embeds about 1-2% pricing increases each year, primarily due to gradually bringing discounted products to list price. This follows a one-time list price increase that contributed about 3-4 percentage points of growth in each of 2024 and 2025 and a modest benefit (less than 1 percentage point) expected in 2026.

 Premium Add-Ons. We believe that premium add-ons have contributed, and will continue to, to low single-digit percent of revenue growth. Premium add-ons include premium support, managed services, advanced security (Guardian), workflow builder, advanced automations and WorkCanvas.

FY26 Guidance Does Not Appear at Risk. Assuming our 4Q25 plausible scenario happens, we calculate current FY26 consensus total revenue of $1.491B (+21% vs. current FY25 consensus) is achievable with New ARR down about 2% y/y vs. +12% in FY25. On a NNARR basis, this implies $245M vs. an estimated $278M in FY25, or a 12% decline vs. 6% growth in FY25. In our plausible scenario, we are modeling 12% New ARR growth or 11% NNARR growth ($308M). This translates to FY26 revenue of $1.526B (24% revenue growth vs. our FY25 plausible), or more than 2% upside to current Street estimates. Therefore, we believe management can start initial FY26 guidance in line with current consensus. See Exhibit 8 for FY26 consensus-implied New ARR and NNARR and Exhibit 9 for our plausible scenario.

FY27 Revenue Target Achievable. In our plausible scenario that assumes New ARR growth of 10% in FY27 vs. 12% in FY26, we're modeling total revenue of $1.846B (+21% vs. our FY26 plausible scenario). This is 2.6% above the FY27 target of $1.8B and 3.0% above consensus ($1.792B), which is slightly below. On a NNARR basis, this implies $336M (+9% y/y) vs. an estimated $308M (+11%) in FY26 and $278M (+6%) in FY25. We believe this is reasonable, supported by steady new business momentum in both Work Management and cross-sell of New Products (we analyze this mix more in the next section). See Exhibit 9 for our plausible scenario.

Based on our incremental revenue analysis, we don't see risk to initial FY26 guidance starting below consensus or risk to the FY27 $1.8B revenue target. See Exhibit 10. FY25 Incremental Revenue. In FY24, Monday.com set initial guidance at $929M at the midpoint (+27% y/y), which implied incremental revenue of $199M vs. FY23, and ultimately ended up doing $242M of incremental revenue (+15% y/y), or about 22% ($43M) above their initial target. Monday.com started guidance in FY25 at $1,214.5B at the midpoint (+25%), implying an incremental $242M of revenue. In our plausible case, we are modeling $261M of incremental revenue exiting the year, which would be 8% ($19M) above the initial target.

FY26 Incremental Revenue. Assuming our FY25 plausible scenario plays out, FY26 consensus total revenue of $1.491B (+21% y/y) would imply $258M of incremental revenue compared to our estimated $261M in FY25, or down 1% y/y. Ultimately, we are modeling total revenue growth of $1.526B (+24%), or $293M of incremental revenue, or up 12% (vs. +8% in FY25 and +15% in in FY24). We believe this is achievable with modestly decelerating New ARR momentum. Therefore, we believe initial guidance could start near consensus with sufficient upside potential throughout the year.

FY27 Incremental Revenue. Following this logic, the FY27 $1.8B revenue target would imply $267M of incremental revenue vs. our plausible FY26 estimate (down 9% y/y). Meanwhile, our FY27 plausible revenue implies $320M (up 10% y/y). Therefore, we do not see risk to the achievement of the FY27 revenue target.

ARR by Product Mix Disclosure. At its FY25 Investor Day, Monday.com started to disclose ARR mix between Work Management and New Products (CRM, Dev, and Service). Using these disclosures, we can estimate Net New ARR by Product. Within New Products, we are separately modeling NNARR growth from CRM, Service, and Dev. Note that the recently launched Campaigns product is included in Monday.com's calculation for New Products, but it is too early for it to be a material contributor. Refer to Exhibit 11.

We calculate our plausible revenue growth in FY26 of 24% is achievable with Total ARR growth of 22% vs. 25% in FY25, comprised of Work Management ARR growth of 19% vs. 21% in FY25 and New Products Total ARR growth of 50% vs. 74% in FY25. This implies Total NNARR growth of 11% vs. +6% in FY25, including Work Management NNARR growth of 8% vs. +2% y/y in FY25, and New Products NNARR growth of 20% vs. 23% in FY25.

-  New Products NNARR Mix. The 20% NNARR growth for New Products implied in our FY26 plausible scenario consists of CRM NNARR growth stable at 7% vs. +6% in FY25, Dev NNARR +32% vs. +52% in FY25, and Service NNARR +69% vs. +174% in FY25. CRM has been and we believe will continue to be the biggest contributor to New Products. We view the modest implied growth rate as achievable. Meanwhile, we view

68% growth for Service as potentially even conservative, as management has said Service is growing faster than when CRM first started out. Finally, we have Dev NNARR moderating to about 30% growth on what are still small numbers, which also seems reasonable to us, even when considering the GTM challenges for this product (e.g., going up against a deeply entrenched Jira product by Atlassian).

Assuming our FY26 plausible scenario plays out, we calculate our plausible revenue growth in FY27 of 21% is achievable with Total ARR growth of 20% vs. 22% in FY25, comprised of Work Management ARR growth of 17% vs. 19% in FY25, and New Products Total ARR growth of about 40% vs. 50% in FY26. This implies Work Management NNARR growth of 7% vs. +8% y/y in FY26, and New Products NNARR growth of 15% vs. 20% in FY26. We view this as reasonable, while noting that FY26 overachievement (underachievement) would lower (raise) the bar for FY27.

Summary: Yes; according to five Monday.com enterprise customers and two large channel partners, there seems to be broad willingness to expand on Monday.com including: 1) about 10% average annual seat expansion in work management (range of 7-15% growth) driven by headcount growth, new project work, and department rollouts; 2) planned consolidation onto Monday.com for

CRM, Service, or Dev-four of five customers were actively exploring these products; and 3) modest annual price increases (about 2-3%). The customers generally view Monday.com work management as a leading enterprise-grade solution, with some planning to move seats from competitors like Asana, Smartsheet, a slew of similar vendors, and even Jira (Atlassian). CRM is most suitable for customers with simpler sales processes given scalability limits, which should be significantly mitigated with the impending launch of MondayDB 3.1. Feedback for Dev is positive with promising growth prospects outside of displacing Jira (Atlassian), which is deeply entrenched in engineer teams. Meanwhile, partners say Service is the fastest growing product for Monday.com, which they expect to continue as customers come to fully appreciate its broad capabilities. Customers and partners are also pleased with Monday.com's AI capabilities, especially AI Blocks and Vibe, even if monetization is still early. See Exhibit 12 for a summary of customer and partner checks.

Enterprise customers and channel partners consistently described Monday.com as all-encompassing for work management, project and portfolio management, and resource management, with an intuitive and user-friendly interface that appeals to non-technical users for a wide range of use cases, in addition to strong visualizations and dashboarding. Two said that Monday.com's core work management functionalities (not the Dev product) are adequate for technical users too, although this was not the majority view. All the customers we spoke to were users of the Enterprise tier for work management (four out of five have at least 1,000 seats). They described Monday.com as having enterprise-grade scalability (e.g., portfolio management allows for 200 connected boards), security and data governance (e.g., role-based access controls and permissions), and advanced analytics. Onboarding and post-sales support are cited as strong, with seamless SSO/Active Directory integration and high customer success engagement.

Below we summarize comments about Monday.com vs. specific competitors:  vs. Asana: Nearly all the customers and partners we spoke to said Monday can do essentially everything Asana does while offering deeper agile planning and visualizations. Asana was described as older technology, good for task management and documentation but generally for lighter weight use cases. That said, one of the customers chose to standardize multiple project management solutions, including Monday.com, onto Asana, due primarily to lower costs, but also cited preference for the way Asana triages and funnels projects into different teams and helps manage product releases vs. other tools.  vs. Smartsheet: Customers and partners said that Smartsheet has enterprise-grade scalability and can handle essentially unlimited projects, but the user experience is rigid and limited to a spreadsheet experience. It's best suited for teams that need to do computations (e.g., finance)

within the spreadsheet format, whereas Monday is viewed as a more de facto enterprise-wide collaboration tool for all types of workflows.

 vs. Jira (Atlassian): Four out of the five customers we spoke to used Jira alongside Monday.com. The consensus view, including from the two partners, is that Jira remains preferred for engineering-centric agile workflows, but is seen as less user-friendly outside of engineering and product teams. By comparison, Monday.com is easier to configure and requires less platform expertise for business teams, while also having significantly better visualizations.  vs. Microsoft: Microsoft's comparable work management capabilities are spread across multiple products (e.g., Project/Planner, Lists, etc.), which is a barrier to adoption and integration. However, the initial response from CIOs to adopting Monday.com is that all work collaboration can be done within Microsoft, taking into account M365 and copilot capabilities. Partners say that upon closer evaluation, Monday.com tends to still win out given its tightly integrated standalone capabilities, but it's at a slower sales process and not at the expense of Microsoft licenses.

 vs. Others (Airtable, Coda, ClickUp, Wrike, Planview, Workfront). These vendors/solutions came up more sporadically. A few customers said there were small cohorts of either Airtable (which has a spreadsheetlike interface) and Coda (document and task management) in their organizations for interdepartmental task or project management, but they are both less in-depth compared to Monday.com. One customer replaced Workfront (prior to its acquisition by Adobe) with Monday.com. There were also a few mentions of ClickUp, Wrike, and Planview, which customers described as older technologies, while Monday stands out for deeper project management and enterprise features.

Favorable Pricing . Across our checks, there was a relatively wide range of per seat pricing for work management, depending on when the customer started using Monday.com and seat count/volume discounts. As a reminder, every customer we spoke to had at least 1,000 seats. Monday.com has been gradually bringing previously discounted pricing to list price, which we believe could be a modest tailwind for several years (about 1-2% per management). For recently signed new customers, we believe maximum discounting is 10%. Customers noted that Monday.com is generally less expensive than Smartsheet or Asana, representing great value, while annual price increases are significantly less than Jira (which has been in the high single digit range).

Monday.com has made early progress cross-selling its CRM, Dev, and Service products, which collectively represent 10% of Total ARR, or over $130M today. Of the five customers we spoke to, in addition to work management, one also used Monday.com CRM and Service and another used Dev (note this represents a higher mix vs. Monday's FY25 analyst day stat that 6% of customers use 2+

products). Four out of five were exploring adopting either CRM, Service, or Dev. Both Monday.com partners have also evaluated CRM, Service, and Dev extensively. In general, there is strong interest for CRM as a natural expansion to work management, although Monday.com's current scalability limits it to simpler sales processes and more targeted marketing efforts (generally associated with smaller customers). Scalability will improve significantly with the impending launch of MondayDB 3.1. Feedback to Dev has been more positive than we expected, with a couple of customers saying out-of-the-box features are comparable with Atlassian Jira; however, Jira is extremely sticky given customizations and its deep entrenchment in engineering culture. Meanwhile, feedback on Service (generally available only since February 2025) has been mixed depending on when customers first trialed the product. The latest perception is that Service is fullfeatured vs. products like Jira Service Management, Freshworks, and BMC Remedy, and is the fastest growing product for Monday.com. Below we recap the feedback from our conversations.

Partners and customers say that Monday.com has successfully extended its userfriendly interface to effectively manage customers, leads, opportunities, with intuitive dashboards for tracking sales pipeline and sales activity. Monday.com CRM is suitable mostly for companies with more simplified sales processes and/or those that don't mass target leads and opportunities. Currently with MondayDB 2.0, customers are limited to 100K items per board (e.g., an item can be an account, customers, opportunity, etc.) and connecting up to 50 boards per dashboard. While there isn't a direct correlation between sales process complexity or number of customers and customer size, in general, enterprise customers (which Monday.com defines as those with >1,500 employees) have higher scalability needs vs. midmarket (100-1,500 employees) and SMB (up to 100 employees). Note that Monday is in the process of expanding scalability to 1M leads and contacts and 1K boards within a dashboard as part of MondayDB 3.1 (expected in 4Q25), which one partner said should quickly open

more enterprise opportunities. -  vs. Competition : All five customers (all large enterprises) use Salesforce for CRM, including two that said they have other workflows deeply ingrained in Salesforce, including service management (both external and internal) and marketing, which can be difficult to move off. One of the customers (the one already using Monday.com for CRM and Service) is actively exploring expanding CRM to other business units for managing departmental sales processes. The two partners said that Monday.com CRM makes the most sense for existing smaller enterprise work management customers given a common user experience.

According to multiple customers and partners, Monday.com has done an impressive job adapting work management functionalities to how software

developers/engineers are accustomed to working (e.g., sprint planning, backlog management, retrospectives, features prioritization, etc.). Additionally, there are advantages in having developers and other teams (e.g., product, project management, marketing) use the same software. For example, during application updates, when developers are running sprints and choose to deprioritize working on a feature to focus on fixing a bug, Monday.com Dev seamlessly communicates these changes to project management teams working in the work management product.

-  vs. Competition: The main competition for Monday.com Dev is Atlassian's Jira. A couple of customers that did side-by-side comparisons concluded that Monday.com has nearly all the agile development processes and sprint planning/tracking as Jira, making Monday.com a viable replacement option. They also said visualizations and reporting are strengths over Jira. Others said that Jira features are more comprehensive, especially given the extensive customizations that are built over time. Additionally, Jira is culturally ingrained in many engineering orgs, making it extremely hard to displace. On the other hand, one customer migrated from Broadcom Rally software (formerly CA Agile Central) and now runs planning, bug tracking, and user stories in Monday.com.

According to a large and longstanding Monday.com partner, there is strong early adoption and interest globally of Monday.com Service, which is outpacing the growth of CRM in its initial months. However, the product was only recently made generally available (February 2025), so depending on when customers first got exposure to the product, feedback has been mixed. For example, some said that relative to alternative service management products, there are feature gaps in Monday.com's knowledge base, self-service portal, and asset management. On the other hand, the customer that currently uses Service said that the product was full featured vs. both Jira Service Management (which is used in another business unit) and Freshservice. -  vs. Competition. Among three customers, one is evaluating Monday.com Service vs. Zendesk and Jira Service Management, while another was looking to replace BMC Remedy with Monday.com, while also evaluating Freshservice, and a third (which already uses Service) is planning to expand other departmental service management use cases onto Monday.com.

Four out of the five customers we spoke to said they are actively exploring expansions on Monday.com either via additional work management seats or migration onto Service, CRM, or Dev from competing products. The fifth customer plans to consolidate multiple work management solutions onto Asana, primarily due to cost/a higher volume discount. On average, customers said they expect about 10% annual seat expansion in work management (range of 7-15%

growth) driven by headcount growth in roles that use Monday.com supported by new project work, and consolidation onto Monday.com. Most common planned migrations include pockets of Asana and Smartsheet into Monday.com. Planned migrations to Dev are occurring in select organizations (e.g., one customer moved from Broadcom's CA Rally software), but overall expansion is more limited given Jira's entrenchment in the market. Potential migrations to Monday.com Service from Jira Service Management and Freshservice represent opportunity too, although enterprises typically don't need as many Service seats vs. work management. All said, price increases have been modest at about 2-3% per year, which they expect to continue. One of the customers (a large work management user) said that adoption of AI products could be their biggest potential increase in terms of spend.

Customers and partners gave consistent positive feedback about Monday.com's AI capabilities, which are embedded across Work Management, CRM, Service, and Dev. AI Blocks (capabilities include information extraction, summarization, categorization, and sentiment analysis) and Vibe (create apps directly within Monday.com using natural language prompts, i.e., vibe coding) seem to have the highest usage, resulting in notable productivity increases. Meanwhile, Monday Magic (which is free) helps new and existing users get started on quickly creating new projects, which saves some time, while Sidekick (no additional charge currently) can produce similar time savings, but customers said is less differentiated relative to any other in-app copilot today. With regards to pricing and monetization, both customers and partners say Vibe is attractively priced at only $10/month/app (and most aren't paying anything due to free trials prior to general availability). AI Blocks has the most potential to become a material part

of customers' Monday.com invoices near-term, especially given the recent revamp that limits free trials to a one-time trial credit (vs. credits that refresh monthly before). Below we share customer feedback:

 Use of AI Blocks in work management, CRM, and Service have been 'phenomenal.' On the CRM side, it can summarize client notes, detect sentiment, and calculate the probability that a customer will buy additional products, and display summaries in slick visualizations. On the Service side, it is useful for root care analysis, AI summarization of ticket categories and recurring issues, and classifying severity based on content within the ticket.  Sidekick gets more useful with data density and increased usage; it can highlight what's on track vs. delayed, to enhance execution management.  One partner built several custom apps for prospects that helped win >$100K deals; the relative cost of $120/year is a drop in the bucket and the app only took hours to create vs. building a similar custom app that would have taken months.

 The other partner said that roughly 20% of his clients have adopted Monday.com's AI capabilities. Monday's AI is seen as more useful and better integrated than comparable tools like Atlassian's Rovo.  Relative to peers, one customer said that Notion is the laggard in terms of generative AI capabilities, while Monday and Asana are similar, and Jira below all of these.

Monday.com, originally branded as 'DaPulse,' was first launched in 2012 by three co-founders, Roy Mann, Eran Zinman, and Eran Kampf, all of whom worked at Wix at the time. At Wix, they leveraged Monday.com as an internal collaboration tool to effectively communicate and manage their work. The company was spun out into its own company and in 2014 launched its first commercial product. The company's vision was to build a highly intuitive way for teams to manage their work. In 2016, Monday.com secured a $25M Series B funding round, solidifying their footing in the investment community and unleashing their vision for the company. See Exhibit 13 for Monday.com's key milestones.

Replacing Complex Work Management Processes. Monday.com set out to solve the traditional pain points in siloed team collaboration, including lack of transparency and process management, especially as organizations scale. Communication would be scattered across email, chats, spreadsheets, meetings, etc., leading to difficulty in managing the status of tasks, who was assigned to each task, and identifying bottlenecks. Existing tools were rigid and inflexible, leading users to adapt to certain structures that weren't customizable and often hard for non-technical users. Monday.com introduced a single source of truth for managing all types of work that included a visually engaging, flexible, and easyto-adopt way to organize and manage different kinds of work tasks. Fast forward to today, Monday.com has proven its right to win in work management, demonstrated by their viral adoption of its core product by more than 2.5M users, and has since expanded into adjacent markets.

Expansion into Other Products. Even as Monday.com began as a workmanagement tool, in 2020, its transformation into a 'Work OS' platform allowed teams to build custom workflow applications in a flexible, low-code/no-code fashion. In 2022, the company launched Monday CRM, allowing sales, operations, marketing and adjacent teams to collaborate on customer lifecycle management into a unified system. In 4Q25, Monday.com released Monday Campaigns, an AI-powered campaign management tool within CRM. Monday.com also expanded into the DevOp category in 2023 with the launch of Dev, which is designed for product, engineering and design teams to manage the software development lifecycle. Finally, Monday.com expanded into ITSM with the introduction of Service, launched in 2025.

GTM Evolution. Monday.com primarily started with a bottom-up, self-serve model driven heavily by performance marketing and focusing on mostly SMB and mid-market customers. As the product matured, the company began incorporating a direct sales model and leveraging a partner ecosystem. This has enabled more cross-sell and up-sell opportunities. See Go-to-Market Model for more details.

MondayDB is the underlying data architecture that powers the Monday.com WorkOS platform, built from the ground up to support greater scale at speed for dashboards and boards, broader use cases, and custom workflows. According to management, MondayDB serves as a management layer that sits on top of other databases to provide controls over permissions/role-based access controls, automations, and triggers. For example, when different users change rows or roll up boards into a dashboard, or when a change to a field is set to trigger an event, MondayDB serves as the control plane. This has a significant compounding effect across Monday.com's various products. The company has announced three different versions since this new architecture was first introduced in 2023, which we describe below. Refer to Exhibit 22.

MondayDB 1.0 was introduced in 2023 to replace the company's previous architecture to support much larger and more complex workflows. This has enabled much greater performance, delivering up to 5x faster board loading, realtime data updates and support for advanced queries and automations. Beneath this infrastructure lies a schema-less architecture that separates compute and storage to optimize the greatest scale and flexibility needed for the Work OS platform.

Launched in 2024, MondayDB 2.0 was targeted at Enterprise accounts and shifted the focus from performance to scalability. This enabled greater support for larger dashboards and boards, with up to 100,000 items per board and 500,000 items per dashboard.

Within MondayDB 3.0, which is currently being rolled out, the focus is on providing additional scalability for new use cases and data volumes across the product portfolio. As of 3Q25, Work Management supports 1,000 projects in one portfolio. In 4Q25, as part of MondayDB 3.1, CRM will be able to handle 1M leads and contacts and 1,000 boards in a single dashboard, while MondayDB 3.2 (expected to be available in 2026) will enable 1M tickets in Service. Management is targeting to eventually get to 15 million contacts and leads for CRM and 15 million tickets in Service, which would significantly open up the large enterprise opportunity.

This is Monday.com's in-house business intelligence tool that collects and processes data to deliver insights. It is built directly into Monday's Work OS platform to ease automation, data analysis, and smart suggestions in a centralized platform. By leveraging AI, BigBrain has the proper context for how teams across an organization operate, and can then provide real-time support through the automation of repetitive tasks, summarization tools, or the generation of content for emails and reports. BigBrain also helps power AI assistants and tools within Monday.com, bringing intelligent decision making and efficiency directly into the platform.

Self-Service  Outbound Sales. Monday.com's go-to-market motion has historically been a digital marketing driven, self-service sales approach but has been gradually shifting to more of an outbound enterprise sales-led motion. Traditionally, partly due to the non-technical nature of the product, users would sign up for the platform and immediately start gaining value. Adoption of additional Monday.com product SKUs or features from the marketplace, which are all built on the same platform, are seamless and require limited sales assistance. However, as Monday.com has expanded beyond SMB (<100 employees) and

mid-market (100-1,500) enterprises, buying decisions often involve the CIO and procurement teams, in addition to cross-departmental buy-in. Therefore, the company has expanded its outbound sales effort to better service these accounts, including more recently starting to offer targeted product bundles for different use cases. Account reps are specialized by region and customer size, with sales manager variable comp weighted more toward new logos and customer success variable comp weighted more towards retention stats. Monday.com has also invested in a partner channel, which include 266 active channel partners (up 8% y/y) and accounts for 20% of ARR today.

 Performance Marketing  SLG. Google AdWords currently represents less than 10% of New ARR. With the introduction of AI overviews in Google Search, Monday.com has begun shifting its performance marketing dollars from Google into other social/online channels and PLG opportunities. The company has also placed a greater emphasis on SLG initiatives, which typically have a cash payback period of 15-18 months, compared to performance marketing of 9-12 months. By leveraging the power of BigBrain, the company can track and identify campaigns to understand the value of each visitor and know which campaign brought in a lead.

 Targeted Upmarket Cross-Sell Strategy. As Monday.com has moved more upmarket, it recognizes that not all of its products are suitable for large enterprises, which typically already use a slew of software vendors. For mid-market enterprises, the company tries to sell Monday CRM and Service alongside Work Management. Meanwhile, for large enterprises that typically are deeply entrenched in Salesforce for CRM and also ServiceNow for ITSM, Monday.com tries to position Service for other departments outside of IT. In other words, it is trying to co-exist with some of the big software providers in the industry in the large enterprise. See Exhibit 23.

Monday.com's pricing is based on the plan tier and number of users. These tiers vary for Monday Work Management, CRM, Dev, and Service. Work Management comes in five separate editions (Free, Basic, Standard, Pro, Enterprise). CRM

and Dev come in Basic, Standard, Pro and Enterprise. Service is offered only for Standard, Pro, and Enterprise pricing. Payment can be made either monthly or annually. Today, more than 90% of Total ARR comes from the Pro and Enterprise tiers, including over 50% of Total ARR from the Enterprise tier. Meanwhile, 38% of New ARR is from the Enterprise tier vs. 25% at the time of the IPO in 2021. Larger customers typically need the security and scalability available only in the Enterprise tier. See a summary of what is included in each pricing tier and feature set below. We show prices for annual billing terms (prices for monthly billing terms are slightly higher).

Thus far, Monday.com has launched the following AI features: Magic, Vibe, AI Blocks, Sidekick, Vibe, Agent Factory (part of broader Agents capabilities to roll out in 1H26). Other than Magic, which is included for free, all the other features

either are, or will be, priced based on usage. Certain AI features have different pricing structures, which we detail below:

 Monday Magic. Existing Monday.com users have access to Monday Magic, which is embedded directly into workspaces for no additional charge.  Monday Sidekick. Currently in Beta, there is no additional charge for using Monday Sidekick, but that may change in the future, according to the company.  AI Blocks. AI credits are charged per item, rather than per action. If multiple AI actions are on the same item within 24 hours, only one credit will be charged. Each account receives a one-time credit trial, which varies by tier. There are also built-in AI features that are free to use and require no credits, which include Summarization, Adding Columns, Filtering and Building Workforms. o Customers are given 750 credits for non-enterprise plans and 1,500 credits for enterprise plans. These AI credits are charged when any task that is intentionally set by a user is run, part of an automation cycle or using an AI-powered feature. Customers will then need to purchase additional credits to continue leveraging the power of Monday AI.

 Monday Vibe. Monday Vibe will be primarily charged per app built and price will vary depending on tier. See Exhibit 24.

Source: Monday.com 3Q25 Shareholder Letter -  Agent Factory (part of Monday.com Agents). This product can be accessed as a standalone offering outside of Monday.com. Agent credits are used when an agent performs an action; the number of credits used will depend on the type of task. Agents will be paused once the credit limit is reached and will only resume when additional credits are added. An additional 10,000 Agent Credits cost $99/month. See Exhibit 25.

Contract and invoicing terms. Approximately 70% of contracts are one year in length, with the remainder multi-year (about 17%) or monthly (13%), as of 1H25. The mix of annual contracts has been relatively steady over the last couple of years. See Exhibit 26. Subscription revenue contracts are typically paid in full upfront at the outset of the arrangement.

Source: Monday.com FY25 Investor Day Presentation Revenue recognition terms. Customers are granted access to the software over the contractual agreement and are accounted for as service contracts. Revenue for these arrangements is recognized ratably over the length of the contract. ARR. Monday.com calculates ARR as the annualized value of customer subscription plans, assuming that any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms.

Gross Revenue Retention Rate. At its FY25 Investor Day, Monday.com detailed a slide highlighting the company's ongoing GRR improvement. Based on our conversations with management, Monday.com's SMB cohort accounts for 40% of ARR and a high 70s % GRR; its Midmarket cohort accounts for 30% of ARR and a mid-80s % GRR; and its Enterprise cohort accounts for 25% of ARR and a mid90s % GRR. Therefore, we believe Monday.com's Gross Revenue Retention Rate is in the mid-80s % as of 2Q25 and has increased approximately 800 bps over the last four years. See Exhibit 27. Exhibit 27: Monday.com Gross Revenue Retention Rate, 2Q21-2Q25 Source: Monday.com FY25 Investor Day Presentation

Net Dollar Retention Rate (NDR). Monday.com defines NDR as the percentage change in ARR derived from the customer base at a point in time. NDR at the end of period is calculated by starting with customers as of the 12 months prior to such period end, or the Prior Period ARR. ARR is then calculated for these customers as of the current period end, or the Current Period ARR. The calculation of Current Period ARR includes any upsells, price adjustments, user growth within a customer, contraction, and attrition. NDR is equal to Current Period ARR divided by Prior Period ARR. See Exhibit 28 for historical NDR. Exhibit 28: Monday.com Net Dollar Retention Rate, 1Q23-3Q25 Source: Monday.com company reports and Guggenheim Securities, LLC estimates

ARR by Customer Size. Monday.com defines SMB as companies with <100 employees and mid-market as companies with 100-1,500 employees, while enterprise is greater than 1,500 employees. Below we outline the ARR mix by customer size across Monday.com's products. See Exhibits 29-32.

Medium Term (FY27) Targets. At its FY25 Investor Day in September 2025, management provided the following FY27 targets.  Revenue: $1.8B revenue target.  Non-GAAP gross margin: Incremental AI-related compute costs will moderate gross margins to mid-80%.

 Non-GAAP S&M % of revenue: Drive down to 40% as a percentage of revenue.  Non-GAAP R&D % of revenue: Continue to invest in organic innovation (AI, new products).  Non-GAAP G&A % of revenue: Drive efficiency through automation and streamlined internal workflows. Long-Term (FY30) Margin Targets. At its FY25 investor day, management also provided long-term targets (in about five years or by FY30) for both Non-GAAP operating margin of 20-25% and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of at least 30%.

At its FY25 Investor Day, CFO Eliran Glazer outlined a capital allocations plan that balances both investment into the business and the return of capital to shareholders. With regards to M&A, the company detailed that any potential acquisitions would mostly be tuck-ins aimed at accelerating the product roadmap and providing additional features and functionalities to enhance Monday CRM. Mr. Glazer said acquisitions in the tens of millions to $200M range would be most appropriate, and that Monday.com is not interested in acquiring revenue or customers. The company announced an $870M share repurchase program, targets keeping share repurchases below 10% of Monday.com's market cap, and is targeting 2% share dilution over the long term.

We employ a rigorous academic approach to a three-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis to derive the intrinsic value of any Software stock, using conservative assumptions where appropriate. We typically assume a terminal period free cash flow (FCF) margin of about 35%, which we believe is about the FCF margin for a relatively mature Software company at scale that is growing at about the long-term growth rate of the economy. In other words, we assume the company is run relatively efficiently in the terminal period during which it has ceased trying to grow the company at elevated rates. For some companies, we may adjust this terminal FCF margin to account for anomalies in its financial model, such as third-party tolls not experienced by typical Software businesses, or in cases that have demonstrated higher FCF margins at steady state.

Our base case DCF analysis, which is based on FY25 guidance and consensus estimates, assumes a revenue CAGR of 18% from FY25-FY30 (the hyper-growth period) followed by linear deceleration in the transitionary period to reach 5% growth in the terminal period. We assume FCF margin (adjusted for stock-based compensation) expands from about 23% in FY25E to 35% in the terminal period where FCF reaches a steady-state 5% growth rate into perpetuity. Our base case yields an NPV/share of $237 about 55% above the current share price.

Our plausible case DCF analysis, on which we are basing our price target, assumes a revenue CAGR of 19% from FY25-FY30 (the hyper growth period) followed by linear deceleration to 5% in the terminal period. We assume the same FCF margins as in our base case, reaching 35% in the terminal period while FCF sustains 5% annual growth into perpetuity. Our plausible case yields a price target of $250, implying approximately 64% upside potential. See Exhibit 50.

Our $250 PT is based on a 3-stage DCF analysis and implies 8.0x EV/NTM Recurring Revenue (6.3x FY27E) and 28.3x EV/NTM FCF (21.9x FY27E), vs. current multiples of 4.4x NTM Recurring Revenue (3.5x FY27E) and 15.5x NTM FCF (12.0x FY27E). MNDY trades significantly below the average NTM multiples (based on consensus estimates) of 6.0x and 25.7x, respectively, for the average of eight Software peers that have lower revenue growth and FCF margin (FY26E revenue growth of 16% vs. MNDY's 21% and FY26E FCF margin of 22% vs. MNDY's 27%). In fact, MNDY shares are the least expensive on a

growthadjusted basis (2.0x vs. 3.6x peer average). Even if we assume 0% revenue and FCF growth in the terminal year, the DCF-implied price target is still about 20% higher than the current price. See Exhibit 45.
