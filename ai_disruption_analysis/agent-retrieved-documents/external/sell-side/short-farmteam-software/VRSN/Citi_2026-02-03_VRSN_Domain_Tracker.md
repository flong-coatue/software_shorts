VeriSign, Inc. (VRSN.O) | Buy Monthly Domain Tracker: .Com Growth Accelerates ~40bps to +3.4% Y/Y in Jan. ’25 with Total Domains +3.0% Y/Y 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 ET Jamesmichael Sherman-Lewis AC jamesmichael.shermanlewis@citi.com +1-415-627-6014 Ronald Josey ronald.josey@citi.com +1-212-816-4545 Maxwell Moore maxwell.moore@citi.com +1-212-816-4639 Jake Hallac, CFA jake.hallac@citi.com +1-212-816-2001 Flagship | MustC | Risk & Adaptation Investment Strategies | | Super-Sector Analysis | Innovation Lab | CITI'S TAKE

Our January domain tracker highlights a 13th consecutive M/M increase in Verisign domains, with total domain growth accelerating ~40bps to +3.0% Y/Y, driven by a ~40bps acceleration in .com growth to +3.4% Y/Y. In our view, strengthening .com domain growth trends underscore continued marketing benefits, GenAI lowering the barriers to entry for online presence (e.g. with vibe coding and facilitating domain acquisition), as well as continued share gains from .net. Looking ahead to VRSN’s 4Q25 earnings (reporting AMC 02/05), with Dec. ’25 total domains +2.6% Y/Y to 173.519M — exceeding the high-end of FY domain guidance of 172.7M-173.2M — we expect upside to our 4Q revenues and OI, while listening for insights into the durability of domain growth acceleration in 1H26 given positive January trends. Verisign Total Domain Name Base

: Verisign’s total domain name base (.com and .net) through 2/1/26 was 174.266M (+3.0% Y/Y), up 747K from 173.519M on 1/1/26. The gain marked a 13 th consecutive M/M increase and a ~40bps acceleration in Y/Y growth from last month. .com Domains : .com domain names through 2/1/26 were 161.895M (+3.4% Y/Y), +844K from 1/1/26’s 161.051M. This was the 13 th consecutive M/M increase and a ~40bps acceleration in Y/Y growth from last month. .net Domains : .net domain names through 2/1/26 were 12.371M (-2.3% Y/Y), -97K from 12/1/25’s 12.468M, and marking the largest M/M decline since Nov. ‘24. Methodology : This note analyzes daily domain data aggregated from Verisign.com

in partnership with Citi’s Innovation Lab. Our daily domain name counts are aggregated through publicly available data on Verisign.com consisting of .com, .net, and the aggregated total.

Verisign provides domain name registry and Internet infrastructure services. Verisign acts as the authoritative registry (meaning it is the sole registry) for .com and .net top-level domains (TLDs) and operates two of the 13 global Internet root servers. The company holds a registry agreement with ICANN for its .com and .net business which regulates pricing. This contract for .com was renewed in November 2024. Verisign was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in Reston, VA. Investment strategy We rate Verisign a Buy. We view Verisign as being one of the safer plays in Internet with a narrower range of outcomes given its almost utility-like nature as a domain registry, ability to pass on regular price increases that leads to a resiliant top-line, and best in class EBITDA margins, providing what we believe to be an attractive risk/reward for investors. Valuation

Our target price of $337 per share is based on an even weighting of our projected DCF ($333, using a 7.7% WACC and 2.5% terminal growth rate), 2026E EV/EBITDA multiple (26.5x), and 2026E PE multiple (35x). We justify our valuation given Verisign's slower but steady growth profile, strong pricing power, and robust margins. We note the implied 2026 EV/EBITDA and PE multiples based on our TP are slightly above Verisign's five-year averages of 21x and 28x, respectively. Risks Risks to our target price being achieved include: 1) unexpected development with the agreement with ICANN for .com and .net; 2) future contract renewal with ICANN does not allow for price increase; and 3) newer domain names that Verisign does not have authoritative registry status over continue to see faster growth due to their lower saturation.

The research analysts primarily responsible for the preparation and content of this research report are either (i) designated by “AC” in the author block or (ii) listed in bold alongside content which is attributable to that analyst. If multiple AC analysts are designated in the author block, each analyst is certifying with respect to the entire research report other than (a) content attributable to another AC certifying analyst listed in bold alongside the content and (b) views expressed solely with respect to a specific issuer which are attributable to another AC certifying analyst identified in the price charts or rating history tables for that issuer shown below. Each of these analysts certify, with respect to the sections of the report for which they are responsible: (1) that the views expressed therein accurately reflect their personal views about each issuer and security referenced and were prepared in an independent manner, including with respect to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates; and (2) no part of the research analyst's compensation was, is, or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the specific recommendations or views expressed by that research analyst in this report.

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or its affiliates received compensation for products and services other than investment banking services from VeriSign, Inc. in the past 12 months. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or its affiliates currently has, or had within the past 12 months, the following as clients, and the services provided were non-investment-banking, non-securities-related: VeriSign, Inc.. Analysts’ compensation is determined by Citi Research management and Citigroup’s senior management and is based upon activities and services intended to benefit the investor clients of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates (the “Firm”). Compensation is not linked to specific transactions or recommendations. Like all Firm employees, analysts receive compensation that is impacted by overall Firm profitability which includes investment banking, sales and trading, and principal trading revenues. One factor in equity research analyst compensation is arranging corporate access events between institutional clients and the management teams of covered companies. Typically, company management is more likely to participate when the analyst has a positive view of the company.

For financial instruments recommended in the Product in which the Firm is not a market maker, the Firm is a liquidity provider in such financial instruments (and any underlying instruments) and may act as principal in connection with transactions in such instruments. The Firm is a regular issuer of traded financial instruments linked to securities that may have been recommended in the Product. The Firm regularly trades in the securities of the issuer(s) discussed in the Product. The Firm may engage in securities transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Product and, with respect to securities covered by the Product, will buy or sell from customers on a principal basis. Unless stated otherwise neither the Research Analyst nor any member of their team has viewed the material operations of the Companies for which an investment view has been provided within the past 12 months.

Data current as of 01 Jan 2026 Buy Hold Sell Buy Hold Sell Citi Research Global Fundamental Coverage (Neutral=Hold) 60% 32% 8% 37% 47% 16% % of companies in each rating category that are investment banking clients 36% 40% 28% 40% 34% 35% Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings: Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned. Investment Ratings:

Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign “Rating Suspended” status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—“ and “-“ respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned “Under Review” status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
