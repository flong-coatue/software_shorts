Another strong beat and raise, but AI progress still not visible

· MDB posted another encouraging beat and raise, accelerating Atlas revenue by a point to +30% Y/Y and outperforming significantly on income and FCF. · We're raising our TP to $385 from $305 on meaningfully higher revenue, operating income, and FCF estimates. MDB ~+20% after-market. · We think MDB's long-term future likely depends on an AI-driven transformation of its market position, not yet visible.

MDB posted another encouraging beat and raise, with $34M in revenue outperformance and a $79M FY26 revenue increase at the high end of the range. Atlas accelerated by one point to 30% Y/Y, driven by sustained strength among the largest U.S. customers, broad-based momentum in EMEA, new workloads, and the expansion of existing workloads. Consumption trends were stable Y/Y. Non-Atlas ARR grew 8% Y/Y, with expansion in the existing EA customer base and stronger-than-anticipated multiyear revenue driving outperformance. Operating margin and FCF beat our estimates by large amounts on revenue outperformance, good cost control, and delays in strategic investments into 4Q and FY27. Management remains committed to its long-term model from its September investment day, targeting 100-200 bps non-GAAP operating margin expansion "on average." We expect operating margin to expand by somewhat less than this range (e.g. 50 bps) next year, due to FY26 outperformance.

We attribute MDB's robust growth trend to strength in its core business, while adoption of MDB's AI tech (vector search, re-ranking and embedding models) isn't significant enough yet to boost results. Management commentary about "not [seeing] AI agents in production that fundamentally transform business" appears to us to be generally accurate. MDB's aspirations to sell its AI tech to enterprises and AI-natives look fair, but the opportunity still looks nascent to us, and the strength of its AI product position largely unproven. Estimate changes: We raise our revenue, EPS and FCF estimates across the board in response to 3Q results and raise to FY26 guidance (see Figure 3). Valuation: We raise our TP to $385 from $305 on higher multiples (see Valuation section), averaging our EV/revenue, EV/FCF, and DCF methods. Catalysts: 4Q earnings expected in early March.

We're incrementally more positive on MDB's GTM execution, but we think long-run success will likely depend on MDB's ability to establish its relevance in AI. However, it's not yet clear if MDB's AI tech will be ready for prime time if enterprise adoption of RAG use cases accelerates.

Total revenue of $628M (+19% Y/Y) beat consensus by $34M, non-GAAP operating margin of 20% was 780 bps ahead of consensus, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.32 was also well ahead of consensus of $0.82. Atlas revenue of $471M accelerated by one point to +30% Y/Y, now comprising 75% of revenue. Management noted that Atlas consumption growth continued at a pace similar to last year, driven by sustained strength among the largest U.S. customers, broad-based momentum in EMEA, new workloads, and the expansion of existing workloads. Non-Atlas revenue also outperformed expectations, with non-Atlas ARR growing by 8% Y/Y. NonAtlas outperformance was driven by expansion within the existing EA customer base and stronger-than-anticipated multiyear revenue, with ~ 2/3 of the non-Atlas revenue beat coming from multiyear deals with an upfront revenue component.

MDB now serves over 70% of the Fortune 100 and sees further expansion opportunities within enterprises. At the end of 3Q, MDB had 2,694 customers with $100,000+ in ARR, up from 2,314 a year earlier, reflecting 16% Y/Y growth. MDB's total customer base grew by ~2,600 customers sequentially and 19% Y/Y, reaching 62,500+, up from 52,600+ in the same period last year. This growth was primarily driven by Atlas, which had 60,800+ customers compared to 51,100+ a year ago. The company's total net ARR expansion rate rose to 120%, up from 119% in the previous quarter.

Gross profit margin was 74%, down from 77% in the prior year, primarily reflecting the increased contribution of Atlas to the business mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, up from 19% a year earlier, driven by stronger-than-expected revenue, cost control, and a delay in strategic investments into 4Q and FY27. FCF rose to $140M, compared to $35M in the previous year, primarily due to operating profit, higher cash collections, and better working capital dynamics as billings headwinds stemming MDB's transition from commitments to consumption abate.

· For 4Q26: Þ MDB guided to revenue of $665M-$670M. Atlas revenue is expected to grow ~27%, higher than prior company expectations of mid-20% range. Þ Non-Atlas subscription revenue is expected to grow in the upper single digits in 4QFY26, driven by a good line of sight on several large multi-year deals. Þ Management expects non-GAAP income from operations of $139M-$443M, with an operating margin of ~21%. Þ Management expects 100% FCF conversion. Þ MDB will continue to execute share buybacks to offset dilution from employee equity awards and expects FY26 to end with 86.5M diluted shares outstanding. Þ Management guided to EPS of $1.44 - $1.48. · For FY26: Þ MDB guided to revenue of $2,434-$2,439M, a $79M increase at the high end of the range. We believe the 3Q beat and good Atlas visibility provides a credible basis for this raise.

Þ FY26 Non-GAAP operating margin high-end guidance increased to 18.1% from 14.0%, thanks to expected operating leverage along with continued strategic investments in engineering, marketing, and direct sales capacity to drive continued growth. Some of these investments have taken longer to implement than expected and have shifted into 4QFY26 and FY27, which benefits FY26 margins. Þ Management expects ~18% operating margin, non-GAAP income from operations of $436M-$440M, and 86.7M non-GAAP taxes. Þ MDB guided to EPS of $4.76-$4.80. · Long-term: Þ Management remains committed to long-term targets provided at its September investment day. Þ Management expects FCF conversion of 80-100%. Þ Management expects non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 100-200 bps annually.

Our 12-month target price of $385 is an average of our EV/revenue, EV/FCF, and DCF approaches (refer to Figure 4 for detailed valuation calculation). We apply a 9.3x EV revenue multiple (down from 8.0x by rolling forward our method from FY26 to FY27) on our CY27E revenue estimate of $37.48 per share and add $33.63 per share in CY27E starting net cash to produce a $382 valuation. Also, we apply a 50x EV/FCF multiple to our CY27E FCF estimate of $7.36 per share (previously 75x on our CY 26 estimate) and add $33.63 in CY27E starting net cash to produce a $402 valuation. Our long-term DCF valuation of $372 is based on a WACC of 11.4 %, a beta of 1.5, and a terminal EV/FCF multiple of 28x (previously 25.5x) in CY34E.

MDB is trading near parity to the Macquarie Growth Software Index on a NTM EV/revenue basis (9.0 vs. 9.2x), representing a 2% discount compared to a 24-month average discount of 7%; see Figures 5 and 6. MDB's 9.0x NTM EV/revenue is 20% above the predicted multiple 7.5x based on the multiple linear regression of EV/revenue to NTM revenue growth and NTM FCF margin ("Rule of X") on our growth software index (Figure 7). On a EV/FCF basis (see Figure 9), MDB is trading above our growth software index on CY25E (56.1x vs 28.6x), CY26E (54.8x vs. 24.0x), and CY27E (40.5x vs 20.8x). TP Impacts FactSet Data

· Continued growth through deeper penetration of high-value customer contracts and vendor consolidation; · Effective cross-selling and up-selling motions; · An uptick in cloud spending and the continued migration of workloads to the cloud; · Outperformance in revenue growth, margin expansion, and cash flow generation.

· Intensified competition; · Risks of service disruptions, cybersecurity incidents, performance degradation, or outages; · Challenges in penetrating new markets; · Negative shifts in the economic, political, regulatory, or market environments; · Non-compliance with laws, regulations, rules, and standards; · Failure to meet elevated expectations due to operational hiccups.

· Increased migrations from legacy providers to Snowflake's cloud data platform, allowing SNOW to sustain a high growth rate. · Success disrupting the Big Data analytics market and/or monetization of its Data Marketplace/data sharing features. · Accelerated IT spending in the cloud. · Revenue, operating margin, cash flow outperformance allowing SNOW to maintain its relatively high trading multiples.

· Execution risk or faster-than-expected revenue deceleration, coupled with high trading multiples, that could re-rate shares lower. · Pricing pressure, platform improvements, and/or consumption slowdowns that impact revenue. · Increase competition from cloud majors or innovative privates (e.g., Databricks). · Departure of key executives or sales personnel. · Deterioration of macro environment.

Upside risks include the following: · Re-acceleration of Atlas revenue growth. · Rapid adoption of NoSQL technology and MDB's premier NoSQL offerings. · Better-than-expected conversion of open-source and free tier MDB users. · Increased customer adoption, deeper penetration of solutions, and acceleration of high-ACV customers. · Revenue and cash flow outperformance to maintain MDB's relatively high trading multiples. Downside risks include the following: · Unexpected revenue deceleration. · Execution risks coupled with relatively high trading multiples. · Increased competition from major cloud vendors in DBMS for new workloads. · Deterioration of the macroeconomic environment.

MongoDB (MDB) is a leading general-purpose database for modern application development. MDB uses a non-relational, document-based architecture, allowing developers to store and query data in a flexible file format well-adapted to modern development styles. MongoDB's open-source roots have contributed to an engaged developer community and widely deployed products. MDB's main commercial offerings are MongoDB Atlas (a fully managed cloud database-as-aservice) and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced (for on-premise, hybrid, and private cloud workloads). Atlas revenue in FY24 grew at ~36.8% Y/Y; as the end of FY24 the service has 46,300+ paying customers and is available in 110+ regions worldwide. MDB offers a free-to-download Community Server under the Server-Side Public License.

MDB was founded in 2007 by Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz, and Kevin Ryan, the former founders of the internet ad company DoubleClick (acquired by Hellman & Friedman and JMI Equity for $1.1B in 2005, and later by Google for $3.1B in 2007). MDB changed its name from 10gen to MongoDB (the name of its product) in 2013; MDB completed its IPO in October 2017 on the NASDAQ at $24/ share, raising ~$192 million. The company is headquartered in New York and has 5,200+ employees as of April 2024.
