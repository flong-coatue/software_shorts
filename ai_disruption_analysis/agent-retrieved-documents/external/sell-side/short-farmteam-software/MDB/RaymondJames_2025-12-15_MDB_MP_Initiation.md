We are initiating coverage of MongoDB (MDB) with a Market Perform rating. We think the company enters pivotal strategic crossroads shaped by 1) The rise of AI and agentic applications, which demand flexible data infrastructure capable of unifying operational, unstructured, and vector workloads, and 2) intensifying competition from Postgres, opensource ecosystems, and analytical platforms expanding into transactional territory as enterprises consolidate fragmented data estates. MongoDB remains one of the most strategically important independent database platforms, but we see the stock debate becoming increasingly balanced. Performance will hinge on its ability to 1) deliver sustainable 20%-plus growth with a Rule of 40-plus profile, 2) navigate a consumptiondriven revenue model with limited near-term visibility and potential volatility from Atlas usage patterns or non-Atlas deal structures, and 3) maintain developer and enterprise mindshare amidst a growing field of well-funded, increasingly interoperable alternatives.

A Platform Built for Modern Applications and the AI Era. MongoDB's document model aligns with modern software development and AI-driven systems, natively supporting unstructured data, dynamic schemas, real-time processing, and vector representations. These capabilities allow organizations to consolidate operational data, embeddings, semantic context, and event streams into a unified platform. As enterprises modernize legacy systems and deploy AI features at scale, we see MongoDB emerging as a bridge between enterprise data and emerging agentic workloads. With <2% share of a ~$140B opportunity, long-term upside remains substantial if MongoDB continues deepening relevance within large accounts.

Atlas Consumption and Migration as Multiyear Catalysts. Atlas is ~75% of revenue and touches 95%-plus of customers as the primary growth engine, benefiting from a frictionless self-serve funnel and natural workload expansion as applications scale. Non-Atlas deployments represent only a low-single-digit share of customers yet deliver ~15x higher average spend, underscoring the potential multiyear catalyst from migrating strategic workloads to Atlas. Multi-cloud neutrality, modernization tooling, and a distributed architecture position MongoDB to capture incremental operational and AI workloads as enterprises re-platform mission-critical applications.

Balancing Growth Durability With Consumption-Model Volatility. MongoDB offers a rare combination of growth at scale and expanding margins, with long-term targets of 20%-plus Atlas growth and Rule of 40-plus status on the path to $5B-plus ARR. Precedent from other database vendors reinforces this trajectory's feasibility. Still, Atlas' usage-based model reduces visibility and can amplify volatility, while non-Atlas deal terms add another layer of variability. Sustained execution and consistent Atlas momentum remain essential to supporting a valuation premium. We are not dogmatic, however, and will be seeking an improved view into consumption confidence, its largest customers migrating to Atlas, momentum with new accounts preferring Atlas, and/or a more attractive risk/reward profile to reevaluate our more cautious view.

We believe MDB can offer long-term value appreciation as its core developer-based database solutions provide requirements for modern applications. MongoDB can also be the bridge to enable AI/ agentic requirements for organizations by enabling outcomes based on organizational specific data. We believe MongoDB has an ample and expanding TAM that provides opportunities for multiple vendors in the database management market. As its growth scales, we expect incremental use cases and product offerings can keep customers within its ecosystem/expand into adjacencies and create durable cash flow.

MongoDB (short for humongous database) is a leading developer database platform that enables organizations to build, scale, and run applications across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments. Its core technology and differentiation are based on being a document-based database that excels at unstructured data. MongoDB's platform is offered as a fully managed service via Atlas or a self-managed solution through Enterprise Advanced; various functionality can be added on such as search or data stream processing. The company was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in New York City.

| $200.00     | $419.00         | NM                         | $550.00     |

MDB currently trades at 11x our FY27 sales estimate. This is a premium to the 10-20% growth and Rule of 40 group (HSD), but discount to 20-30% growth in low teens. We model overall sales growing at a 19% three-year CAGR through FY28, with Atlas having low-/mid-20% growth. We expect a more balanced growth/margin profile, and look for increased visibility into predicting a consumption model in the longer-term. In our bull case, MongoDB experiences strong migration to, and expansion within, Atlas from its highest value accounts. AI/agentic use cases within MongoDB will become more prevlant from enterprises, and AI-native organizations would standardize some database operations around MongoDB. We assume a 14x sales multiple in this scenario, more in line with 20-30% growth.

We are entering the story as MongoDB's trajectory is expected to be shaped by two major secular forces: 1) the rising requirements of AI and agentic applications that demand flexible data systems capable of unifying operational, unstructured, and vector workloads, and 2) the increasing adoption of Postgres and other open-source alternatives as organizations consolidate fragmented database estates into fewer, more interoperable platforms. We believe MongoDB is positioned to benefit from this convergence given its document-based architecture, multi-cloud portability, and expanding platform functionality.

MongoDB's developer-first model continues to anchor its differentiation. Developers do not write code in columns and rows, yet legacy relational databases still require schemas to be predefined and rigidly maintained. MongoDB's document-based approach mirrors how modern applications represent objects in code, reducing operational complexity and accelerating development cycles as workloads scale and evolve. This conceptual alignment has meaningful financial implications by enabling faster application development/iteration, more workloads brought onto the platform, and ultimately more MongoDB consumption as usage expands.

MongoDB's market position is shaped by several structural debates that can influence how investors evaluate the durability of its growth, the breadth of its opportunity set, and the appropriate valuation framework. We summarize bull and bear considerations across key themes to frame where expectations may diverge and which catalysts or risks could drive sentiment. The table highlights how each dynamic can create either an opportunity or a headwind depending on execution, competitive reactions, and workload adoption trends.

| Platform Consolidation   | MongoDB's document model, search, vector capabilities, and stream processing create a single system for diverse workloads that previously required multiple point solutions. ~2/3 of Atlas ARR comes from customers adopting 1+ capability beyond core database shows MongoDB evolving into a broader operational and AI application platform with a long runway for expansion. | Hyperscalers and relational databases are also expanding platform breadth, and multi-model databases are increasingly adequate for a wide range of use cases. Consolidation could therefore shift toward more scaled vendors' bundles, or organizations maylimit rely on best-of-breed and limit the spending on non-core MongoDB offerings.                                       |
| AI/Agentic               | AI-native applications require storing operational data, embeddings, semantic context, and event streams. MongoDB's native JSON model, search, reranking capabilities, and stream processing position it as a natural system of record for AI memory/state. The convergence of structured, unstructured, and vector data can disproportionately benefit MongoDB.                | Purpose-built vector databases mayoffer superior latency, storage density, or scale for high-throughput AI retrieval workloads. If AI architectures favor specialized retrieval systems rather than unified platforms, MongoDB's AI lift could be muted. As with the platform catalyst/risk, scaled database vendors are also pursuing this large opportunity with larger budgets. |
| Cloud Migration          | Non-Atlas/EA customers are a small number, but spend multiples more on average. Migrating even a small portion of these accounts provides multi-year Atlas growth and expansion opportunities. Modernization/migration tools reduce friction in moving mission critical workloads to Atlas.                                                                                     | Regulated or legacy-heavy EA customers maymigrate slower than expected due to compliance, data residency, and application rewrite complexity. Migration friction could cap the EA-to-Atlas opportunity and pressure the durability of long-term Atlas growth.                                                                                                                      |
| Postgres& Alternatives   | MongoDB maintains advantages in horizontal scalability, flexible schema evolution, and unified document-oriented AI/transactional workloads. As enterprises modernize applications, flexible data models align more naturally with documents than relational schemas, and Postgres and MongoDB maybemorecomplementary in large architectures.                                   | Postgres continues to gain rapid adoption, and increased functionality with managed offerings reduce differentiation for MongoDB in early workload decisions. As Postgres ecosystems mature, some developers mayfavor familiar tooling over MongoDB's syntax and document model, and could prefer consolidating to platform offering that has Postgres.                            |
| Hyperscalers             | MongoDB's multi-cloud portability, neutral positioning, and growing marketplace presence enable organizations to avoid vendor lock-in and preserve architectural flexibility. Hyperscalers lack depth in document modeling and developer-centric tooling, leaving room for best-of-breed platforms.                                                                             | Hyperscalers continue to improve functionality and are tightly integrated with infrastructure, security, and AI services. These vendors can bundle databases at low incremental cost, threatening market potential                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Consumption- based Model | A usage-based model aligns revenue with value, and supports outsize expansion when workloads scale/new use cases. Telemetry-driven sales motion improves expansion targeting, and higher enterprise mix could provide more predictability.                                                                                                                                      | Consumption variability reduces near-term visibility and can create sharp quarterly swings. Optimization cycles, slower app usage growth, or elongated customer decisions mayamplify volatility.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Bulls point to the platform's role in consolidating operational, analytical, and AI workloads; the early, but expanding adoption of adjacent capabilities; a large Enterprise Advanced migration opportunity that can support multi-year Atlas growth. Bears emphasize the potential for hyperscaler bundling, Postgres 'good enough' dynamics, and near-term consumption variability to moderate growth or constrain multiple expansion. Taken together, we believe MongoDB's position as a unified developer data platform provides durable differentiation, but a premium valuation requires consistent execution and steady improvement in visibility. MongoDB trading at a premium versus the high-growth and Rule of 40-plus software group implies the durability of Atlas-driven expansion, increasing platform breadth, and a clear path toward improving operating leverage; however, consumption variability, intensifying competition, and evolving open-source alternatives could temper multiple expansion without AI/agentic-based use case growth.

These dynamics frame the broader context for MongoDB's platform that we believe is uniquely aligned with how modern applications and AI systems are being built. We view the company's architecture and adjacent capabilities as foundational to its long-term relevance as a differentiated database management platform.

We believe MongoDB's durable differentiation comes from its core as the leading document-based database platform being aligned with how modern applications are built and operated. This enables agility that traditional relational systems cannot match, supporting a spectrum of application/workload requirements from transactional systems to AI and real-time analytics. MongoDB is built for 'unstructured' data (PDFs, emails, etc.) requirements, important as the majority of data is unstructured (various estimates say 70-90%) and that data can be critical to realizing value from AI/agentic investments. We think MongoDB could be considered the bridge connecting AI/agentic functionality with enterprise data to power modern applications. As organizations look to converge operational/transactional with analytical data (and structured with unstructured) architectures for AI/agentic applications, we expect MongoDB's position at this intersection to strengthen.

We expect incremental adoption of capabilities beyond core database such as Vector Search, Atlas Stream Processing, and Queryable Encryption further entrench MongoDB's criticality for storage and toward analytics, AI, and event-driven applications. The platform importance is shown by two-thirds-plus of Atlas ARR coming from customers using at least one additional capability beyond core, and we think increasing diversification can provide growth sustainability. MongoDB's core document-based database organizes information as self-contained documents typically using JSON (or BSON, binary JSON) that encapsulates all related attributes within a single record. Alternatively, relational databases rely on storing data in rows and columns that can cause developers to have to stay within a predetermined schema for data or manage updating schema changes and the associated impacts that may occur. In document-based, each document mirrors how modern applications represent objects in code; this allows developers to map data structures directly into their applications without complex joins or schema design.

Document databases store variable, nested, and unstructured data natively versus relational databases requiring predefined schemas and strict normalization rules. This flexibility allows organizations to evolve data models dynamically as application requirements change instead of facing downtime or costly migrations. Developers can represent real-world entities (e.g., customers, orders, or transactions) in a single document rather than distributing them across multiple linked tables.

Source: MongoDB, Gartner, Raymond James research PostgreSQL is an open source database system that is object-relational and is a leading choice for developers according to Stack Overflow's 2024 Developer Survey. Its momentum is also shown by scaled database management vendors investing/acquiring Postgres functionality to offer within their platforms. Postges poses a threat as it has gradually added features once unique to document databases like support for semistructured JSON storage and flexible indexing. This enables developers to build modern, schema-flexible applications while still using relational/ SQL model syntax. Growth in serverless Postgres and cloud-managed versions could be closing Atlas' ease-of-use story and proliferating options for organizations.

MongoDB has advantages against this threat. Postgres still faces limitations in scaling horizontally across distributed clusters, handling very high write-throughput workloads, dealing with storage size limitations, and providing developer-native document flexibility. MongoDB's document model and sharding architecture provide advantages over these challenges. Furthermore, we think that MongoDB's tight integration with features like vector search and stream processing are key advantages for AI/agentic (and broader) environments, as these items are not native to Postgres.

MongoDB's managed cloud offering Atlas accounts for ~75% of revenue and is the key long-term growth driver. Atlas has a frictionless self-service model that creates a funnel for developers/new customers to initially use, and Atlas is used by over 95% of MongoDB customers. Atlas consumption ramps as customers gain incremental value and their applications scale. As organizations become more valuable, MongoDB helps nuture expansion via direct engagement (~15% of accounts are direct, with rest selfserve). While the large cloud providers can offer similar customer journeys, MongoDB enables multi-cloud and hybrid deployment to help organizations avoid hyperscaler lock-in, while providing scalability and data locality requirements. We think its Application Modernization Platform (AMP) and Relational Migrator solutions alleviate challenges in migrating to modern database architectures, and sharpening a focus on winning developer mind share earlier in the application design practice can continue driving new account adoption.

Enterprise migration from on-premises databases to cloud-native architectures should remain a durable secular tailwind. MongoDB's Enterprise Advanced is 20%-plus of subscription revenue, but non-Atlas accounts are less than 3% of total customers. The average revenue per Atlas customer is $25k per year, whereas Non-Atlas average/customer is nearing $400k. Non-Atlas accounts being ~15x larger on average has remained relatively consistent, and we think migrating these accounts with feature parity/innovation is a critical long-term growth driver. We believe some of MongoDB's largest accounts (which can have compliance restrictions) have relied on Enterprise Advanced for critical applications, and the potential eventual migration of those accounts to Atlas could provide durable tailwinds. While the company continues to innovate in Atlas and EA, we could see an eventual prioritization of cloud-based features or use pricing as levers to migrate important accounts.

With non-Atlas customers spending many times more, migrating even a small portion could meaningfully lift Atlas growth. We estimate migrating 5% of the non-Atlas accounts can yield about 200 bp of growth in period (which can then turn into further expansion with the consumption model). Atlas meets customers where they are going within the major hyperscalers, while being flexible to support hybrid/on-premises requirements too. The platform's portability and vendor neutrality can appeal to organizations seeking to avoid hyperscaler lock-in, while providing data residency and compliance flexibility. As enterprises re-platform mission-critical workloads and AI-driven applications to the cloud, MongoDB's distributed architecture and consumption-based pricing model position it to capture incremental workloads at scale.

MongoDB has a solid mix of growth at scale and improving profitability, and we have precedent for its longer-term targets that include 20%-plus Atlas growth with 20%-plus operating margin as it grows towards $5B-plus of ARR in the coming years. We compared MongoDB's three- to five-year targets to more scaled database related vendors, and found precedent for the ~$5B-plus Atlas target and total revenue expectations within the time frame. Using MongoDB's FY25 ~$2B revenue as a baseline in 'year -1', we compare the trajectories of Snowflake, Oracle, and SAP after achieving $2B. While not example comparable to MongoDB's business, these vendors do show the ability to scale to $5B-plus within a three-year period (though growth rates were higher coming into/out of year 0). Figure 8 - MongoDB's growth targets have precedent from other more scaled vendors Source: MongoDB, FactSet, Raymond James research

We think MongoDB is currently undergoing a transition to more balanced growth amid the AI investment cycle. Atlas maintaining 20%-plus growth will be critical for investor sentiment as overall growth can be pulled down by EA, and we could see risk to MDB commanding a premium to its overall growth comp group without improved margin/free cash flow generation like Rule of 40-plus, high-growth peers. Figure 9 - MongoDB's trajectory back to Rule of 40-plus status is more a more balanced growth and margin structure Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research Figure 10 - EV/Revenue vs Rule of 40 shows MDB above the trendline, with potential growth and margin overperformance justifying the premium Source: FactSet, VisibleAlpha, Raymond James research

MongoDB's financial model offers little visibility externally from RPO and/or deferred revenue due to the consumption nature of Atlas, and nonAtlas results can swing based on customer preference for multiyear commitments. The real-time nature of the model, and potential impact from non-Atlas, can create large reactions to MongoDB's financial performance and projection. Figure 11 - MongoDB's cRPO provides less visibility to revenue versus other high growth consumption models Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research We think MongoDB's sales model is aligned with customers' preferences and could turn into growth/margin expansion. We view Atlas' consumption bias as the correct model but could see an appreciation for visibility into Atlas expectations and from high-value, non-Atlas accounts. Better insight could alleviate potential swings investors have to stomach every 90 days.

MongoDB is a document-based database management system (i.e., non-relational or not structured with rows and columns) with its roots in serving transactional use cases (i.e., capturing events like orders). Organizations use a combination of relational and nonrelational DBMS tools for transactional and analytical data, and we expect the two major market areas to have less discrete swim lanes due to open standards innovation and AI systems requiring a convergence of transactional and analytical data.

We size MongoDB's TAM growing toward $140B in 2028 from $80B-plus in 2025 - a 17% CAGR driven by non-relational growing above 20% and relational in the low teens. Our estimated TAM is lower than MongoDB's stated $105B in 2025 but closer to its $150B in 2028. We believe building out analytical capabilities that blur the distinction between transactional/analytical DBMS and AI use cases will drive strong TAM expansion. If MongoDB was pigeonholed within non-relational use cases, the opportunity would be closer to $60B-plus in 2028 from $40B-plus in 2025. Figure 13 - We see ample opportunity for MongoDB, having only captured 2% of its $140B 2028 TAM Source: MongoDB, Gartner, Raymond James research

Our bottom-up estimate assumes half of the 30M developer opportunity use the Atlas Dedicated tier (M30 and above recommended for production) at around $400/month for a TAM of $70B-plus. We admit widely varying inputs can sway a developer-led TAM estimate, but can make reasonable assumptions to be in a similar sizing as the industry-based opportunity.

MongoDB is the leading non-relational DBMS that is not a cloud provider; its 7% non-relational DBMS market share trails Amazon's 40%-plus and Google's ~25% positions. We attribute MongoDB's rise to being a popular choice for developers needing/wanting to work with unstructured data (majority of data), while providing a solution with scalability and flexibility to deploy across the major hyperscale clouds or on-premises. A productled motion starting as free helps expand the potential customer funnel by offering a fully-managed database that allows developers to focus on their applications, while increased platform functionality and additional workload/expansion from existing accounts powers share gain. We do not expect MongoDB to have the top market share because hyperscale cloud providers' scale/bundling power if organizations lock into an ecosystem for various IT requirements. However, remaining a best-of-breed vendor that gives the ability to deploy MongoDB wherever organizations choose can provide durable advantages and incremental market share.

Figure 14 - MongoDB has the largest non-relational DBMS market share when excluding hyperscalers Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research MongoDB's share has been rising toward 2% of the entire DBMS market (relational and non-relational). We believe MongoDB can continue to gain overall share with non-relational use cases growing faster due to AI/agentic functionality requiring unstructured data expertise. As the company furthers relational/analytical capabilities to its core transactional solution, there could be more migration away from legacy share donors as well. Figure 15 - MongoDB has been a share gainer in the broader database management market Source: Gartner, Raymond James research

MongoDB's strong market position is also reflected with being a Leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems in 2022, 2023, and 2025 (the company did not participate prior to 2022). We believe its presence against much larger firms showcases strong technology and developer adoption. As MongoDB moves to scale against larger vendors, we think these rankings are important for recognition and help organizations potentially try JFrog against brands with larger budgets or sales/marketing engines. Figure 16 - MongoDB has a leadership position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems (2022, 2023, 2024) Source: Gartner, Raymond James research

MongoDB's core differentiation is being a document-based architecture that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents versus rigid relational tables (example below). This structure is aligned with modern application building and enables developers to build/iterate faster without needing to focus on staying within predefined schemas (or updating schemas as required). As organizations modernize data infrastructure/apps for cloud/AI era, MongoDB's schema flexibility and support for semi-structured and unstructured data can be critical for organization's software development/iteration and associated application performance and scalability. Figure 17 - Example of MongoDB's document-based approach vs. relational approach

Source: Raymond James research MongoDB is developer-centric , with its document-based approach and having an open-source community that drives word-of-mouth adoption. We believe having products more aligned with how developers code/operate versus requiring developers to use legacy methods for modern applications created the initial wave of demand. Its MongoDB Community Edition is a source-available, free-to-use version that can drive experimental and familiarity with the company's offerings. We think the company's developer-first motion has created strong demand via wordof-mouth; this can turn into durable cohort expansion as applications mature and require enterprises grade features.

MongoDB was built for AI requirements by being a native JSON database (Java Script Object Notation is a human-readable data format to structure/exchange information between apps). Being JSON native gives a structural advantage as AI applications can require unstructured/semistructured data to make decisions, and JSON has become the de facto standard for data interchange in AI/ML workflows used by APIs, model outputs, and orchestration frameworks. MongoDB's document model aligns with this standardization by allowing developers to ingest, store, and query model inputs and outputs without transformation complexity.

More recent features such as Atlas Search and Vector Search extend the architectural advantage by unifying transactional and semantic (understand meaning/context of data) workloads in a single system. Developers can store embeddings (numerical representations of text, images, or other unstructured data) alongside operational data, enabling AI-driven use cases (e.g., recommendation engines, retrieval-augmented generation, and contextual search). This can simplify the IT architecture and accelerate the development of AI-enabled applications by alleviating the challenges of external vector databases and data pipeline management.

MongoDB is akin to Switzerland by alleviating vendor lock-in concerns. The company has a neutral and interoperable architecture, allowing developers to deploy MongoDB across customers' preferred hyperscale cloud provider, private clouds, and/or on-premises. We think MongoDB's approach of portability and multi-cloud flexibility is appealing to enterprises looking to avoid being tied to a single hyperscaler. Its unified data model supports a wide range of workloads while maintaining consistent APIs and performance across the various environments customers use MongoDB.

| trade_id   | type   | symbol   |   quantity |   price |
|------------|--------|----------|------------|---------|
| t1001      | Stock  | ABC      |        100 |   85.25 |
|            | Bond   | XYZ2028  |         10 |  101.5  |

Recent investments in data streaming and real-time processing broaden its functionality and addressable use cases. MongoDB Stream Processing enables developers to ingest, transform, and react to data in motion using the same query language and interface used for operational data. This helps enable event-driven architectures and real-time analytics, extending MongoDB's role beyond storage into continuous data flow and application intelligence.

MongoDB also differentiates through security and enterprise-grade capabilities . Queryable Encryption enables data to remain encrypted even during query execution. We think this helps MongoDB's position for organizations adopting zero-trust architectures and compliance requirements, while showcases the company's innovation in privacy-preserving data management. Enterprises features also include Atlas Data Federation (unify queries across various data sources), Time Series collections (track data that changes over time), uptime guarantees, backup/recovery, and serverless deployment options (scales with workload demand), MongoDB offers a breadth and depth of functionality that few modern databases can match.

Document-based databases align with the modern application stack and enable faster development, scaling for application needs, and provide the necessary functionality to embrace AI/agentic capabilities. They are increasingly preferred for use cases that demand agility and continuous data evolution, from e-commerce/IoT (tried and true) to recommendation engines/generative AI (proven in use cases that we expect to proliferate).

Document-based databases' flexible, developer-oriented model are a fundamental shift from traditional relational databases' rigid, table-driven structure. MongoDB's core document-based database organizes information as self-contained documents typically using JSON (or BSON, binary JSON) that encapsulates all related attributes within a single record. Alternatively, relational databases rely on storing data in rows and columns that can cause developers to have to stay within a predetermined schema for data or manage updating schema changes and the associated impacts that may occur. In document-based, each document mirrors how modern applications represent objects in code; this allows developers to map data structures directly into their applications without complex joins or schema design. Document databases store variable, nested, and unstructured data natively versus relational databases requiring predefined schemas and strict normalization rules.

This flexibility allows organizations to evolve data models dynamically as application requirements change instead of facing downtime or costly migrations. Developers can represent real-world entities (e.g., customers, orders, or transactions) in a single document rather than distributing them across multiple linked tables.

● Schema flexibility and developer productivity: Since data is stored in a structure that mirrors application objects, development cycles can be shorter and easier to maintain. Developers being able to adapt the data model in real time can accelerate development and feature iteration/ fixes. ● Performance for modern apps: By keeping related data together, there is a reduced need for 'joins', which improves query performance and reduces latency. ● Native JSON support: JSON has become the standard language of web APIs and AI data communication. By storing this format natively, integration across applications and models is simplified. ● Horizontal scalability: Due to being designed for distributed architectures, document-based scale seamlessly across clusters and make them well-suited for cloud and global workloads (i.e., for enterprises as applications scale).

● Analytical needs: While document databases excel at operational workloads, they are less efficient for complex joins or multi-document transactions often found in traditional analytics. ● Less mature ecosystem and learning curve: Organizations heavily invested in SQL-based tools may face integration challenges or require skill set transitions with the adoption of MongoDB/document-based solutions. ● Data integrity/standardization: Due to not having a rigid, predefined schema for data, there can be challenges with data integrity (accurate, complete) and interoperability between various database systems. While we compare/contract document-based versus relational database technologies, we note most organizations will use a combination of these solutions due to inherent advantages to particular use cases.

MongoDB's document-based database is considered a non-relational database technology. Other non-relational alternatives include key value, wide column, time series, and graph.

With document-based importance to AI/agentic, we expect it to become a higher portion due to outpacing the growth seen by alternatives. Nonetheless, we see key-value, document, and wide-column garnering IT budget attention due to the follow reasons:

● Document-based databases (e.g., MongoDB) strike the balance between flexibility, expressiveness, and scalability. This makes them ideal for application data, content management, and AI-driven systems. ● Key-value databases deliver strong performance for high-speed, low-latency workloads, where simplicity and availability outweigh structure. These are commonly used for caching layers and ephemeral data. ● Wide-column databases specialize in high-volume, analytical, and time-series workloads that provide massive horizontal scale but require greater operational tuning. Figure 21 - Expect document-based technology to become an increasingly larger portion of NRDBMS' mix Source: Gartner, Raymond James research

MongoDB's 2025 investor day highlighted the importance of MongoDB's differentiation vs Postgres, with management directly confronting the concern that 'Postgres is emerging as a standard instead of MongoDB.' PostgreSQL is an open source database system that is object-relational and is a leading choice for developers according to Stack Overflow's 2024 Developer Survey. It has gained widespread adoption among developers through strong community support, ability to handle both structured and semi-structured data (via JSONB), and compatibility with major cloud platforms. The combination of open-source flexibility and enterprisegrade reliability has made it a compelling choice for startups and enterprises seeking to avoid proprietary licensing costs.

Other database providers have heavily invested in and/or purchased managed Postgres offerings or functionality to capture workloads migrating from on-prem relational systems to the cloud. These providers adding Postgres functionality is due to Postgres' developer mindshare and becoming a well understood language, and it is increasingly used as the foundation for new applications that historically would have gone to used legacy methods. Postgres poses a threat as it has gradually added features once unique to document databases like support for semi-structured JSON storage and flexible indexing. This enables developers to build modern, schema-flexible applications while still using relational/SQL model syntax. Growth in serverless Postgres and cloud-managed versions could close in on Atlas' ease-of-use story and proliferating options for organizations.

MongoDB has advantages against this threat. Postgres still faces limitations in scaling horizontally across distributed clusters, handling very high write-throughput workloads, dealing with storage size limitations, and providing developer-native document flexibility. MongoDB's document model and sharding architecture provide advantages over these challenges. Furthermore, we think that MongoDB's tight integration with features like vector search and stream processing are key advantages for AI/agentic (and broader) environments as these items are not native to Postgres.

While Postgres has extensions/mechanisms to makeup for some shortcomings, this makes the argument against MongoDB like a suite of required discrete technologies working together versus MongoDB's holistic solution. That said, we believe there is a growing overlap between Postgres and MongoDB as part of a broader convergence of database technologies (e.g., relational and non-relational systems borrowing each other's strengths). As organizations increasingly strive for unified/holistic data platforms that can handle both transactional and analytical workloads across structured/unstructured data, distinctions between particular database 'types' are blurring. Postgres's evolution into a semi-structured and cloud-native system highlights this convergence, while MongoDB's SQL interoperability shows this trend in reverse.

This convergence is particularly important for AI and agentic systems, which require databases capable of handling both structured and unstructured data, embeddings, and contextual search. MongoDB's document and vector capabilities align more naturally with these workloads, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings or conversational context (whereas Postgres was not originally designed for this). We think MongoDB and Postgres will both shape how AI-native applications are built and showcased the importance of MongoDB winning mindshare of developers in this next phase of growth.

MongoDB Atlas is the company's fully managed cloud database platform offered as a service. It was introduced in 2016. Atlas automates provisioning, scaling, backing up, and performance optimization across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud (which can be concurrently). This allows organizations to offload the operational burden of managing database infrastructure to MongoDB. The consumption-based model lets customers start small and scale seamlessly as workloads expand. Atlas has evolved into a complete data platform with features like search, vector storage, stream processing, and analytics via a unified interface. This consolidation allows enterprises to run operational and AI workloads without managing multiple point solutions. We believe the platform can create a flywheel effect by using MongoDB in app creation, which then drives more data and users, which can then be made to make new/iterate apps with more data and features via MongoDB.

MongoDB Enterprise Advanced (EA), introduced in 2013, provides customers with an on-premises, cloud, or hybrid deployment option featuring advanced security, compliance, monitoring, and support. EA is largely used by regulated industries and large enterprises with strict data governance or latency requirements . MongoDB Community Edition is a free, source-available version that serves as a developer acquisition funnel; it was introduced in 2009. The open model can drive grassroots adoption, and then EA monetizes maturing workloads that require enterprise-grade capabilities; we think this ensures MongoDB stays alongside customers as they scale from application inception to production.

MongoDB's document-based database architecture stores data in flexible, JSON-like structures (BSON) that enables developers to use data in a way that mirrors application objects. The core technology is meant for unstructured data (i.e., majority of data created, which could be PDFs, business files, emails, social media, etc.) and is aligned with requirements for AI/agentic systems . The schema flexibility can create faster iteration, fewer migrations, and easier scaling compared to relational databases. The core database underpins all MongoDB services and supports a wide range of workloads (e.g., transactional, time-series, analytics, AI inference) within a single platform. Its built-in replication, sharding, and horizontal scaling make it highly resilient and performant in distributed environments. We highlight key features MongoDB has released in addition to its database that amplify the importance of 70% of Atlas ARR coming from customers using at least one additional functionality beyond core data.

Search gives developers a more simplistic path of adding search functionality to applications. It integrates full-text search capabilities directly within the Atlas database, which alleviates the complexity of maintaining a separate search engine alongside the database. Search supports rich text indexing, relevance scoring, autocomplete, and synonym matching MongoDB's standard query interface. This integration enables use cases such as product discovery, content search, and AI-driven semantic retrieval with minimal overhead or data duplication required from using a thirdparty search engine. Figure 22 - Atlas Search enables users to query data for results/insights

Vector Search provides users with the ability to use their own data with pre-trained AI foundational models for AI/agentic purposes. This extended MongoDB's native data model to support embeddings (numerical versions of unstructured data like text, images, or audio). Developers can create semantic similarity queries directly in the database that enables retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), recommendation systems, and contextual search functionality expected in AI experiences. We think MongoDB unifying structured, unstructured, and vector data in a single platform is a key differentiation that simplifies architectures and reduces latency in AI-driven applications. Figure 23 - Vector Search providing embedding function required for AI/agentic purposes within MongoDB platform

Stream Processing enables real-time ingestion, transformation, and analysis of data in motion using MongoDB's familiar query language. This feature allows developers to react to events (e.g., transactions, IoT signals, customer personalization/interactions) as they occur through simplified Apache Kafka integration. The integration with the Atlas platform can lower the complexity of managing data pipelines and helps position MongoDB for event-driven application actions. Figure 24 - Real-time event being processed within MongoDB

Application Modernization Platform (AMP) and Relational Migrator help simplify the transition from legacy databases to MongoDB . AMP is MongoDB's AI-powered solution that provides uses automation to hasten analyzing, generating tests, converting code, validating changes, and then deploying/migrating from incumbent solutions. Relational Migrator is a free tool that helps automate schema conversion and data movement from legacy relational systems. We think these tools help MongoDB's initial and expansion sales efforts by reducing migration friction that typically inhibits enterprises seeking to modernize legacy workloads. Figure 25 - AMP using AI/automation to speed up app/data system modernization Source: MongoDB

Compass is a graphical user interface that allows developers and data teams to explore, query, and optimize databases via a visual interface . It provides schema visualization, performance metrics, and index (query performant data structure) recommendations. We think this can help expand the usage of MongoDB by making data exploration more intuitive versus requiring complex coding capabilities. Compass allows users to refine application behavior directly within the database, which can improve development iteration and provide better governance on data without requiring various systems. Figure 26 - Compass providing a visual interface to simplify data operations

Queryable Encryption allows sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) or financial records to remain encrypted even during query execution. Unlike traditional encryption methods that require decryption before querying, this ensures data always remains confidential . By doing so, MongoDB assists teams achieving/remaining withing stringent compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP) without sacrificing performance or usability.

Time Series helps capture data over time for purposes such as IoT telemetry, financial data, operational metrics, and application logs. These collections are meant to efficiently handle large volumes of data via compression/bucketing to reduce cost and improve query speed for sequential/temporal data. Developers can analyze trends, find issues, or trigger alerts without needing an additional specialized time-series database . This broadens MongoDB's use cases beyond core database into real-time monitoring, observability, and sensor-driven applications.

MongoDB's built-in data visualization and analytics tool that helps turn live data into interactive dashboards without needing to export to external business intelligence software. Charts allows users to visualize trends, watch key metrics, and share insights directly from real-time application data. Since data does not need to be extracted or transformed, this can lower latency and simplify the analytics workflow. As with other capabilities, we think this broadens MongoDB beyond just storing data and into a complete operational intelligence platform used for developers and business teams. Figure 27 - Atlas Charts enable users to dissect data trends within the MongoDB platform

MongoDB's partner ecosystem catalog has technology integrations that allow developers to focus on software creation/features instead of managing the connections between various tools. These integrations (e.g., cloud services, developer tools, analytics) can amplify MongoDB's position as a central component of an organization's modern application ecosystem. We think this helps MongoDB reduce friction between operational and analytical systems, allowing organizations to unify data workflows across applications, streams, and AI environments. In turn, organizations can have faster development cycles via tight alignment between MongoDB and the broader development/IT ecosystem.

This is a distributed query engine that enables users to query/transform/move data across multiple sources within and outside of Atlas . We think this supports MongoDB's neutrality by giving a holistic way to query/combine data across various sources (e.g., hyperscalers or other data lakes). Data Federation allows teams to analyze current and archived data without moving or transforming it, eliminating silos and reducing data duplication. We believe this helps positions MongoDB beyond just being a database, but a data access layer for hybrid and multi-cloud analytics strategies. Figure 28 - Atlas Data Federation enables data to be reformatted into cloud storage for analyzation with existing tools used by organizations Source: MongoDB

MongoDB's GTM strategy has evolved from solely a product and developer-led sales approach into a multi-channel, hybrid motion to generate and capture demand across start-ups to enterprises. Its Community Edition gives a product-led motion for developers to trial out MongoDB riskfree and creates a potential pool of organizations to convert to paid users. MongoDB's direct-sales motion that helps land and expand use cases/ spending is being buttressed by a growing partner ecosystem.

MongoDB's adoption starts with developers. Atlas offers an always-free tier, frictionless sign-up, and instant provisioning across hyperscalers. We think this product-led growth motion has driven MongoDB's adoption as developers can build, deploy, and test workloads without procurement cycles or sales involvement. Importantly, this motion continues to drive awareness/adoption and expansion into high spending accounts (e.g. track Atlas usage habits to promote customer importance, etc.), as mentioned at MongoDB's Sept. 2025 investor day:

● MongoDB's self-serve channel accounts for hundreds of thousands of sign-ups each quarter. ● Roughly 80% of new Atlas developers identify as new to MongoDB, showing it remains a primary on-ramp for new users. ● Many workloads begin at minimal consumption levels and expand organically into revenue as projects move from test to production. ● About 25% of MongoDB's $1M-plus customers began via self-serve and those typically reach the milestone 15% faster than accounts sourced through traditional sales. With rapidly changing skill sets and a flood of AI-native upstarts, we think MongoDB is wisely focusing marketing into the Silicon Valley area to drive awareness of MongoDB while also continuing to go after relational developers and drive up-skilling activity to drive expansion.

As MongoDB's product matured and feature set expanded to handle enterprise demands, the GTM motion expanded upmarket. Management has deliberately shifted sales capacity toward larger enterprises and strategic workloads, with quotas around revenue/ARR versus previously looking to grow workload volume. Informed by usage telemetry about which organizations are most likely to expand, we believe the direct motion can provide stickiness due the focus being on workloads in regulated or mission-critical environments, AI/agentic workloads, and then modernization projects that help unlock teams from legacy solutions.

MongoDB's ecosystem strategy aims to meet (potential) customers wherever they build and run applications. For the CSPs and their marketplaces, Atlas runs natively on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud with over 120 regional footprints. Customers can deploy clusters directly through cloud marketplaces, apply existing cloud commitments, and integrate with native services. We think this reduces procurement friction and strengthens co-sell relationships. Beyond cloud providers, GSI/partnerships can extend MongoDB into large digital-transformation programs and solidify its strategic importance to enterprises; we expect this to continue becoming a larger portion of mix as MongoDB scales.

The following charts show the split of direct customers to self-serve accounts as number of organizations and subscription revenue. We also show the average subs revenue per direct and self-service account. Direct accounts represent low double-digits of MongoDB's number of customers, but the proportion of Subs revenue is nearing 90%. On an average basis, direct customers pay $225k-plus per year (and has steadily grown) whereas self-service is closer to $5k (and has been relatively stagnant). Figure 29 - Direct customers are less than 15% of total accounts, with self-serve customers creating a funnel for potential future growth Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research Figure 30 - Direct customers are nearly 90% of total Subs, showing MongoDB's ability to nuture high-value accounts as they expand from self-service/initial use cases Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

Figure 31 - The average spend of direct customers is over 45x higher than self-serve, and direct customers' average spend has steadily increased Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

Pricing is based on the hourly consumption of resources (e.g., storage, memory, compute, throughout), rather than paying for a number of license seats or cores. We believe this is aligns with MongoDB's desire to show value to customers, and increased value drives move consumption. Self-serve Atlas customers are charged monthly in arrears based on usage; Atlas customers with sales relationship typically sign annual contracts and pay in advance or invoiced monthly in arrears based on usage. Due to not requiring an upfront commitment, the company expects to have higher portion of Atlas contracts billed monthly in arrears. Atlas customers have the option of Dedicated or Flex (as well as Free) versions. Dedicated is for production applications and offers Cluster Tiers for storage/compute requirements (and MongoDB offers specialized configurations) and pricing options across the hyperscalers. Flex is meant for application development/testing, and the tiers are based on operations/second required.

Enterprise Advanced is typically sold on annual or multi-year subscription terms for access to MongoDB for on-premises or private cloud usage. There is no list pricing due to being negotiated per account. The majority of EA revenue is from post-contract customer support (PCS) support and maintenance and the rest is upfront license costs.

MongoDB generates revenue from consulting and training programs, with different support tiers.

Functions on top of core database are sold as add-ons (e.g., Search, Vector Search, Stream Processing charged on hourly basis or amount of data moved for Stream Processing, Data Federation) or provided as a carrot to move to higher cost product tier (e.g, Charts with full functionality in Dedicated).

MongoDB has amassed nearly 60k accounts with steady yearly adds. Total account growth has decelerated with scale, but we think the company still has ample new account potential coming from GTM efforts around driving self-serve accounts and migrating larger accounts via direct sales. Figure 34 - MongoDB has amassed nearly 60k accounts and has ample new account opportunity via it self serve GTM motion Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

We think $100k-plus and $1M-plus ARR account expansion shows MongoDB becoming more strategic by moving upmarket and expanding its enterprise footprint. Average revenue in the $100k-plus and $1M-plus cohorts has also seen a strong increase, with $100k-plus average ARR growing 2x and $1M-plus 1.85x from FY22 to 1HF26, per the 2025 analyst day. We believe this indicates GTM efforts to focus on quality workloads with penchant to expand and application modernization/migration efforts are working. Further, we think the product road map has been aligned with enterprise requirements, indicated by 70% of Atlas ARR coming from customers using at least one additional capability beyond core. Figure 35 - Higher value accounts are growing at a faster pace than the overall customer base, and still strongly expanding upon hitting the higher value thresholds Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

MongoDB can continue to expand its customer base through developer-led adoption and enterprise application/database modernization initiatives. The company's open-source roots and free version can drive top-of-funnel adoption, and integrations with GitHub, VS Code, Vercel, and cloud marketplaces make MongoDB an easily discoverable and developer-friendly platform. While 62.5k-plus accounts is a sizable start, we believe it could be multiples higher with product feature, market education, and word of mouth. Incubating AI natives provides a strong near-term proposition, and we see migration/modernization programs as drivers to land accounts that have already scaled beyond startup status.

MongoDB's platform breadth enables customers to grow beyond core database usage and drive expansion revenue. We think its strategic importance has risen well beyond a database for enterprises, with 70%-plus of Atlas revenue now comes from customers using at least one adjacent capability (e.g., Atlas Search, Vector Search, Charts, or Stream Processing). These integrated services allow customers to consolidate operational, analytical, and AI workloads under a single data platform to reduce architectural complexity and cost. As organizations standardize on MongoDB, we see a flywheel effect as additional workloads drive new applications, which creates feature upsell and spending expansion .

The company's net ARR expansion rate has been disclosed at 120%-plus from its IPO until F1Q25. The net ARR expansion rate dipped into the high-teen range afterward, but still remains in elite territory. While gross retention values are not provided, we estimate a mid-90%s range gross retention due to the stickiness of their products offset somewhat by many smaller teams that could churn faster. Figure 36 - MongoDB's expansion rate remains in elite territory, and we estimate a very-strong gross retention in the mid-90% range Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

Enterprise migration from on-premises databases to cloud-native architectures should remain a durable secular tailwind. Enterprise Advanced is 20%-plus of subscription revenue, but non-Atlas accounts are less than 3% of total customers. The average revenue per Atlas customer is $25k per year, whereas Non-Atlas average/customer is nearing $400k. Non-Atlas accounts being ~15x larger on average has remained relatively consistent, and we think migrating these accounts with feature parity/innovation is a critical long-term growth driver. We believe some of MongoDB's largest accounts (which can have compliance restrictions) have relied on Enterprise Advanced for critical applications, and the potential eventual migration of those accounts to Atlas could provide durable tailwinds. While the company continues to innovate in Atlas and EA, we could see an eventual prioritization of cloud-based features or use pricing as levers to migrate important accounts.

Atlas meets customers where they are going within the major hyperscalers, while being flexible to support hybrid/on-premises requirements too. The platform's portability and vendor neutrality can appeal to organizations seeking to avoid hyperscaler lock-in, while providing data residency and compliance flexibility. As enterprises replatform mission-critical workloads and AI-driven applications to the cloud, MongoDB's distributed architecture and consumption-based pricing model position it to capture incremental workloads at scale. Figure 37 - Atlas represents high-90% of MongoDB's customers, and still gaining new accounts in the double-digit range y/y Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research Figure 38 - The Atlas versus Enterprise Advanced split shows the more concentration of larger value accounts in Enterprise Advanced that can represent a sizable Atlas opportunity with migration/hybrid approach Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research Figure 39 - The average non-Atlas customer revenue is nearly $400k versus average Atlas customer around $25k Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

AI can represent a structural growth opportunity for MongoDB. We believe being able to offer a holistic platform versus managing multiple solutions could be the key differentiator. Having a native JSON architecture for unstructured data for AI/agentic requirements with Search/Vector Search capabilities and embedding functionality enables developers to unify structured and unstructured data for semantic similarity search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Embedding functionality essentially enables the use of internal private data with LLMs/foundational models by converting the data into vectors. MongoDB can also rerank results to improve output accuracy; the acquisition of Voyage AI's embedding and re-ranking models has expanded MongoDB to further act as the memory and state for autonomous agents. We believe that as AI/agentic applications mature into enterprise solutions, MongoDB's ability to consolidate transactional and semantic workloads in one system can offer performance benefits and architectural simplicity for organizations.

We think working to convert relational developers via migration programs is an important long-term growth driver considering half of the company's TAM is replacing Java applications running on Oracle . AMP and Relational Migrator simplify the process of refactoring applications written for legacy or growing alternatives like Oracle, SQL Server, or Postgres. We think these initiatives provide MongoDB the opportunity to show differentiation in modernization/AI requirements faced by developer/IT teams and unlock a vast install base of legacy systems facing cost, scalability, and data flexibility challenges.

AMP's AI-assisted assisted code refactoring, static analysis, and testing automation can reduce risk associated with large-scale modernization projects and accelerate MongoDB deployment. We think this can make MongoDB a more strategic IT partner to organizations, as unlocking migrations of critical applications should make its solutions stickier. Relational Migrator, a free tool that helps automate schema conversion and data movement from legacy relational systems, should also help the broader potential customer base with migrating. We think these tools help MongoDB's initial/expansion sales efforts by reducing migration friction that inhibits organizations seeking to modernize legacy workloads.

MongoDB is increasingly tailoring platform use cases toward high-value verticals such as financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing. These industries have various data types and demand scalability, compliance, and data privacy; features like Queryable Encryption and multi-region replication can provide an advantage. Vertical-specific playbooks and reference architectures can accelerate adoption by addressing industryspecific challenges MongoDB has learned from existing accounts, like capabilities for fraud detection, patient data management, or supply chain traceability. We think proliferating/sharpening the vertical focus allows MongoDB to deepen enterprise penetration and establish repeatable blueprints for high-value workloads.

During its 2025 investor day, management provided longer-term financial targets (3-5 years) that included average revenue growth in the highteens, achieving 20%-plus operating margin in the time frame, and 80%-plus free cash flow conversion. Drivers include Atlas growing at least 20%plus y/y (framed as explicitly not a ceiling, and growth could be in the 30% range), with an average annual operating margin expansion of 100-200 bps, and improving the operating income to free cash flow conversion. Non-Atlas is expected to stay within the low- to mid-single-digit growth range for the foreseeable future. Our analysis of the longer-term growth targets are not future RJ estimates, but a combination of consensus estimates and a gradual deceleration for later years within the three- to five-year time frame.

In taking a conservative path toward 20% Atlas growth, HSD Services expansion, and Other Subscription remaining in the LSD, MongoDB total revenue would more than double. Total revenue in FY31E would be $5.5B-plus (up 128% from FY26E, 18% five-year CAGR), with Atlas growing 170%-plus to $4.8B with a 22% five-year CAGR. Figure 40 - MongoDB's longer-term growth framework is powered by Atlas' 20%+ y/y growth Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

We compared MongoDB's three- to five-year targets to more scaled database related vendors, and found precedent for the ~$5B-plus Atlas target and total revenue expectations within the time frame. Using MongoDB's FY25 ~$2B revenue as a baseline in 'year -1', we compare the trajectories of Snowflake, Oracle, and SAP after achieving $2B. While not perfectly comparable to MongoDB's business, these vendors do show the ability to scale to $5B-plus within a three-year period (though growth rates were higher coming into/out of year 0). Note: 'Year 0' represents when MongoDB provided the three-to five-year target, and a 17% y/y growth rate is used in +1, +2, and +3 years; SNOW +2 represents consensus values for its FY26. Figure 41 - MongoDB's growth targets have precedent from other more scaled vendors Source: MongoDB, FactSet, Raymond James research

From a margin perspective, management plans to expand from 15% operating margin in FY25 to 20%-plus operating margin with and average yearly 100-200bps operating margin expansion in three to five years. Assuming no gross margin expansion (that should occur with scale efficiencies), sales and marketing represents the biggest lever for incremental margin improvement y/y. Assuming on the low end of 100 bps of average expansion, MongoDB should achieve the 20%-plus operating margin on schedule, while providing ample flexibility to invest into growth initiatives. Figure 42 - MongoDB's three- to five-year operating margin target provides plenty flexibility for investing with margin expansion Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

The long-term targets also include getting free cash flow conversion to 80%-plus (operating income to free cash flow). Free cash flow is not expected to exceed operating income (on longer-basis) due to MongoDB having limited deferred revenue in a largely consumption-based business. This means customers consume products, MongoDB then bills, and subsequently collects payment. Maturing practices around billing/collections and managing partners should continue to improve this conversion. Figure 43 - FCF conversion (as percentage of operating income) has improved and shown variabiltiy based on collections, with a longterm target of 80-100% conversion Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research Stock-based compensation will continue being important, but management has a goal of keeping the share count flattish via share repurchases. SBC is currently in the mid 20% range of revenue within FY26, down from 30%-plus three years prior. We expect a gradual decrease in coming years.

We use customer lifetime value-to-customer acquisition cost (LTV/CAC) to look at sales and marketing efficiency. Although LTV/CAC has been declining (we estimate gross retention and lifetime considering trends with DBNRR), the ratio still indicates the company could flex into investing for customers. We think the self-serve and product-led motion help bring customers into the MongoDB ecosystem, and previous upfront/ongoing costs to service large customers are yielding efficient economics when looking at the total lifetime of the account. Figure 44 - MongoDB's LTV/CAC showcases strong customer lifetime value per investment, with room to further invest for growth Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

MongoDB's free cash flow margin has showed steady expansion (especially seen in TTM basis). With the 20%-plus operating margin and 80%-plus conversion targets, we expect free cash flow indicating towards the high-teens range in the next three to five years. Figure 45 - MongoDB's free cash flow margin has shown steady expansion Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research The Rule of 40 used to benchmark software companies considers the year-over-year revenue growth rate plus a margin metric. MongoDB has historically relied upon revenue growth to surpass the benchmark, but is now becoming a more balanced mix of growth and margin. We find more recent trends under the bar related to macro impacts, but find longer-term targets implying an upwards trajectory toward/above the Rule of 40 behind growth drivers and margin levers detailed previously. Figure 46 - MongoDB's Rule of 40 profile is becoming more balanced as the company matures Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

MongoDB has ~$2.3B of cash/equivalents with no debt as of October 2025. Management is managing share count via share repurchases and cash settlement of RSU/PSU taxes, with a plan to keep share count relatively stable. M&A has been used for tuck-in technological capabilities and expansion into adjacent markets related its core. Recent notable examples such as Voyage AI provided MongoDB with AI embedding and re-ranking functionality, and Granite added the ability to take process on data streaming. We expect tuck-ins to remain the key M&A focus, anchored by a strong balance sheet and improving cash generation.

Figure 47 - MongoDB's acquisitions have focused on tuck-ins that provide incremental technological capabilities to add to the platform

Our model assumed MongoDB will generate $3.4B of revenue in FY28 for a three-year CAGR of 19%. We expect Atlas to become 80% of sales in FY28, with a 24% segment revenue CAGR, while Other subscriptions become 18% of sales with 4% sales CAGR. We anticipate the customer count to grow toward 85k in FY28 from 55k in FY25, with gross retention stable in the mid-90% range, and for DBNRR to be in the mid-teens to low-20% range. We expect expansion to be driven by cloud migration (especially of higher value accounts), up/cross-selling of additional product on top of core database, and AI use cases. We see Atlas accounts growing from 53k at the end of FY25 to beyond 80k in FY28

We expect direct customers to increase modestly from FY25A to FY28E; after a dip in FY2026E to prioritize higher value accounts, we expect additional sales/channel coverage to support nurturing accounts directly and growing these higher spending organizations. We model Subs revenue per direct to expand from about $225k in FY25 toward $400k in FY28, while Subs revenue per self-service account stays in the $5k range over the forecast period. Figure 48 - We expect high-teens overall growth powered by low-/mid-20% range Atlas growth through FY28 Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research We model gross margin remaining around 75% in the forecast, with marginal overall improvement coming from Atlas and newer product functionalities gaining scale efficiencies.

Sales and marketing could provide the most leverage, in our view, with S&M declining toward 30% of sales in FY28 from 35% in FY25 but increasing by nearly 50% on a dollar basis over that time. We model R&D remaining flattish around 17% of revenue in FY28, as it was in FY25, but with the expense increasing by over 60%. We expect G&A to remain relatively consistent around 7% of FY28 sales from 8% in FY25. We model operating margin reaching 19%, with an FCF margin of 17% in FY28, up from 15% and 6% in FY25, respectively. Figure 49 - We model mid-70% range gross margin, with operating and free cash flow margin seeing leverage from S&M efficiencies Source: MongoDB, Raymond James research

We compare MDB against high-growth and database/adjacent-related software firms to assess its valuation. We also performed a discounted cash flow analysis to view MDB's valuation from another viewpoint.

We assign MDB a Moderately Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (MA/ACC) suitability rating, as MongoDB competes in a growing market with rapidly changing dynamics.

MongoDB operates in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving database market against legacy and modern database specialists, hyperscaler cloud providers, and emerging open-source or niche providers. These competitors can have deep customer relationships, strong brand equity, and the ability to bundle database services with adjacent offerings. As MongoDB expands its product portfolio and generative AI capabilities, intensifying competition from both established platforms and cloud providers could seek to capture developer workloads.

MongoDB's business model relies on renewing and expanding customer usage, particularly within MongoDB Atlas, which accounts for the majority of sales. The usage-based model can result in volatile revenue trends and reduce visibility as consumption levels can fluctuate with macro and workload dynamics. MongoDB's purposeful push toward enterprise accounts could have a lengthier sales cycles and higher customer acquisition costs that could offset efficiency gains in its land-and-expand motion.

MongoDB can increasingly expand its indirect sales motion through global system integrators, value-added resellers, and independent software vendors alongside its direct enterprise sales force. While this model enhances reach and scalability, it also introduces dependency on partner engagement and execution. Channel partners may prioritize competing offerings or fail to effectively market MongoDB's products, which could slow deal velocity or compress margins. Sustained growth can require MongoDB to balance its channel expansion with direct-sales investment and maintain alignment across partners to preserve sales efficiency and customer experience.

MongoDB competes directly with open source and do-it-yourself database solutions that provide free or low-cost alternatives to its managed offerings. Developers and enterprises may opt for these solutions in environments with budget constraints or in-house technical capability. This dynamic can slow conversion to paid Atlas tiers and limit demand. Sustaining growth can require MongoDB to clearly articulate the performance, scalability, and operational efficiency benefits of its commercial platform versus community or internally managed alternatives.

Moderate Risk/Provide Income (M/INC) Larger capitalization, lower volatility (beta) equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings, and dividend yields meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. Many securities in this category are structured with a focus on providing a consistent dividend or return of capital. Moderate Risk/Wealth Accumulation (M/ACC) Larger capitalization equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings growth, the potential for long-term price appreciation, and often a dividend yield. Moderately Aggressive Risk/ Provide Income (MA/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a dividend meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. These companies typically feature sound financials, positive earnings, and the potential for long-term price appreciation. Moderately Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (MA/ACC) Generally equities of companies in fast growing and competitive industries with less predictable earnings (or losses), potentially more

leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, and potential risk of principal. Aggressive Risk/Provide Income (A/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a meaningful dividend but may face less predictable earnings (or losses), more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, financial and competitive issues, higher price volatility (beta), and meaningful risk of loss of principal. Securities of companies in this category may have a more volatile income stream from dividends or distributions of capital. Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) Generally equities of companies with a short or unprofitable operating history, limited or less predictable revenues, high risk associated with success, high volatility (beta), potential significant financial or legal issues, and the meaningful risk of loss of principal.

RJL has developed a proprietary algorithm for risk rating individual securities. The algorithm utilizes data from multiple vendors, and all data is refreshed at least monthly. Accordingly, suitability ratings are updated monthly. The suitability rating shown on this report is current as of the report's published date. In the event that a suitability rating changes after the published date, the new rating will not be reflected until the analyst publishes a subsequent report.
