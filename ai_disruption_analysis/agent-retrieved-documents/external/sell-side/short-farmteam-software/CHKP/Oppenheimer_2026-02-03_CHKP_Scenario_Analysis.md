ANALYTICS, DATA, SECURITY, AND INFRASTRUCTURE SOFTWARE

FY26 Scenario Analysis; Still on Sidelines

Checks and model stress-testing suggest management may guide FY26 revenue growth ~50-100bps above consensus. Concurrently, we forecast margin pressure with incremental S&M required to sustain higher subscription growth. Pattern-wise, we anticipate growth will improve through FY26 as subscription mix increases, pricing discipline emerges, and firewall replacement cycle sustains. Furthermore, checks indicate an improved sales motion with lower discounting and better execution (partners improving to '2-5%' above-plan). Despite these favorable developments, we see little FY26 upside as FX dynamics deteriorate (USD/ILS down ~5% since initial FY26 FX-color) and M&A integrations elevate near-term OpEx. Thus, we're lowering our FY26 margin estimates. We also remain unsure of Check Point's ability to close platform gaps in a crowded market. We remain neutral. Maintain Perform rating.

■ FY26 Subscription Growth Acceleration. At ~45% of revenue and growing faster than all segments, security subscriptions represent the greatest swing factor. Key drivers include Harmony Email (>$120M in ARR), Harmony SASE, and ERM. Our checks suggest improvement in subscription attach rates, greater price discipline, and re-motivated channel partners. In our bull case, we see subscription growth accelerating in FY26 to ~12% from 9.8% in FY25. ■ Pricing Discipline Emerges. Check Point has raised prices in January by 5% across Quantum firewalls, attached subscriptions, support, and maintenance. While the effect of the price increase will take time to fully layer into the model, we expect it will boost revenues more than in prior years, potentially contributing a low-single-digit tailwind to FY26 growth. Checks suggest a stricter stance on discounting.

■ Firewall Product Refresh Sustains. FY25 was a significant firewall refresh year with product revenue growth accelerating ~750bps YoY. We expect refresh momentum to continue into FY26 based on management commentary and our checks that point to a sustained refresh tailwind, and a few replacements. In a bull case, we see product growth of potentially 7.1% in FY26 vs. FY26E consensus of 4.2%. ■ Software Updates & Maintenance Tailwinds. Following elevated firewall unit placements in FY25 and expectations for greater price discipline in FY26, we see potential follow-through to Software Updates/Maintenance growth in FY26. Additionally, we expect professional services growth to accelerate. Put together, we see the potential for software updates/maintenance to accelerate from a 1-2% growth profile in recent years to a 3-4% growth profile longer term.

■ Revenue growth remains in the 0-10% range. ■ Security spending remains at current levels. ■ Demand remains strong for CHKP solutions despite increased competition.

■ Security spending exceeding expectations ■ Revenue growth increases to >10% ■ Increased customer penetration

Check Point is a leading network security vendor with a platform that spans firewalls, cloud, endpoint, and email security.

CHKP has established itself as a leader in the network security market, with a broad platform spanning network security, cloud, and endpoint/email security. Its strategy of selling appliances plus subscription services enables enterprises to have greater security and flexibility to defend critical data and IT networks. We believe Check Point can leverage its platform to deliver midsingle revenue growth with high operating margins.

■ Quarterly earnings calls ■ New product introductions and greater subscription attach rates

■ Product & Licenses : FW refresh momentum continues, 2H-weighted due to timing of renewals (4Qheavy). Improving YoY growth through the year as comps ease. The January price increase is better captured as a result of discounting discipline. ■ Security Subscriptions : growing subscription attach rate and Harmony Email/SASE/ERM mix increases. Improved features and comp incentives drive better attach rates. ■ Software Updates & Maintenance : FW placement follow-through (volume and price), professional services mix increases.
