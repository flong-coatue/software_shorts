RATING HOLD PRICE TARGET NA PRICE $174.36 52-WEEK RANGE $173.77 - $234.36

We update our estimates to account for recent foreign exchange movements, acquisition activity, and the Convertible Debt offering, noting: ■ Operating Margin Pressure: Further weakness to the U.S. Dollar versus the Israeli Shekel since Check Point last reported earnings in late October 2025; and t he impact to the financial model until Check Point laps the Veriti (May 2025) and Lakera (October 2025) acquisitions. ■ Non-GAAP EPS: We expect headwinds to Operating Margin from currency and acquisitions should be more than offset by the December 2025 $1.75 Billion 0.00% Convertible Debt issuance.

■ Reduced Operating Margin Estimates. We lower our Operating Margin estimate to 39.1% from 40.5% in CY26, and to 40.0% from 41.0% in CY27. While not providing CY26 guidance, management previously discussed two headwinds to Operating Margins: (1) approximately $50 Million to $60 Million from currency due to the weaker U.S. Dollar where a significant portion of Check Point's Operating Expenses are in the Israeli Shekel; and (2) the carrying cost for recent acquisitions, such as Lakera where 4QCY25 guidance assumes a 50 basis point impact. □ Consensus: For comparison purposes, consensus currently models Operating Margins of 39.9% in CY26 and 40.3% in CY27.

■ Raising Non-GAAP EPS Estimates. Despite changes to our Operating Margin assumptions, our Non-GAAP EPS forecasts move higher based on assumed Interest Income from the Convertible Debt offering. Our Non-GAAP EPS estimate increases to $10.79 from $10.66 in CY26, and to $12.15 from $11.93 in CY27. □ Consensus: For comparison purposes, consensus currently models EPS of $10.47 in CY26 and $11.61 in CY27.

□ Since Check Point's 3QCY25 earnings call on October 28th, the U.S. Dollar has weakened by another ~3% against the Israeli Shekel. □ The upcoming 1QCY26 will represent the first full quarter of Lakera's expense profile, given the transaction closed on October 22nd. □ Offsetting the headwinds from currency and Lakera, Check Point announced pricing of the upsized Convertible Debt offering on December 4th, which raised $1.75 Billion of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030.

Check Point is a leading provider of enterprise network firewall equipment, security software and professional services. The company operates in a TAM growing 10%-15% each year and will surpass $100 Billion over the next few years, in our view. Following a decadeplus of ongoing share-loss in core firewall, we believe recent investment in Sales & Marketing and Research & Development under new Chief Executive Officer Nadav Zafrir is unlikely to meaningfully re-accelerate organic growth in the near-term. As such, we remain on the sideline with a Hold rating.

Check Point is a Cybersecurity company providing appliances, software, and professional support to address multiple segments of security including network, endpoint, email, mobile, IoT, cloud, and managed security services. Check Point's Infinity platform possesses a unified architecture that underpins all products and services and protects customers from Generation V cyber-attacks. Check Point's primary product segments include Quantum (network security/firewall), CloudGuard (cloud security), Harmony (user, access, and email security), and Horizon (managed security services). The company was founded in 1993 by Gil Schwed, Marius Nacht, and Shlomo Kramer; inventors of the first stateful firewall. Headquarters are in Tel Aviv, Israel and San Carlos, CA.

Our Hold rating for Check Point is based on our view that shares are fairly valued. At the current price, shares trade at an EV/E multiple of 15x our updated CY26 estimate. We await demonstration of durable top-line Growth, resulting from increased investments; and greater clarity on increased investments to drive growth.

Infinity, CloudGuard and New Product Traction Exceeds Expectations. While just <10% of total Revenue, CHKP's Infinity offering has been accelerating. CloudGuard and Harmony also continue to drive durable DD% growth in security subscriptions. If these adjacencies continue to drive growth they could help CHKP exceed our growth expectations. Salesforce Productivity Ramps Following Elevated GTM Investments. Check Point expanded their sales and marketing headcount ~25% in CY22 and ~13% in CY23, with most hiring front-end loaded. While acknowledging the tough macro, as these reps ramp over the coming months they could drive upside to productivity expectations and estimates. New Channel Program Drives Growth and Brand Recognition . Check Point's revamped channel program could drive accelerating growth and renewed brand buy-in among customers and prospects, if successful. New Software Blades See Outsized Uptake. Better than expected adoption of CHKP's software and subscription blades could drive upside to results and support shares.

Transformational M&A Accelerates Growth. If the company were to find the right fit at the right price in a hyper-growth adjacency with strong integration synergies, it could drive re-accelerating top-line growth.

Competition. Competition is intense for CHKP both in core firewall markets and adjacencies as the company expands its platform. Competitors with more aggressive marketing engines could continue to gain share and displace CHKP. Product Revenue Declines Continue. CHKP's product Revenue has declined or remained flat 5 of the last 6 years, while the company's share in core markets has modestly declined 200-300 BPs/year. CHKP is investing to curb these product growth declines, particularly in the U.S., and any mis-execution here could further hurt shares. Global Macro and Firewall Demand Slowdowns. We have heard through channel checks of elongating refresh cycles and dwindling willingness to spend on CapEx (hardware) vs OpEx (software), both potential systemic headwinds to hardware firewall demand as Enterprises shift focus to cloud.

Global Operations Risk . Check Point has strong roots in Israel where HQ and ~40% (as of Dec. 2022) of its employees (primarily in R&D) are based. The current conflict in the region could present an operational risk to the business. Operating Margin Deterioration Worsens. CHKP ramped investments in GTM during 1HCY22 especially, and is leaning more into Channel to turn growth around. This is coming at the expense of operating margins, which have declined 10 of the past 11 years from 60% in 2012 to the low-40% range today. If growth investments do not yield expected fruit, CHKP's operating margins could continue their downward trajectory. Slower than Expected Adoption of New Offerings. CHKP only recently entered the SD-WAN, SASE, and Cloud Security markets in full thrust, and the strategy remains relatively new and opaque. On the flip side, we hear the new Infinity global managed services product has a robust pipeline building.
