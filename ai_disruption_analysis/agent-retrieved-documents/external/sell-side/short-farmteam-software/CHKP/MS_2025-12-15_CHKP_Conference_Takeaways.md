Both CHKP and FTNT spoke to opportunities to take a larger share of the cybersecurity market by expanding GTM reach and upselling existing customers more products. AI remains large opportunity for both, particularly on the Sec Ops side in the near term. Healthy business models look for opportunities for more growth. Across Fortinet and Check Point, conversations highlighted how each company is exploiting new AIdriven growth vectors and platform consolidation trends to support above-market growth objectives. Fortinet emphasized technical differentiation that is supporting broad-based product momentum; Check Point outlined meaningful GTM and cultural changes driving improved execution. Across both names, AI remains a unifying theme-enabling cross-sell uplift, expanding attach opportunities, and supporting margin durability as each company allocates incremental investment. The market continues to look for more evidence of growth beyond core firewall in both of these cases, which both companies highlighted where they are seeing those opportunities.

Conversation with CHKP's CFO centered on strategic changes since the CEO transition a year ago, with substantial overhaul of GTM leadership (new CRO, Head of Americas, CMO), and a cultural reset emphasizing transparency, urgency, and significantly increased C-level engagement. On investment potential to achieve these goals, management remains committed to industry-leading margins, but is willing to modestly reinvest to drive growth above its current ~6% midpoint, with improvements expected to be gradual rather than step-function. Evidence of traction of efforts was noted in the channel, with feedback remaining

positive following the revamped partner program, with increased rebate dollars and deeper C-level engagement contributing to stronger alignment. In terms of traction outside of core firewall, Infinity platform adoption continues to accelerate, supported by a much broader product portfolio across email security, SASE, enterprise risk management and CTEM. Emerging products (SASE, email security, ERM) all grew >40% ARR in Q3; email security has exceeded $150M ARR and is targeting >$200M in 1H26. Given the recent convertible raise, the company noted it was largely opportunistic given the 0% financing rate, but as to M&A potential, noted M&A appetite is expanding via four strategic pillars: hybrid mesh networking, workspace security, CTEM (continuous threat exposure management) and AI security.

Discussion focused on the continued broadening of Fortinet's platform beyond its firewall heritage, with management underscoring the advantages of a unified OS Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

across NGFW, SD-WAN, SASE and SecOps, and the ease of adoption this provides customers. The company noted traction with these initiatives, highlighted by Q3 results of 14% billings/revenue growth, driven by OT security strength and upsell outside of core firewall. AI opportunity centered around new threat vectors the company could protect against and data-center buildouts that create tailwinds for the OT security business. Near-term service-growth softness was acknowledged, but management expects service to follow product outperformance over coming quarters; reiterating confidence in Analyst Day targets-including >30% EBIT margins and mid- to high-30s FCF growth. Upcoming firewall refresh from the postCOVID cohort is seen as a meaningful tailwind in 2H'26, supported by new ASIC launches and refreshed hardware. M M

19x FY27e EPS of $11.20 in FY27, relatively in line with low growth software names.

n Firewall refreshes could sustain longer and stronger than our base case assumptions, driving better top-line growth for Check Point. n Increased S&M and R&D spend could drive better than expected new customer acquisition. n With ~$3.0B in cash on the balance sheet, additional acquisitions to accelerate growth are a risk.

- n Share losses accelerate in CY25/CY26 vs peers who are outspending on S&M.

Based off of 18x our CY27e Base Case FCF of $2,761M, a discount to software peers

n Stronger than expected SD-WAN, OT and Security Fabric adoption could drive estimates/ multiples higher n Continued share buybacks could bolster investor sentiment

n Slowing firewall refreshes, challenging supply chain, and increased competition could drive substantially lower growth n Architectural changes in the security infrastructure could reduce the necessity for network firewalls M
