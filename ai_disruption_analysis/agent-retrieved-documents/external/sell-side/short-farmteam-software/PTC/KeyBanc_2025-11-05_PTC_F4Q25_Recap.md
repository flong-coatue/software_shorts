PTC reported in-line F4Q C.C. ARR results and issued relatively in-line FY26 ARR growth guidance of 7-9%. Notably, the Company announced the divestiture of its Kepware and ThingWorx businesses, which we view positively, as those businesses have been a headwind to overall growth and this presents PTC with greater financial flexibility to invest in other higher-growth areas. We are also encouraged to see the Company guiding to $1B FCF for FY26. We remain positive on PTC's execution and its ability to drive at least mid-teens FCF growth in the NT-MT. Remain Overweight.

In-line F4Q ARR. PTC posted in-line F4Q C.C. ARR growth of 8.5% y/y. PLM growth decelerated to 8.4% (from F3Q's 10%), while CAD accelerated modestly to 8.6% (from F3Q's 8.2%). That said, FCF of $100.5M came in modestly ahead of consensus of $95M.

Announced divestiture of Kepware & ThingWorx businesses. PTC announced the sale of Kepware & ThingWorx (K&T), its industrial connectivity and IoT businesses, to TPG as the Company focuses on its core CAD, PLM, ALM, and SLM offerings. K&T combined contributes ~$160M in ARR (~7% of total mix) in FY25 and has been a modest drag to overall ARR growth. The transaction totaling $725M is expected to close in C1H26 and would yield ~$365M in net proceeds to PTC. Overall, we view this strategic divestiture positively, given the underperformance seen within the K&T businesses, and it enables PTC to allocate greater resources toward higher-growth areas.

Issued $1B FY26 FCF target. While PTC technically issued lower FY26 ARR growth guidance of 7-9% (inclusive of K&T), vs. the Street's 8.8%, we believe that is roughly in line with investors' expectations. The midpoint of the ARR guide implies net add of $195M, similar to prior year's $196M level, with the high end of the guide reflecting continued improved GTM progression and a relatively steady macro, and the low end reflecting unexpected disruption from divestitures and a worsening macro. More importantly, the Company guided to $1B in FCF for FY26, consistent with our preview. While the Company would have to incur ~$160M incremental cash outflows post the closing of K&T, we believe investors are generally encouraged by its ability to guide to that figure.

Adjusting estimates; rolling out FY27 model. To reflect the updated outlook, we are adjusting our FY26 estimates. Given the impending sale of K&T, our estimates still incorporate both businesses. We are also rolling out our FY27 model and rolling forward our valuation framework, though our PT remains unchanged at $245 based on 26.5x FY27 EV/FCF.

Our bull case of $300 is based on 30x our bull-case FY27 EV/ FCF (36x FY26 EV/FCF). ● Like Autodesk and Adobe, PTC completed its model transition to subscription, providing a highly recurring model, accelerating revenue growth, and expanding operating margins. ● PTC continues to execute well, posting above-market growth in its core CAD/PLM markets. ● PTC is the early leader in industrial IoT, and presents highgrowth opportunities. Increasing adoption of AR/VR adds additional opportunities in industrial IoT. ● CAD/PLM markets are late adopters of cloud. The Onshape and Arena acquisitions better position PTC for emerging cloud opportunities. ● Successful integrations of recent acquisitions, including Codebeamer and ServiceMax, could add incremental growth opportunities from cross-sell. ● PTC has a strong opportunity to expand operating margin. The Company is currently at a mid-40% OM and could expand towards high-40s% LT.

● Continued above market growth from PLM and CAD, complemented by cross-sell from activity, could drive ARR growth closer to our bull-case estimate of LDD in FY26 and FY27. This could drive bull-case FCF growth towards +20%, with FCF reaching +$1,200M by FY27. ● Multiple re-rates towards the industrial software average multiple of 30x+.

PTC is currently trading at 20.5x FY27 EV/FCF (23.5x FY26 EV/FCF), compared to the industrial software group trading at an average of 33x EV/FCF. Our price target of $245 is based on 26.5x our FY27 EV/FCF (30.5x FY26 EV/FCF). Market and macroeconomic conditions could interfere with the realization of our price target, as could risks such as exposure to foreign currencies, a slowdown in emerging markets, intensifying competition within its core CAD and PLM segments, integration risks related to its recent acquisitions of Codebeamer and ServiceMax, or the Company being unable to execute on its opportunities in the IoT, AR, and cloud.

Our bear case of $150 is based on 20x our bear-case FY27 EV/ FCF (21x FY26 EV/FCF). ● PTC is unable to execute on its opportunities in AR, IoT, ALM, and cloud. ● PTC experiences slower growth in its core CAD and PLM markets due to intensifying competition and execution-related challenges. ● PTC has about 45% exposure to foreign currencies. Depreciation of currencies would adversely affect PTC's growth. Any further depreciation of currencies poses a risk to PTC's growth. ● PTC has about ~30% exposure to industrial end markets, and a slowdown in PTC's end markets could adversely affect PTC's growth. ● Execution and integration issues with its recent acquisitions, including ServiceMax and Codebeamer. ● ARR growth decelerates to MSD in the N-MT, limiting OM expansion and FCF growth, and driving our bear-case FCF scenario of ~$950M in FY27.
