F4Q Results and Outlook Meet Expectations; Divesting IoT Narrows Focus

PTC delivered F4Q ex-FX ARR growth of 8.5%, settling at the midpoint of guidance (8.0-9.0%), while beating on FCF ($100M vs. Street's $94M est.). While investors tempered FY26 growth expectations, Ex-FX ARR growth guidance of 7.0-9.0% (7.59.5% ex-Kepware/ThingWorx) was still below investor expectations. Optimistically, FCF guidance of ~$1,000M met expectations, with OBBBA optionality potentially inching the forecast higher. Management commented seeing early progress from the new GTM, but cautioned that uncertain macro continues to impact deal dynamics. In a surprise move, PTC is divesting Kepware/ThingWorx to TPG for estimated net upfront proceeds of $365M (April close) to focus resources around its intelligent product lifecycle strategy. PTC intends to increase the pace of repurchases to $150-250M per quarter (from $75M). Reiterating Outperform and $240 price target.

■ FY26 ARR outlook falls short, but FCF aligned with prior target: FY26E exFX ARR growth guidance of 7.0-9.0% was below investor expectations (8.09.0%) and consensus estimate (~8.5%). Growth guidance is 7.5-9.5% excluding Kepware/ThingWorx. Guidance assumes similar linearity to FY25 and is skewed toward F4Q. FCF guidance of $1,000M was in-line with investor expectations and above consensus estimate ($991M) inclusive of Kepware/ThingWorx.

■ F1Q guidance points to NNARR on par with last year: F1Q ex-FX ARR guidance points to net new ARR (NNARR) of $15-25M vs. FY25/24's $22M/$40M. PTC noted entering FY26 with a stronger pipeline and better visibility than FY25. Management projects F1Q FCF of $265-270M, and ~60% to surface in 1H. PTC expects ~$160M of cash outflows related to the divestiture in the 1H.

■ F4Q ARR in-line due to deal structuring: Ex-FX ARR of $2,446M (8.5% y/y) was bracketed by guidance (8.0-9.0% y/y) and slightly below consensus (Street: ~$2,447M) due to a higher mix of large deals with deferred structures. PLM ARR grew 8.5% y/y (-80bps q/q; -430bps y/y) in constant currency. CAD grew 8.6% y/y (+40bps q/q; -130bps y/y). FCF was better than expected ($100M vs. ~$90-95M guide).

■ Streamlining portfolio with Kepware and ThingWorx divestiture: PTC announced the divestiture of Kepware and ThingWorx to TPG for which it estimates net upfront proceeds of $365M and expects to close in 1H. We view this as a continuation of PTC's focus on its intelligent product lifecycle strategy since CEO Neil Barua's appointment. Investors view the divestiture as a positive sign that management will be proactive in maximizing shareholder value. ■ Potential investor pushback: While the increase in multi-year ramp deals is a positive long-term development, investors focused on seeing progress in FY26 will likely be disappointed that revenue timing is pushed out. There was also some disappointment that NNARR is essentially unchanged from FY25 ($195 vs. $194M) despite not being weighed down by idiosyncratic churn, and embedding some GTM improvements.

■ Core ARR (PLM and CAD) continue to grow HSD to LDD ■ PTC sees PLM expansion activity, uptake of cloud products and some success with cross-sell of ServiceMax, ALM and Codebeamer ■ Steady trajectory of FCF margin expansion will put FY26E target of $1,000M within reach

■ Macro conditions ease loosening up manufacturing budgets and ARR growth accelerates ■ Cross-sell, expansion activity, and cloud adoption are better than expected

We arrive at our $240 PT using an 8-year DCF that projects an ARR CAGR of 9% and a terminal EBIT margin of 43%. We applied a terminal cash flow multiple of 25.5x (3.2x PEG), discounted at a WACC of 11%.

■ Execution of GTM transition and divestiture of ThingWorx and Kepware businesses ■ PTC has managed expenses effectively and investors worry PTC may have to make catch-up investments ■ Above-market growth rates of core PLM and CAD businesses prove unsustainable ■ Macroeconomic activity in manufacturing deteriorates leading to higher churn rates and deceleration of ARR growth ■ Lack of churn improvement and productivity gains in growth businesses limits margin and free cash flow expansion causing PTC to fall short of FY25E FCF target.

PTC develops product lifecycle management (PLM) and computer-aided design (CAD) software and product management solutions for the industrial manufacturing end-market.

We expect PTC to maintain a leadership position in product lifecycle management (PLM) and computer-aided design (CAD) to deliver durable HSD/LDD growth. Underlying strength and digitization trends in PLM open up paths to potentially accelerate ARR growth. Management is expected to balance growth and profitability to drive margin expansion free cash flow growth above ARR growth.

■ PLM and ALM demand; better price realization; Cloud adoption; ServiceMax and Codebeamer cross-sell; ■ F1QE earnings results ■ Potential Investor Day ■ Accretive share repurchases

■ Above-market growth rates of core PLM and CAD businesses prove unsustainable ■ Softer than expected PLM expansion activity, cloud adoption is weaker than expected, and ServiceMax/ ALM/ Codebeamer crosssell does not materialize

■ There is some success with larger deals that you see in the appendix of the earnings presentation ■ Weren't getting these deals before, more engagement with c-level and that's having an impact ■ GTM progress paying off in larger and longer duration deals ■ More customers are thinking of standardization and environment of larger more strategic deals

■ The outlook embeds some GTM improvement; how much is a question ■ It's in the midpoint and high end of guidance; more at the high-end ■ The high-end of guidance would be an acceleration over this year ■ The difference in NNARR between this year and last year ($30M) is 50% idiosyncratic churn and rest is deal structure ■ Have executed well and have GTM momentum even though it's not showing up in PTC's reported numbers. It's in the RPO ■ Have contractual commitments in ramps for outer years that's higher ■ Deferred ARR nominally better in FY26 but not that much ■ It's also skewed to F4Q ■ This year the back-end loaded nature, some of it is contracted deferred ARR so different level of visibility vs. this past year ■ The quarterly NNARR is more a reflection of how deals have been setup over the past few years so just guiding to what the renewal schedule is ■ 1H revenue growth will be higher is more about easier comp from last year in 1H

■ There is guidance for cash taxes is it will be ~$130-150M vs. $122M last year ■ Beginning FY26 will no longer capitalize US R&D and that's a benefit that's built into guidance ■ Without OBBBA cash tax will be higher ■ The next step is the claw backs and PTC still taking its time to decide how it maximizes overall cash taxes

■ PTC wants to stay focused and IoT will be owned by TPG and can focus on its own growth ■ The transition service agreement starts when the deal closes ■ The intent is there will be a period (could continue through to FY27) ■ When will those businesses be self-sufficient so it depends how long it takes for that to be the case ■ It will end once the business is self-sufficient ■ Two specific earn outs; one is after close and certain things need to happen to get the first one ■ The second earn-out ($35M) there's language in the 8-k that indicates there's working capital requirements ■ Not assuming that earn-out won't be earned ■ 8-K will reference average receivables that were in the past so that earn-out is assumed as not earned ■ The $125M earn out could happen but won't know for a little while until post-close

■ The buyer needs to make the business work so not mechanical ■ IoT business was profitable, but it depends on the growth profile ■ lower growth better cash flow ■ higher growth less cash flow ■ This business used to have awful cash flow when PTC was throwing tons of R&D resources at it but once PTC pivoted it became more profitable ■ Expecting ~$50M headwind to cash flow in FY27 PTC (PTC) Income Statement
