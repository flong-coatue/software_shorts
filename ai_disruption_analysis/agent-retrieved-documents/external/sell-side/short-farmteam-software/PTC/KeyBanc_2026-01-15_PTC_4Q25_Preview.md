We spoke to a broad set of industrial software resellers as part of our qtr-end channel checks. Feedback across the board has been generally upbeat with encouraging demand trends thus far in January. Notably, our ADSK checks were the most upbeat, giving us some comfort that the Company is tracking ahead of plans at mid-qtr. We also see a positive C4Q setup for TRMB on our in-line to slightly better checks, and potential C.C. ARR upside for BSY. While we expect a more in-line print for PTC, our checks picked up the Company's increasing ambition in e-store, which we view positively.

● PTC: Similar to the prior quarter, our PTC checks were upbeat with large deal activity. That said, with increasing ramp deal structures, the recent CFO transition, and the pending divestiture of Kepware and ThingWorx, we would look for more in-line F1Q C.C. ARR results and FY26 guidance reiterated. Notably, the channel highlighted PTC's greater push of SMB customers toward the e-store, which we find encouraging, particularly after the success seen from peers such as Autodesk and Bentley, as it could drive greater sales efficiency and higher margins LT. ● ADSK: At mid-quarter, our U.K. and U.S. AEC and manufacturing resellers are tracking ahead of plan. Channel cited notable strength in construction, and our U.K. checks saw better demand in manufacturing.

● TRMB: Feedback from geospatial resellers was a tad more upbeat vs. prior quarters. Based on our checks and our renewed confidence in the Company's execution, we see upward bias to Trimble's 4Q as-reported results. For 2026, we expect Trimble to reiterate its prior revenue growth expectation of MSD-HSD, and issue ARR growth of low- to mid-teens and EPS growth of at least DD, which would be in line with our estimates. Additionally, our checks picked up that Trimble has started perpetualto-subscription transition for a few Field Systems software, further supporting our confidence in the Company's ability to deliver low-teens+ ARR growth over the MT.

● BSY: End market read-throughs suggest infrastructure remains resilient. With the closing of two acquisitions in December, we see upward bias to our above-consensus 4Q C.C. ARR growth of 11.5%. Given the more limited M&A contributions in recent years, we see the Company likely issuing C.C. ARR growth outlook on an organic basis, and would view 11-11.5% as in line with our and the consensus estimate.

● DSY-FR: Channel tone consistent with prior quarters with resellers finishing 4Q in line. While large deal activity pertaining to the SolidWorks channel was softer than anticipated, that was offset by higher deal velocity in the lower-end customer segments. As a result, we see potential for Dassault posting in-line 4Q reported revenue results. That said, we believe the main focus will be on Dassault's ability to accelerate revenue growth in 2026. While we acknowledge that mgmt execution has been inconsistent, with the potential of FX headwind moderating, we see the potential for Dassault to post more in-line 2026 reported revenue growth guide vs. consensus of 4.2% (implying 2.6 pts of acceleration).

We spoke to over a dozen resellers from the PTC, Autodesk, Dassault SolidWorks, and Trimble channels in the U.S. and the U.K., with insights into various sub-verticals, including architecture, civil engineering, construction, infrastructure, geospatial, residential real estate, manufacturing, and surveying.

● ' F1Q came in well ahead of our expectations mainly due to these two large aerospace Windchill and Codebeamer deals we closed in the quarter. Pipeline is shaping up similar to how we entered this time last year, but macro seems to have improved this year, compared to last year. We've also heard that PTC is directing more low-end customers towards their e-store, so us channel partners can focus on larger customers. ' - PTC Reseller ● ' We beat F1Q on a handful of large deals and a bunch of other smaller deals. Some of the large deals we closed have been in the pipeline for a year, and are more 'land and expand' deals that customers have finally decided to get deployed enterprise-wide. We're off to a good start this year, and we look to do at least 15% growth for this year. While the volume of deal is lower than last year, the quality is better this year as we have some really large, 7-figure deals in the pipeline. ' - PTC Reseller

● ' We've been beating our sales targets thus far this quarter, and we're on track to do 115% by quarter end. Strength was partly due to some internal expansion in sales capacity, but also construction has been strong. ' - Autodesk Reseller ● 'We're tracking ahead of quota so far, and with only a couple of weeks left in the quarter, we feel good about being able to beat targets, likely 10%+ above. December was pretty slow with the holidays, but we've seen good momentum in January thus far.' - Autodesk Reseller

● ' 4Q was inline and we ended the year growing 5% or so, maybe a bit higher than that. We didn't close many large deals in the quarter, but made it up from a lot of smaller deals. Automotive and auto suppliers had been decent throughout the year, and we've seen some all the smaller customers with <10 seats expand more at the end of the year to 20+. Our teams selling simulation and Enovia that our company acquired recently have been doing well too. Looking at 2026, demand trends have been quite good, and customers seem to be less hesitant than last year. 3DX will likely again be the push. ' - Dassault SolidWorks Reseller ● 'Demand has been more or less the same as last quarter, fairly stable. 4Q had a bunch of yearend promotions as always, but maybe more so this year given SolidWork's 30th year celebration.' -Dassault SolidWorks Reseller

● ' We saw good demand through the end of the year and ending the quarter meeting our budget. Did not see any large deals come through but there's projects kicking off, whether its infrastructure related like highways and interchange, or public and private funded projects like high speed rail. There's also ongoing projects including a new stadium and two new hotels in our area happening. Thus far in Jan has been slightly better than expected and we hope that momentum continues and look to grow 10% in 2026. ' - Trimble Geospatial Reseller ● ' Demand has been steady, vs. last quarter. Saw some disruption and orders getting pushed in 4Q due to Government Shutdown, but the impact was less dramatic than we thought, and we were able to make it up in other areas like private sector and from local and state governments. ' - Trimble Geospatial Reseller

PTC will be reporting its F1Q26 earnings on February 4, 2026, after market close.

Our U.S. and European PTC checks were relatively upbeat, which is consistent with prior quarter's tone. Most of our resellers ended F1Q in line to better with strength stemming from Windchill and Codebeamer, and from end-markets such as aerospace and industrial. A couple of our resellers also attributed their outperformance from better large deal activity (with multi-year and ramp structure) in the quarter. For FY26, resellers noted NT pipeline is good with several large deals in the funnel. Additionally, we picked up from the channel that PTC has recently made a bigger push to drive a greater number of low-end customers toward its e-store/self-service platform, enabling channel partners to focus on serving larger clients. We are encouraged by this initiative, esp. after seeing success from peers such as Autodesk and Bentley, as it could drive greater sales efficiency and higher margins LT.

While our checks are generally upbeat esp. around large deal activity, we are reminded that ramp deals could have a delayed impact to ARR. As a result, we expect PTC to post more in-line F1Q C.C. ARR growth of 8.3%, which would be consistent with our and the consensus estimate. For FY26, given the pending divestiture of Kepware and ThingWorx (expected to close C1H26) and the recent CFO transition (Jennifer DiRico succeeding Kristian Talvitie, effective Jan 1, 2026), we expect PTC to maintain its full-year ARR and FCF guidance. We maintain our OW rating as we remain encouraged by PTC's focus on driving durable FCF growth, and we maintain our PT of $245 based on 31x FY26 EV/FCF.

Autodesk has a January quarter-end and has not disclosed its F4Q26 earnings date at this time. U.K. and U.S. AEC and manufacturing resellers we spoke with at mid-quarter seem to be tracking ahead of plans. Channel cited good deal activity and customer inbound in the month of November and thus far in January. Resellers also saw particular strength from construction, and one of our U.K. resellers noted better than expected seat expansion activity from its manufacturing customers. We remain positive on Autodesk's growth opportunities within construction and infrastructure, and maintain our thesis for potential multiple expansion above the industrial software average of +30x over the LT. We remain Overweight and maintain our PT of $365 based on 30.5x FY27 EV/FCF.

Trimble has yet to provide an earnings date for 4Q25. Feedback from U.S. based geospatial resellers were a touch more upbeat than prior quarters. While most resellers noted demand trends remain steady and a couple observe order delays from Federal, others highlighted strength in private sector, state and local municipalities, and ongoing infrastructurerelated projects such as highways and rail supporting continued demand. Additionally, we picked up from the channel that Trimble has started its perpetual license to subscription model transition of a few Field Systems-related field (Trimble Access) and office (Trimble Business Center) software in the beginning of 2026, and existing perpetual license customers are offered discounts to migrate to subscriptions. We are encouraged to hear that Trimble is executing against its model transition within Field Systems, positioning the company well to drive greater recurring revenue mix within that segment and supporting our renewed confidence in Trimble's ability to sustain at least low-teens ARR growth over the MT (see our recent U/G note in Dec. 2025 here).

Based on our in-line to modestly better checks, we see upward bias to Trimble's 4Q as-reported revenue results (vs. our and consensus estimates of $949.4M and $948M, respectively) with potential outperformance stemming from AECO and Field Systems. Similarly, we see upward bias to Trimble's 4Q as-reported organic ARR growth, vs. our estimate of 13.7%.

In terms of 2026, Trimble has already given an initial revenue outlook of MSD-HSD, and we expect the Company to reiterate that expectation. For ARR, we see the Company likely guiding low- to mid-teens for full-year growth, which would be consistent with our estimate of 13.3%. In terms of profitability, we believe Trimble has been executing well in expanding margins, despite the lack of top-line leverage (headwinds from Ag and Mobility divestiture) in the past couple of years. As the model gets "relatively cleaner" in 2026, along with continued operating leverage, we see Trimble guiding to ~50 bps of y/y EBITDA margin expansion in 2026 (largely in line with our estimate of ~60 bps expansion and above consensus's flat expectation), and drive at least DD EPS growth (vs. our estimate of 11.5% and consensus estimate of 11%).

We remain confident in Trimble's low-teens ARR and DD EPS growth framework, which is supportive of multiple expanding higher to at least parity with broader industrial SW peers at 30x. We reiterate our Overweight rating and $99 price target.

Bentley has yet to provide an earnings date for 4Q25. Our industrial software checks highlighting consistent public sector strength gives us confidence that Bentley's core public works and utilities segment remains positive. Bentley also announced the closing of two tuck-in acquisitions (Talon Aerolytics and the technology and technical expertise of Pointivo) in December; we expect M&A to contribute modestly (roughly 40-70 bps) C.C. to ARR growth in 4Q. And in terms of FX, the EUR to USD currency exchange rate has moved nominally from ~$1.16 per €1.00 at the end of October to ~$1.17 per €1.00 currently (<1% movement), implying more limited impact from FX. As a result, for 4Q, we see upward bias to our and consensus C.C. ARR growth estimates of 11.5% and 11.3%, respectively. Historically, Bentley has embedded modest contributions from

programmatic acquisitions of ~50 bps in its full-year C.C. ARR growth guidance. That said, programmatic M&A has been more limited in the past couple of years, and as a result, we could see Bentley excluding that modest portion from its initial 2026 outlook and guiding to full-year C.C. ARR growth, on an organic basis, of 11-11.5%. That would be largely in line with our and consensus estimates of 11% and 11.3%, respectively, and relatively consistent with what the Company has guided to in the past organically. Additionally, we would view any passage of permitting reform and Asset Analytics contributions as potential upside drivers. For FCF, we expect Bentley to guide FCF outlook toward our above-consensus estimate of $534.6M (vs. consensus $520M), reflecting core FCF growth of at least LDD and OBBBA tailwinds.

We maintain that Bentley's DD LT growth framework, along with consistent OM expansion to 35-40%, is supportive of a premium valuation vs. industrial SW peers. We reiterate our Overweight rating and $63 PT.

Dassault will be reporting its 4Q25 earnings on February 11, 2026, before market open. Our U.S. Dassault SolidWorks resellers finished 4Q largely in line as planned. While our SolidWorks channel noted large deal activity was softer than anticipated in the quarter, that was offset by greater deal velocity and volume in the lower end of the market. Resellers also saw decent expansion activity among SMB customers, taking advantage of typical year-end promotions. Additionally, demand trend thus far in 2026 has been encouraging with resellers highlighting less scrutiny from customers compared to last year.

In terms of FX, currency has moved nominally in the past couple of months since Dassault reported 3Q25, with the EUR vs. USD exchange rate holding at ~$1.16 per €1.00. That compares to Dassault's 4Q exchange rate guidance of $1.17 per €1.00, which implies FX impact would be relatively neutral to 4Q reported results. Based on our checks (that are more SolidWorks channel focused), we see potential for the Company to post more in-line 4Q reported revenue and EPS results, compared to our revenue estimate of €1,758M (vs. consensus estimate of €1,769M) and our EPS estimate of €0.42 (vs. consensus of €0.43).

In terms of 2026, while no official guidance has been provided by Dassault, the Company has given some qualitative comments on its 3Q call, including the expectation of many of the large deals signed in 2025 to begin contributing in 2026, the expectation of Life Sciences to stop declining in 2026, and the expectation of Centric PLM to improve (after lapping headwinds from large renewal cohort and model transition acceleration). We acknowledge that management execution track record has been inconsistent,

though balancing these factors and the potential for the FX headwind to moderate, we see the potential for Dassault to issue a more in-line 2026 reported revenue outlook, vs. a consensus estimate of €6,574M (compared to our estimate of €6,641M), which implies revenue growth accelerating by 2.6 pts to 4.2% growth (vs. our estimate of growth accelerating by 3.6 pts to 5.2%). For EPS, we also see the potential for the Company to issue largely in-line 2026 EPS guidance, compared to our estimate of €1.39 and consensus of €1.38. While we see continued strength in certain Dassault product areas and view its LT growth opportunity in cloud positively, we maintain a more balanced view on the Company given NT macro challenges and uncertainty in selected end markets, such as life sciences and automotive. Remain Sector Weight.

We believe Autodesk has a strong franchise and good opportunities in construction. We have increasing confidence that Autodesk is expanding its use cases from its move to subscription and believe it could see accelerating FCF. Our price target of $365 is based on 30.5x FY27 EV/FCF. ADSK is trading at 22x FY27 EV/FCF, which compares to the industrial software average of 31x. We rate ADSK Overweight. It closed January 15, 2026, at $262.26. Market and macroeconomic conditions could impede the stock from achieving our price target, as could risks such as pricing pressure, increased competition, or the slower adoption of new offerings.

We believe Bentley's DD LT growth framework, along with consistent OM expansion to 35-40% and interesting growth opportunities in infrastructure and digital twins, is supportive of a premium valuation vs. industrial software peers. Our price target of $63 is based on 41x our 2026E EV/FCF (or 39x after adjusting for the double-counting of convertible debt in EV calc.). BSY is currently trading at 24x our 2026E EV/FCF (adj. for convert), compared to the industrial software group average of 31x. We rate BSY Overweight. It closed January 15, 2026, at $39.07. Market and macroeconomic conditions could impede the stock from achieving our price target and estimates, as could company-specific risks, including the inability to up-sell and cross-sell products and drive account accretion; increased competition; a delay in the pace of E365 account conversion; and any integration issues with its acquisitions.

Dassault is currently trading at 18.5x 2026E EV/FCF, which compares to the broader industrial software group trading at an average of 31x. While we see continued strength in Dassault's certain product areas and view its LT growth opportunity in cloud positively, we maintain a more balanced view on the Company given NT uncertainty in selected end markets such as life sciences and automotive . We rate DSY Sector Weight. It closed January 15, 2026, at €24.24. Market and macroeconomic conditions could interfere with the realization of our fair value estimate, as could risks including, but not limited to, a macro slowdown, exposure to foreign currencies, increasing competition, or execution issues related to acquisition integration, product development, and GTM.

PTC is currently trading at 21x FY27 EV/FCF, compared to the industrial software group trading at an average of 31x EV/FCF. Our price target of $245 is based on 26.5x our FY27 EV/FCF. We rate PTC Overweight. It closed January 15, 2026, at $166.89. Market and macroeconomic conditions could interfere with the realization of our price target, as could risks such as exposure to foreign currencies, a slowdown in emerging markets, intensifying competition within its core CAD and PLM segments, integration risks related to its recent acquisitions of Codebeamer and ServiceMax, or the Company being unable to execute on its opportunities in the IoT, AR, and cloud.

TRMB is currently trading at 24x 2026E EV/FCF, vs. the broader industrial software group at 31x. Our price target of $99 is based on 30x our 2026E EV/FCF. WE rate TRMB Overweight. It closed January 15, 2026, at $78.57. Market and macroeconomic risks could interfere with the realization of our estimates and price target, as could company-specific risks, including integration delays or issues with its acquisitions; execution issues regarding its subscription model transition and GTM; an extended equipment replacement cycle, which could negatively impact Trimble's surveying equipment business; and increasing competition from Trimble's existing verticals, especially from construction software.
