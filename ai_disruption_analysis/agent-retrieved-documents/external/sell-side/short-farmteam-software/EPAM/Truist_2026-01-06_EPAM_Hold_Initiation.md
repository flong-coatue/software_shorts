✓ Initiation of Coverage

EPAM - Initiating Hold, $220 PT: Digital Transformation & Product Engineering for the Enterprise Initiate with a Hold rating and $220 PT. We view EPAM as an improving, but in-transition IT Services asset. Growth is still subdued, but improving; AI investments are driving incremental wins, and valuation is pressured given mis-steps in guidance and execution. Additionally, continued progress toward scaling its GenAI business and proof points of successful integration of recent M&A could make us more constructive on the stock. See here for our initiation industry overview.

Battle-tested management team. In our view, EPAM remains a differentiated digital engineering and product development partner focused on servicing Global 2000 customers. The company has absorbed an operational shock from the Russia-Ukraine war, which resulted in a massive reconfiguration of its headcount from Belarus/Russia/Ukraine to India/ LatAM/EU. While growth was pressured impacted due to client churn (and macro), the company did a nice job with mitigating the impact that would have been expected from a massive operational shift.

Clawing its way back to growth. With a large part of revenues from the Americas (58%) and EMEA (40%), the company is building back its growth algorithm, with mid/high singledigit revenue growth. The company has been largely focused on stabilizing its operations after the shock of the 2022 Ukraine/Russia war. In 2025, the company is expected to grow 15% (10.6% through contributions from Neoris and First Derivative), and exit FY25 with 4Q growth of ~11% (including inorganic). Growth is driven by improvement across its business, which has also given the company the confidence to grow headcount. Headcount growth (+17.3%) YTD is exceeding revenue growth (+16.4%), suggesting bookings strength that should support mid/high single-digit growth into FY26. Operating margins have also started to improve, partially driven by mix and AI-driven productivity. FCF conversions remains healthy, indicative of a stabilizing business.

Transformative shift to AI: EPAM is undergoing its second meaningful transformative shift in five years (after diversifying its geographic footprint since 2022). EPAM is now undergoing an AI led transformation which is significantly more complicated as it has operational, sales, pricing, GTM, financial implications. We are optimistic about the company's strategy and messaging, and it appears that it is resonating with customers. However, we think it is still early to determine success, and we don't have visibility to fully appreciate all the work that is being done under the hood.

We initiate on EPAM with a price target of $220 (by applying a 17.5x P/E multiple on our FY26 EPS estimate) and a Hold rating: While we expect that secular AI tailwinds should support EPAM's growth trajectory and offer mild multiple expansion, we launch with a Hold rating given the company's pressured billing rate dynamics, and ongoing integration of recent large M&A. Upside risks include potential for AI uplift and the completion and potential benefit of its geographic repositioning efforts. Downside risks include macroeconomic headwinds and pricing challenges.

· Battle-tested management team. In our view, EPAM remains a differentiated digital engineering and product development partner focused on servicing Global 2,000 customers. The company has absorbed an operational shock from the Russia-Ukraine war, which resulted in a massive reconfiguration of its headcount from Belarus/Russia/Ukraine to India/LatAm/EU. While growth has been pressured due to client churn (and macro), the company has successfully repositioned headcount while largely mitigating financial impacts that would have been expected from a massive operational shift.

· Clawing its way back to growth. With a large part of revenues from the Americas (58%) and EMEA (40%), the company is building back its growth algorithm, with mid/high single-digit revenue growth. The company has been largely focused on stabilizing its operations after the shock of the 2022 Ukraine/Russia war. In 2025, we expect the company to grow 15% (10.6% through contributions from Neoris and First Derivative) and exit FY25 with 4Q growth of ~11% (including inorganic). Growth is driven by improvement across its business, which has also given the company the confidence to grow headcount. Headcount growth (+17.3%) YTD is exceeding revenue growth (+16.4%), suggesting bookings strength that should support mid/high single-digit growth in FY26. Operating margins have also started to improve, partially driven by mix and AI-driven productivity. FCF conversions remains healthy, indicative of a stabilizing business.

· Transformative shift to AI: EPAM is undergoing its 2 nd meaningful transformative shift in 5 years (after diversifying its geographic footprint since 2022). EPAM is now undergoing an AI-led transformation which is significantly more complicated as it has operational, sales, pricing, GTM, financial implications. We are optimistic around the company's strategy and messaging, and it appears that it is resonating with customers. However, we think it is still early to determine success, and we don't have internal visibility to fully appreciate all the work that is being done under the hood.

· While growth is driven by AI-led deals, significant AI risk remains: EPAM's core offering could be pressured as GenAI LLM's and tools continue to improve at a rapid pace. Based on our research, enterprises already expect a compression in billable hours with the expectation of AI-assisted coding assistants (Anysphere (private), Lovable (private), Replit (private), etc.) enhancing developer productivity. As these AI coding assistants improve, there may be more self-reliance (insource) instead of working with IT Services firms such as EPAM. Equally important, it is unclear if clients will share some of the productivity gains with EPAM or look to pay for the AI tools separately.

· Valuation: Today, EPAM trades much closer to its 5-year low NTM P/E multiple of 11.9x at 16.0x relative to its 5-year average of 29.9x. IT Services is out of favor and given the company's repositioning challenges, we believe that the sell-off has largely been warranted. While we expect that the same secular AI tailwinds that will support ACN exist offering mild multiple expansion, we launch with a Hold rating given the company's pressured billing rate dynamics, and ongoing integration of recent large M&A.

· EPAM has historically been a major beneficiary of technology step changes and waves of enterprise spend around new and emerging technology with cloud being the most recent example. · Management indicates that GenAI implementation saves ~50 minutes a day for coders, increases velocity by 5%-10% and contributes 10% of new code alone. · EPAM predicts that due to the overwhelming benefits of AI implementation within enterprises, that companies intend on increasing AI spend by 14% on average in 2025 and that disruptors attribute 53% of their profits to AI investments in 2025. Source: Company Reports

· Pivoting to an AI-native business model: EPAM's growth in 2025 has largely been driven by its AI-related work. While the company does not explicitly break out AI revenues, it indicated that AI-driven deals drove the third consecutive quarter of sequential double-digit growth in AI-native revenues through 3Q25, which enabled it to raise FY25 targets from 4.0% to 4.6% at the midpoint regarding revenue growth for the year on an organic constant currency basis. Further, EPAM has indicated that recent large wins are 'AI native,' which essentially includes managing end-to-end AI deployments, automating core workflows and charges a premium for consulting work.

· 'Embedded AI' is included in its offering: EPAM monetizes on its AI through embedding AI in its consulting, managed services and DIAL platform. EPAM's DIAL is an orchestration platform that enables enterprises to integrate LLMs from a range of providers including AWS Bedrock (AMZN, Buy, Squali), Anthropic Claude (private), etc. This allows its clients to remain nimble across LLMs, and avoids vendor lock-in. With its most recent release (June 2025), it enables enterprises to quickly integrate and scale AI capabilities across its business.

· While pivoting to AI is essential, speed is necessary to mitigate disruption risk: Having observed the IT Services industry for ~20 years, and EPAM for 10+ years, we appreciate the AI-induced industry challenges that EPAM and others face. EPAM has navigated several tech-led disruptions (cloud, mobile etc.), multiple wars (2014; 2022-present) and has several scars that are still visible. We remain optimistic that EPAM will be able to reshape its offering in an AI-dominated world. While we are encouraged with its early steps, we would like to see some of these AI-related investments drive scaled benefits before becoming more constructive on the stock. Source: Company Reports

· EPAM has established AI partnerships with a range of companies across the tech stack, including AWS, Microsoft Azure OpenAI (private) Services, Google Cloud and 150+ ecosystem partners. Based on the visibility that we have, we believe that while these partnerships are important, it is unclear if they provide EPAM with a competitive advantage compared to other IT Services companies. · AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft seem to be its largest partnerships: · EPAM does not explicitly break out size of its relationships, as they are largely tech agnostic. However, we believe that AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft (MSFT, Buy, Tillman) are relatively more meaningful. · EPAM leverages AWS to build specialized agents, and we believe that EPAM accesses Anthropic Claude through AWS. Similarly, EPAM accesses OpenAI (private) LLM's through its Microsoft partnerships. Source: Company Reports

EPAM's core value proposition of being its clients' digital and tech partner is being challenged by GenAI solutions and private companies that use GenAI is their foundational offerings. While there are several areas of risk, we highlight three areas:

· AI-powered delivery: Enterprises are reluctant to pay a premium for billable hours, when AI accelerates delivery. Further, with an AI-powered solution (vibe coding tools) assistance, the expectation is a significant compression of billable hours. · Significant accommodation at the mid/junior level: The pyramid structure that EPAM's is built on is at risk. AI solutions are able to do more of the mid/junior level work, which disrupts the necessary training and experience that employees need to move to higher skill levels. · Direct GenAI competition: Enterprises are empowering their own employees with GenAI solutions. With the significant boost to productivity and the lack of need to have a specialized tech skill set, enterprises have increased the reliance on their own employees, thereby reducing the need to work with EPAM, Globant (GLOB, Hold) and other IT Services firms.

· EPAM was heavily impacted by the slowdown in enterprise tech spend in 2023-2024 and was further burdened by a geographic headcount migration out of Eastern Europe due to the Russia/Ukraine war. Impressively, EPAM has begun to reverse course in late FY24 and in 1H25, however the majority of EPAM's growth acceleration is attributed to its recent acquisitions of Neoris and First Derivative, both of which closed in 4Q24. · Despite choppy revenue growth, EPAM has maintained operating margin above 16% and EPS is back to a growth cadence. (Amounts in millions) Source: Truist Securities, Company Reports

- · Historically, large increases in headcount can precede revenue growth swings as hiring for waves of new projects occurs ahead of delivery. EPAM has scaled headcount, largely due to recent large M&A, which should aid in the support of higher revenue levels.

- · From a geographical perspective, EPAM is organized into three markets: 1) Americas; 2) EMEA; and 3) APAC. In FY24, these regions made up ~60%, ~38%, and ~2% of total revenue, respectively. In recent quarters, all markets have shown impressive rebounds in Y/Y growth, however the recent performance in EMEA and Americas (largely on the back of EPAM's two large M&A deals) has been noteworthy. We note that a continued rebound in these markets are outsized drivers of total revenue and momentum needs to continue to build to see a re-rating in the stock.

P/E Bull Case CY26E EPS $12.86 Multiple 21.0x Implied Value $270 Implied R eturn 30.7% Our bull case assumes that E P A M will drive revenue growth of +9.0% in F Y 26E resulting in annual adjusted E P S of $12.86. T his scenario assumes that E PAM's AI-native revenues, which have exhibited three consecutive quarters of double-digit sequential growth, convert more quickly than expected out of E P A M's backlog driving high-single-digit growth. In this case, we would expect E P A M's client base to build back more quickly than anticipated following success in F Y 25. Our bull case also reflects an inflection in E P A M's A mericas market (58% of total revenue), which would be met with optimism from investors thereby driving multiple expansion, in our view.

| BearCase | $12.15     | 14.0x      | $170           | -17.6%          |

Our bear case assumes that E PAM will drive 3% revenue growth in FY 26E resulting in annual adjusted E P S of $12.15. T his scenario assumes that E PAM's recent M&A (Neoris and First Derivative) fail to quickly scale along with the rest of the business following integration. Our bear case is also representative of a worsening in the current macroeconomic environment (rising interest rates, escalating of the E astern E uropean conflict, etc.) which would result in client hesitation regarding project starts. In our view, this would sour investor sentiment and result in multiple compression. Source: Truist Securities, FactSet Bull Case

· EPAM's current share price implies P/E and EV/sales multiples of 16.4x and 1.8x our 2026 estimates, respectively. While we view EPAM as maintaining deep AI-expertise backed by secular AI tailwinds, we launch on EPAM with an initial price target of $220 (by applying a 17.5x P/E multiple on our FY26 EPS estimates) and a Hold rating. · In our view, our 17.5x multiple (stock trading at 16.4x our FY26 estimates) is justified as we believe that the stock should trade at a slight discount to Accenture (ACN, Buy), for whom we apply a 23.0x FY26 multiple. While we expect that the same secular AI tailwinds that will support ACN exist offering mild multiple expansion, we believe that a discount for EPAM is warranted until company's pressured pricing dynamics begin to ease, and until we see proof points of successful integration of recent large M&A.

| P/E                      | 18.1x   | 16.4x   | 14.5x   |

- · We view our 17.5x P/E valuation multiple as appropriate as it represents a discount to Accenture and a modest discount to the peer group (all figures are FactSet consensus estimates). We believe a discount is justified given EPAM's idiosyncratic dynamics (namely integration of recent large M&A and geographic shifting of headcount). We look for proof points of successful integration and continued execution at key accounts to unlock multiple expansion.

- · Based on historical P/E multiples, we think the stock is trading at a reasonable level compared to historical norms. Today, EPAM trades much closer to its five-year low multiple of 11.9x at 16.0x relative to its five-year average of 29.9x. We think the discount is warranted given industry-wide demand pressure and recent slowdown in IT spend, as well as company-specific geographic repositioning challenges.

· Macroeconomic headwinds: EPAM, as well as the broader IT Services industry, is heavily exposed to macro elements, such as political policies and interest rates. Negative tariff implications and a high-interest rate environment tends to result in enterprises being cautious with growth spend as it pertains to technology, particularly as it relates to 'discretionary' projects that EPAM has less visibility into and builds through the fiscal year (vs. larger projects with high revenue visibility over several quarters or even years). If the macroeconomic conditions worsen and enterprises globally or in certain regions become cautious, EPAM will be negatively impacted as it pertains to top line growth.

· Pricing challenges: IT Services providers across the industry have experienced pricing pressure the last couple of years; i.e., they have struggled raising prices in an inflationary environment, and many providers have even resorted to competing on price in the form of discounts. Recently, EPAM has witnessed a trend of clients pushing for more fixed-price contracts vs. the more traditional time & material (historically >85% of revenue vs. now 80% today) contract structure for projects.

· AI Uplift: EPAM is now undergoing an AI-led transformation which is significantly more complicated as it has operational, sales, pricing, GTM, financial implications. We are optimistic about the company's strategy and messaging, and it appears that it is resonating with customers. If successful, we expect that the company's transformation as well as the influx of AI-related work could drive upside in the stock. · Global repositioning of headcount: As a result of the war in Ukraine, much of EPAM's Eastern European headcount has moved further west into Europe or has been replaced in other geos like India or in Latin America. Investors have met the geographical repositioning with mixed sentiment, however, if headcount shifting does not negatively impact margins and does not affect the company's ability to service clients, then we expect EPAM to be rewarded in time and for the stock to reflect the positive change.

· Arkadiy Dobkin serves as EPAM's Executive Chairman where he is actively involved in shaping EPAM's long-term strategic direction, maintaining key relationships with clients, partners, and investors, providing guidance on critical strategic initiatives, and promoting the Company's brand worldwide. · From EPAM's inception in 1993 until September 2025, Dobkin served as EPAM's CEO, President, and Chairman of the Board. Dobkin is widely considered to have played a pivotal role in opening the Central and Eastern European software-talent pool to the global business community. He holds a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Belarusian National Technical University.

· Balazs Fejes serves as the CEO and President of EPAM (since September of 2025). Before being appointed as CEO, Fejes served as EPAM's President of Global Business and Chief Revenue Officer. During his more than 20-year tenure with EPAM, he has held a number of other senior roles, including President of the Europe and APAC Markets, co-led global business operations, and oversaw EPAM's banking and financial services business unit. Fejes also served as Chief Technology Officer (CTO). · Fejes joined EPAM in 2004 as part of the acquisition of Fathom Technology, a Hungarian software engineering firm he co-founded, where he also served as CTO. Prior to cofounding Fathom Technology, he held senior technical leadership roles at Great Plains (Microsoft Business Solutions) and Scala Business Solutions.

· Jason Peterson serves as Chief Financial Officer, SVP and Treasurer at EPAM, where he leads the company's global finance, corporate development, and procurement organizations. Prior to joining EPAM in 2017, he held multiple leadership roles in financial planning and analysis; merger and acquisition diligence and integration; and financial process transformation at Cognizant Technology Solutions. · Before that, Peterson served as Chief Financial Officer for E&C Medical Intelligence, a venture-backed software and services company, and in various accounting and finance roles at ATI Technologies, Philips Semiconductors, Silicon Graphics, and Hewlett-Packard. He holds an MBA from Columbia Business School and a bachelor's degree in economics from Claremont McKenna College. Source: Truist Securities, Company Reports, LinkedIn

We rate EPAM shares Hold. We view EPAM as an improving, but in-transition IT Services company. Growth is still subdued, but improving; AI investments are driving incremental wins, and valuation is pressured given missteps in guidance and execution. Additionally, continued progress toward scaling its GenAI business could make us more constructive on the stock.

Our $220 price target is based on 17.5x our FY26E EPS. We derive our 17.5x multiple assumption given that while we see moderate expansion from current levels on the back of secular AI tailwinds, we believe that a discount to ACN (Buy), for which we apply a multiple of 23.0x to our FY26E EPS to value ACN shares, is warranted until company's pressured pricing dynamics begin to ease, and until we see proof points of successful integration of recent large M&A. Upside risks to our rating and price target include potential for AI uplift and the completion and potential benefit of its geographic repositioning efforts. Downside risks to our rating and price target include macroeconomic headwinds and pricing challenges.
