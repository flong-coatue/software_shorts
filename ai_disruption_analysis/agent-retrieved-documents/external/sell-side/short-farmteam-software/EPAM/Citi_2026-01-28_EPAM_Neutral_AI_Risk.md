william1.tang@citi.com +1-212-816-8743 Adam Butler, CFA adam.butler@citi.com +1-212-816-5181 Sections: Data Summary Flagship | MustC | Risk & Adaptation Investment Strategies | | Innovation Lab | Super-Sector Analysis | CITI'S TAKE Given the recent rally in the IT Services sector, expectations are rising for accelerating growth in FY26 (although we see growth remaining below industry norms). We see the main thematic trends for both IT Service leaders to be centered around demand (potential signs of discretionary spend recovery), delivering positive growth from GenAI solutions (offsetting pricing pressure), prudent expense control and slight margin expansion. We expect EPAM to modestly improve organic growth in FY26, while we estimate GLOB’s organic growth to stabilize in the low single digits.

For FY26, we are estimating EPAM to guide to 5%-7% Y/Y organic cc rev growth, a 15%-16% adj. op. margin, and $12.30-$12.70 adj. EPS, and see GLOB guiding to 0%-3% Y/Y organic cc rev growth, a 14.5%-15.5% adj. op. margin and $6.20-$6.60 adj. EPS. We remain Neutral on EPAM and set a new $225 TP, and Neutral/HR on GLOB with a new $72 TP. Organic Revenue Growth Outlook. Organic Rev Growth Tailwinds for EPAM into FY26.

We believe EPAM is adapting to AI-native emerging technology demand well, with organic cc rev growth picking up over the past four quarters (+1.0% Y/Y in 4Q24, +1.4% in 1Q25, +5.3% in 2Q25 and +7.1% in 3Q25). For 4Q25, EPAM guided to +11.1% Y/Y rev growth and raised its outlook for FY25 to +15.0% (+13%-15% prior). Given EPAM’s 4Q guide for an inorganic rev growth contribution of 4.3% and a 2.4% positive FX impact, guidance implies 4.4% Y/Y and 4.5% Y/Y organic cc rev growth for 4Q and FY25, respectively. In addition, EPAM expects its organic rev growth to be stronger in FY26 (vs. FY25) due primarily to foundational AI-related build outs the company has been executing on and the pipeline for next year building “very nicely”.

While 2025 saw sequentially sustained quarterly easing in organic Y/Y revenue growth (+8.6% in 1Q, +1.0% in 2Q, +0% in 3Q, and -7.3% guided for 4Q), we think that management’s remarks surrounding growing signs of stability in 4Q could imply a potential troughing of growth, setting the stage for acceleration across 2026 (we model ~+3%). Additionally, while the sequential change from 4Q24 to 1Q25 resulted in a -4.9% Q/Q change in revenues, management highlighted several times on the 3Q25 earnings call that the 4Q25 to 1Q26 change should be much less drastic, given the pronounced degree of furloughs for 4Q work paired with the increased stability GLOB was seeing in terms of pipeline buildup ($3.7 bln, up 30% Y/Y in 3Q25) and faster conversion timelines. Headcount and Rev/Head Outlook. Steady Headcount Building at EPAM.

EPAM’s total headcount has grown at a 0.5%-0.8% quarterly pace in the first 3 quarters of 2025 (to 62.4K as of 9/30) after a 14.9% Q/Q increase in 4Q24 with EPAM’s late 2024 close of both NEORIS and First Derivative. We believe EPAM continued adding headcount in 4Q25 at a similar cadence to the prior three quarters as further global additions are offset by some “pockets of excess bench” where EPAM continues to find efficiencies. EPAM is placing a greater emphasis on upskilling and hiring engineers with training and backgrounds aligned with the company’s AI-led future, and expects overall headcount to continue rising as GenAI grows in prominence. Rev per Head Should Trend Higher.

Despite the growing non-linearity of Rev/Head growth across the IT services industry with the impact of GenAI, we believe EPAM’s relatively strong organic growth outlook, coupled with ongoing client profitability recalibrations, expectations for low-single-digit pricing increases in FY26 and a focus on more productive hires, should lead to Rev/Head growth in the mid-to-upper mid-single-digit range through FY26. GLOB Headcount Potentially Stabilizing.

After 3 consecutive quarters of mild sequential headcount rebalancing (3Q25 heads of ~29K vs a peak of ~31K in 4Q24, delta of -7%), we believe that management sounds cautiously optimistic about the go-forward, seeing several reasons for stability and even a possible troughing. For example, “one large customer” that was contributing to furloughs in 4Q appears to have stabilized by the time of the 3Q25 earnings call in mid-November, and “two or three others” were causing growth to help offset. Additionally, outside of Professional Services (e.g. Media and Entertainment, or BFSI, etc.), GLOB reported seeing general stability heading into the holiday season. Rev/Head Steady

, But Room for Expansion? We believe that GLOB has historically demonstrated strong pricing power, which we track via the proxy revenue/headcount, and we would emphasize that growth in that metric has continued despite the proliferation of GenAI technologies in the industry at large. Although there has been some moderation in the magnitude of growth (~5% across 2024 vs ~1.5% in the first 3 quarters of 2025), we think that GLOB could maintain expansion and potentially expand growth to ~3.5% in 2026. Adj. Operating Income and Operating Margin Commentary. EPAM Executing on Margin Expansion Initiatives.

EPAM’s adj. operating income was flat Y/Y in 3Q25 (vs. +3.9% and +6.2% in 2Q25 and 1Q25, respectively) despite higher variable compensation in 3Q and the lower profitability associated with recent M&As. EPAM guided toward an adj. operating margin of 15.5%-16.5% in 4Q25 (vs. 16.0% in 3Q25) and 15.0%-15.3% in FY25 (vs. 16.5% in FY24). Management is focused on rebalancing its offerings, particularly in its newer geographies through M&A, selecting the right clients, and spoke to better Y/Y pricing in 3Q25 that management expects to improve modestly entering FY26, all of which we believe should lead to adj. op. margin expansion in FY26. GLOB Looking for Margin Stability.

GLOB demonstrated improved profitability in the 3Q, with an adj. op. margin of 15.5% (-14 bps Y/Y and +50 bps Q/Q), which was supported by a 20bps sequential dilution in SG&A expense as well as flattish sequential adj. gross profit margins at 38.1% despite significant FX headwinds from currencies in LatAm. GLOB guided toward an adj. op. margin of at least 15% in both 4Q25 and FY25 and reiterated a concerted focus on maintaining or improving margins going forward even as peers compete margins down. GLOB importantly does not expect significant pricing pressure going forward as it believes it will be able to continue pricing products efficiently for the value their products and services create for customers. GenAI-Related Developments. EPAM’s Unified AI Strategy and Focus on AI-Ready Base.

EPAM’s pure AI-native revenues grew in the double digits for the third consecutive quarter in 3Q25. The demand environment for EPAM continues to improve as it increases investments to support its differentiated AI playbook, which includes its recent launch of a unified AI strategy to better activate its go-to-market initiatives. EPAM’s two key offerings include AI Innovation Business Transformation and AI-Native Engineering Transformation, with tools such as EPAM DIAL, the AI/RUN platform, EPAM’s existing AI/data/cloud ecosystem, and Agentic QA. According to management, Agentic QA enables clients to move faster by automating manual testing, and is shown to be 10x more efficient, reduce manual efforts by 50%, reduce testing costs by 30%, and cover 90% of manual checks. We also view EPAM’s AI upskilling/hiring and focus on further global delivery optimization as ways to further support and enhance solutions, and believe they could ultimately position the company to capture greater market demand. The vast majority of EPAM’s headcount is AI-ready with 90%+ of EPAMers having completed their AI literacy education, and 95%+ of its engineers have completed their “foundational AI education” YTD, according to the company.

GLOB’s AI Pod Model Juicing the Pipeline. AI-related initiatives have become a central engine behind GLOB’s pipeline, and the company’s subscription-based AI Pods model is another example of how the IT services industry is evolving its go-to-market approach related to AI-enabled products and services from traditional consulting engagements to outcome-based models. The AI Pod pipeline doubled its share within GLOB’s total pipeline in 3Q25 (900+ AI-related projects in its pipeline at 9/30), the company is embedding the AI Pod offering among its top customers (17 of the top 20 at 9/30), and in 3Q GLOB had 1,000 active Gen AI/Core AI engagements representing approximately one-third of all projects at the company. GLOB also continues

to invest in its AI Studios offering, which helps customers by providing industry-specific AI-based solutions. GLOB’s AI-related offerings are all orchestrated through its central intelligence platform, Globant Enterprise AI, which connects customers with over 140 LLMs. We believe GLOB’s unique go-to-market AI strategy is resonating with customers, and we expect traction to continue to build as the company executes on its 100-squared strategy (objective of identifying and serving 100 clients each generating $100M+ in ARR). Geographic and Vertical Related Trends and M&A. EPAM’s Organic Growth Strongest in Software/High-Tech.

By region, EPAM’s organic cc revs in 3Q grew 14.2% Y/Y in APAC (2% of 3Q revenue), 11.8% in EMEA (40%), and 3.9% in the Americas (58%), with the latter remaining impacted by political/economic uncertainty and NEORIS’s largest client. By vertical, the acquisitions of NEORIS and First Derivative should continue to have an outsized contribution to EPAM’s revenue growth with Emerging Verticals (+38.9% Y/Y in 3Q25; +15.1% Y/Y organic cc growth) and Financial Services (+32.7% Y/Y in 3Q25; +6% Y/Y organic cc growth) during the 4Q. The Software and High-Tech vertical has been EPAM’s strongest organic grower (+19.1% Y/Y in 3Q) lately, driven by execution and improvement among its large clients, followed by Life Sciences and Healthcare (+11.8% Y/Y in 3Q25), Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel (+9.9% Y/Y in 3Q25), where performance has rebounded from earlier in the year, and Business Information and Services (flat Y/Y in 3Q25).

GLOB’s Geographic Considerations Remain Fluid. With GLOB’s major geographic region of North America (54% of total revenues) slowing to -3% Y/Y growth in 3Q25 (vs +0.4% in 2Q), and Latin America (~20% of total revenues) still down (-8.5% Y/Y vs -10.5% in 2Q), we think there are elements of a “show-me story” embedded in the company’s investment narrative. The silver lining, however, lies in Europe (19% of total revenues), with growth still resilient at +10.7% Y/Y (vs +21.2% in 2Q). Vertical Demand Snapshot.

Recent quarters have suggested that the Media & Entertainment (20% of total) and Technology & Communications (9% of total) verticals have encountered more conservative demand, with revenues from both falling -10.9% Y/Y and -12.7% Y/Y, respectively, in 3Q25. But sectors like Travel & Hospitality (13% of total, up +15.6% Y/Y) and BFSI (20% of total, up +15.6% Y/Y) have continued to grow, albeit at moderating rates. Our Expectations for EPAM and GLOB’s FY26 Guides.

In-line with expectations for EPAM’s improving backdrop, we expect management’s FY26 guide to call for organic cc rev growth in the range of +5%-7% Y/Y (vs. our +6.9% Y/Y estimate), an adj. op. margin guidance range of 15%-16% (vs. our 15.6% estimate), and an adj. diluted EPS range of $12.30-$12.70 (reflecting 8%-11% Y/Y growth, and vs. our $12.48 estimate). We expect GLOB’s FY26 guide to call for organic cc rev growth in the flat to +3% Y/Y range (vs. our +2.8% estimate), an adj. op margin guidance range of 14.5%-15.5% (vs. our 15.4% estimate), and an adj. diluted EPS range of $6.20-$6.60 (reflecting 2%-8% Y/Y growth and vs. our $6.46 estimate). 4Q25 Preview: EPAM (reporting date: 2/19/26)

For 4Q25, we model organic cc rev growth of 4.4% Y/Y, an adj. op. margin of 16.1% (-58 bps Y/Y), and adj. diluted EPS of $3.12 (+9.6% Y/Y). We expect headcount to be up 2.4% Y/Y to 62.7k. We increase our TP to $225 (from $170), based on 18.0x and 16.2x our FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates. We increase our target P/E (from 13.6x FY26E and 12.3x FY27E) to reflect higher peer multiples. GLOB (reporting date: TBD) For 4Q25, we model organic cc revs -7.2%Y/Y, an adj. op. margin of 15.6% (--11 bps Y/Y), and adj. diluted EPS of $1.54 (-12% Y/Y). We expect headcount to be -7.2% Y/Y to 29.0k.

EPAM is known for its deep engineering capabilities and employs over 60k people worldwide, with experience servicing clients in the financial services, consumer goods, technology, life sciences, and healthcare verticals. EPAM is a higher-end IT services provider, and sits in a position to service cloud adoption, digital transformation and AI integration. Investment strategy We have a Neutral rating on EPAM. We view EPAM as a leading digital transformation provider, with a growing emphasis on genAI, genAI infrastructure implementation, and cloud migration. EPAM’s bench is technically sound with deep expertise. We believe EPAM represents an opportunity to investment in demand for digital transformation and higher-value IT services, as well as a growing exposure to AI-focused business transformations. However, we view EPAM’s risk-reward as fairly balanced at its current valuation. Valuation

We value EPAM based on P/E and consider both our FY26 and FY27 estimates. Our price target of $225 implies a 18.0x and 16.2x multiple on our FY26 and FY27 adjusted EPS estimates. Risks Risks to the target price include: Geopolitical and operational risks, margin and competitive pressures, and M&A integration. Globant SA Company description Globant is a global digital engineer helping companies accelerate digital transformations, with services including software engineering, AI-powered solutions, automation, and digital marketing. Globant positions itself and its capabilities at the cross-section of technology and creativity, and has 30K+ employees across 35+ countries. Globant provides IT services to clients across a broad range of verticals, including financial services, healthcare, media, retail and gaming. GLOB’s emphasis on AI pods and a subscription-style service model reflect its strategy to capture recurring revenue in digital engineering. Investment strategy

We have a Neutral / High Risk rating on GLOB. We view GLOB as a globally scaled digital engineering company that combines its technological expertise with AI and creativity. Its rollout of the AI pod model represents a reinvention of IT services delivery through a subscription model approach, and represents opportunity to invest in the new idea. While growth has been softer and execution risk is a major theme in the story, we believe its valuation is relatively balanced with the shares’ recent performance. Valuation We value GLOB based on P/E and consider both our FY26 and FY27 estimates. Our price target of $72 implies a 11.2x and 10.1x multiples on our FY26 and FY27 adjusted EPS. Risks We assign a High Risk rating to GLOB given perceived volatility due to outlook visibility, competitive and pricing pressures, and macro, FX, and headcount risks.

Data current as of 01 Jan 2026 Buy Hold Sell Buy Hold Sell Citi Research Global Fundamental Coverage (Neutral=Hold) 60% 32% 8% 37% 47% 16% % of companies in each rating category that are investment banking clients 36% 40% 28% 40% 34% 35% Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings: Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned. Investment Ratings:

Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign “Rating Suspended” status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—“ and “-“ respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned “Under Review” status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
