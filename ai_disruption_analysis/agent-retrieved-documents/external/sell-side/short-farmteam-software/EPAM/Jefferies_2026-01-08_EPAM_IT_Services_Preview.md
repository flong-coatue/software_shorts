We expect 4Q25 results to be mostly in-line to slightly better than expectations, with mgmt commentary likely reflecting stable to modestly better demand q/q. However, we see some risk to 2026 guidance relative to expectations as mgmt is likely to be a bit more conservatism post 3 difficult years. This makes the setup into 4Q tricky. Into the print, we are most comfortable with CTSH and Genpact, while our 2026 top picks in IT Services are CTSH, EPAM, and GDYN.

All eyes on the 2026 guide. Although we see 4Q numbers as generally safe, we also see little room for large beats given low probabilities around year-end budget flushes. Mgmt commentary in the quarter will likely highlight some improvement in demand, but focus a lot of more on AI and the investments being made. The need for continued investment likely limits margin expansion for the group to the +10-30 bps range. Importantly, given the limited visibility into client budgets (and how they're changing) over the past 3 years, we expect mgmt to be conservative when initiating guidance. A few guidance misses would not surprise us.

· ASGN (UNPF) -Expect 4Q results in-line with guidance, with approx flat q/q growth as adjusted for bill days. Expect 1Q guide roughly flat q/q adjusted for bill days. As a reminder, mgmt does not provide full-year guidance. · CTSH (Buy) -Anticipating another quarter of strong managed services bookings, while past large deal wins continue to ramp. Looking to hear more about potential greenshoots and anticipate a solid, but achievable, 2026 guide. · EPAM (Buy) -Anticipate solid 4Q results with positive commentary around AI-native projects and margins. Expect initial 2026 guidance to be in the range of +5-8% y/y cc, but see risk to margin guide as mgmt remains biased towards investing in AI.

· EXLS (Buy) -Expect growth to remain in the low double-digits in 4Q. Commentary around demand trends should remain positive. Anticipate a low double-digit cc revenue guide for 2026. · Genpact (Buy) -Expect 4Q results to be at or above mgmt's guidance range as we believe there is some conservatism built in. 2026 revenue growth guidance is likely to be +6-8% y/y cc. We remain Street high on 2026 revenues. · GDYN (Buy) -Expect 4Q results in-line with guidance, with commentary centering on margin expansion and AI revenues. We expect initial 2026 guidance to reflect growth of around +10-15%, or at least double-digits, with 1Q guidance close to flat to modestly positive due to fewer bill days. We are Street high on 2026 revenues and adj EPS.

· GIB (Hold) -Anticipate organic growth bottoming in F1Q on the impact of U.S. Federal shutdown. Our focus remains on bookings and backlog conversion, in addition to comments around discretionary spend and the challenging environment in Europe. · GLOB (Hold) -Expect 4Q results in-line with guidance of "at least" $605M. Commentary will likely focus on overall visibility and geopolitical uncertainty in LatAm. We expect initial 2026 guidance to reflect revenue growth of "at least" +1.0% y/y. · UIS (Hold) -Expect 4Q results in-line with guidance of down LSD y/y, with a step up in L&S due to large deals that were pushed out from 3Q. Expect initial 2026 revenue guidance to be roughly flat y/y at the midpoint. Please see back pages for a more detailed discussion of each company.

Readthroughs: ACN reports off-cycle (FYE 8/31), and most recently reported results on 12/18/2025 for the Sept-Nov quarter. Below, we review their most recent results for any insights into what to expect for the peer group this quarter (Oct-Dec) as there are two months of overlap. Our ACN estimates, which were recently updated post earnings, are unchanged in this note. Theme 1: Bookings are improving, but demand remains challenged. Mgmt noted there has been no improvement in demand this year, with large-scale transformations remaining the one bright spot. Bookings growth improved, with both Consulting (+7% y/y) and Outsourcing (+16% y/y) accelerating, but still lumpy q/q. Our sense is the overall environment has modestly improved, but we will still see discrepancies with peers due to differences in client and industry-related exposure.

Theme 2: Modest margin expansion more likely than not. ACN's headcount increased +1% q/q, while annualized attrition of 13% looked relatively normal. Regarding adj operating margins, guidance of +10-30 bps y/y expansion to 15.7-15.9% was reiterated in line with expectations. Broadly speaking, other than FX, most IT Services firms should be able to protect margins if they want to through headcount mgmt.

Theme 3: Demand for advanced AI remains strong. ACN's AI bookings were $2.2B in F1Q26, up from $1.8B in F4Q25. Q/Q growth accelerated, continuing the growth acceleration from F4Q. Mgmt noted that AI is increasingly involved in its services and clients are moving beyond standalone proofof-concept projects or initiatives. As a result, ACN will no longer provide its AI bookings number. ACN completed its business optimization program during the quarter that aimed to quickly reorient its employee base to be more focused on AI. Going forward, we expect to see similar adjustments to delivery at other IT Services firms.

F1Q estimates unchanged, F2026 raised for inorganic activity. Our F1Q26 revenue estimate is unchanged at C$4.08B (Consensus: C$4.09B) as the demand environment remains consistent and FX rates have not materially moved. At a segment level, we are modeling managed services revenues and consulting revenues of C$2.31B (+6.5% y/y) and C$1.77B (+9.5% y/y), respectively, with F1Q26 adj operating margins of 16.4% and adj EPS of C$2.17.

Our 4Q revenue estimate is unchanged at $533M (+10.4% y/y cc), but we have increased our 2026 revenue estimate by $11M to $2,331M (+12.0% y/y cc), which makes our estimate Street high. Our underlying assumption continues to be that demand for Data and AI-Led and Analytics growth remain healthy, generating double-digit growth throughout the entirety of 2026. We believe mgmt will issue 2026 revenue guidance of at least double digits ( i.e. , at least +10-12% y/y cc).

Our 4Q25 estimates for revenue and adj EPS are essentially unchanged at $974M (guide = $960-980M) and $1.18 (guide = $1.12-1.20), respectively. Organically, our updated revenue estimate translates to a decline of -4.8% y/y. For 2026, we have modestly raised our revenue estimate by $6M to $3,930M (-1.8% y/y organic, -1.1% y/y reported), reflecting a slightly better outlook for Government consulting (ECS). At a segment level, our 2026 organic revenue growth expectations are approx -10% y/y for Staffing, approx +7.0% y/y for Commercial Consulting, and approx -1.5% y/y for Government. Our 2026 adj EPS estimate increases by $0.17 to $5.00 on adj EBITDA margins of 10.8% (up from 10.6% previously). As a reminder, mgmt does not provide full-year guidance.

We expect EXLS to generate at least low-double-digit revenue and earnings growth over the medium term. Industry tailwinds should drive near-doubledigit growth in the BPO business, while rising demand for data and analytics should support segment growth returning to a mid-teen pace. A more consistent tuck-in acquisition strategy will also modestly help the topline, and margins should be biased higher as non-FTE revenues grow faster than FTE.

· Accelerating economic growth throughout the year · Organic revenue growth of LDD · Adj operating margin expand roughly 20-40 bps y/y · Inorganic revenue contributes <1% · Stable pricing power, utilization and attrition · Price target: $50 (2026E Adj EPS $2.24, P/E ratio 22.5x)

Top material issues: 1) Data Security and Systematic Risk Management. EXLS designs and manages critical processes for clients and has access to their networks. Ensuring the security of this infrastructure from cyberattacks is critical to protect the company's reputation, while minimizing disruptions to its services. 2) Employee Engagement, Diversity, and Inclusion. IT Services is a human-capital-driven business. With over 48,000 employees globally, the challenge of promoting and maintaining equality, opportunity, and respect for everyone is significant. Company targets: 1) Committed to a 25% share of leadership positions held by women by 2025 2) Reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 67% by 2035 and achieve net zero by 2045 3) Reduce water, electricity, and paper consumption per employee by 2% annually. Questions for management: 1) What is the net near-term impact on profitability from pursuing ESG targets? 2) How does greater than 25% turnover impact your ESG targets for Human Capital?

Genpact's track record of implementing seamless digital transformation projects and its reputable global brand presence are competitive advantages that will permit the company to at least grow in line with the market. Despite limited recent activity, bolt-on acquisitions are a core part of Genpact's growth mandate and should contribute to top line at a 2-3% annual pace. Financial discipline and a focus on operational efficiency will likely continue to push adj. operating margin above the industry average. Inflation and a decline in global economic activity remain the primary risks.

GDYN's enhanced global delivery model, increasingly valuable partnership strategy, and strong reputation around technology expertise should allow the company to continue growing faster than peers for the foreseeable future. The company has also taken steps to improve its cost-structure and reorient its delivery footprint, which we expect to lead to material margin expansion over time.

· Accelerating economic growth throughout the year · Organic revenue growth of LDD · Adj operating margin expands approx +200 bps y/y · Assumes no inorganic revenue contribution · Stable pricing power, utilization and attrition · Price target: $13.50 (2026E Adj EPS $0.52, P/E ratio 20x, adding in $250M in excess cash)

Top material issues: 1) Employee Engagement, Diversity, and Inclusion. IT Services is a humancapital-driven business. With over 4,900 employees globally, the challenge of promoting and maintaining equality, opportunity, and respect for everyone is significant. 2) Systematic Risk Management. GDYN designs, builds, and implements critical business systems for clients and has access to their networks. Ensuring the security of this infrastructure is critical to protecting the company's reputation and economic exposure. Company targets: The company does not disclose specific sustainability targets Questions for management: 1) Please explain the company's current lack of quantitative targets for its ESG strategy? Upside Scenario,

· No change in economic conditions in 2025, strong growth in 2026 · Mid-teens organic revenue growth · Additional M&A · Adj operating margins expand more than +250 bps y/y · Stable to improving pricing power, utilization and attrition levels · Price target: $15.00 (2026E Adj EPS $0.60, P/E ratio 25x)

CGI's geographical approach and exposure to government make it a unique provider within the IT Services market. The company's primary focus is providing positive shareholder returns through above-market growth and double-digit adj EPS appreciation. Acquisitions are part of CGI's strategy to expand its client base within the markets in which it already operates, providing a roughly mid-single-digit annual contribution. CGI maintains a bestin-class margin profile, which we expect will continue with annual incremental adj. operating margin expansion of 10-30 bps. A decline in global economic activity, primarily Europe and North America, remains the primary risk, in our view.

Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a 15% stop loss, and the remainder will have a 20% stop.
