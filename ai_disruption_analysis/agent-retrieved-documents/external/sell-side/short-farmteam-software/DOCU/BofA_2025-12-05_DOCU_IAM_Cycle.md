Price objective basis & risk DocuSign (DOCU) Our PO of $82 is based on 16x CY27E FCF or 1.9x adjusted for growth (above the GARP group trading at 21x CY27 or 1.2x adjusted for 18% growth), to reflect multiple compression across the apps group and sustaining the premium for possible growth reacceleration related to IAM. Downside risks to our PO are 1) increased competition from Adobe, 2) slower-than-expected adoption of eSignature in key end markets, 3) declines in sales productivity ratio as measured by S&M spend divided by incremental subscription revenue.

DocuSign Debate on agentic disruption is ongoing Since the demo of an agreement management agent, DocuGPT by OpenAI in September , the stock has been weighed down by agentic disruption concerns. Q3 results were not going to settle that debate, but we are encouraged by progress with DocuSign ' s Intelligence Agreement Management (IAM), which is key to fending off that threat , in our view . DocuSign reiterated the target to achieve low double digit recurring revenue mix by the end of Q4. Agree with move to ARR guide, will impact NT visibility The magnitude of the beat is always a focus for DocuSign and on that mark, the quarter was a bit light. Q3 revenue of $818.4 million (+8%) exceeded the outlook by 1%, versus the usual 2%. Billings upside has been volatile, but 5% upside (reported $828.4 million, +10% versus $790 million guide) was on the lower side of recent history. Management ' s move away from quarterly billings outlook will reduce near term visibility, though we agree with the rationale behind the focus on ARR .

FY26 margin moves higher, though still flat y/y On margin, Q3 and Q4 topline upside resulted in a raised FY26 outlook, to 29.8% versus the prior 29.1%. However , this is flat from FY25, highlighting lack of meaningful margin expansion at this level of growth. It ' s clear that without one time restructuring or a more material growth rate, ongoing margin expansion may be tough to achieve. Reiterate Neutral, look for better growth and FCF No change to our Neutral rating. We are enthusiastic about the long term opportunity for IAM, which addresses a wider TAM in applications/workflow. However, it may take some time for the business to scale, given the nascent stage of the cycle. In the near term, we are modeling lackluster 8 % to 9 % FCF growth. With the stock trading at 1 6 x CY27 FCF or 1. 9 x adjusted for growth ( above the GARP group trading at 21x CY27 or 1. 2x adjusted for 18 % growth), we believe near term upside is priced into the shares.

We fine-tune our estimates to reflect the results, and l ower our PO to $ 8 2 (now based on 16x CY27 E FCF ) from $102 (21x CY26E FCF) for multiple compression across apps .
