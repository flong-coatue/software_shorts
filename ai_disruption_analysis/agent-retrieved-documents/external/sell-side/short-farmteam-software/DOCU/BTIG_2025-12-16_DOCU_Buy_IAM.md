I-AM Docusign; Initiate at Buy, $88 PT

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Shares are now 34% off their multi-year high of $107 per share last December in what was a very noisy year for DOCU . Q1 billings missed guidance for the first time since FY22 due to lower than expected early renewals after making GTM changes, OpenAI debuted its DocuGPT agent which converts contracts into structured data, and beginning next quarter, DOCU will guide to annual ARR instead of billings. We believe each of these factors in share underperformance this year presents a great buying opportunity . First, we love that DOCU is being more transparent by guiding to the best underlying indicator of the business, which will eliminate quarterly volatility driven by timing of renewals as seen in Q1. We do not see a competitive threat with OpenAI - DOCU's IAM, its organically developed AIpowered platform that manages the entire agreement lifecycle, is trained on private data, yielding a 15ppt improvement in precision compared to models trained

on public contract data, and IAM will be available in ChatGPT, among other platforms using Model Context Protocol (MCP). IAM is expected to represent a low-doubledigit percentage of ARR next quarter and the halo effect is clear - gross retention is higher, customers that move to IAM increase their eSignature usage, and both TTM subscription revenue and TTM subscription billings accelerated to 8.8% and 9.6%, respectively. We estimate IAM can drive 170bps of subscription revenue growth next year compared to 120bps in FY26E and that subscription revenue growth can accelerate to 10% in F2Q27 . Our bull case also calls for DOCU to return to operating at the Rule of 40 next year. SBC as a % of revenue has room to come down from 20% in the MRQ while DOCU has been more than offsetting gross dilution, spending over 80% of its quarterly FCF on share repurchases over the last three quarters. We initiate coverage at Buy w/ $88 PT.

■ Improving Fundamentals . In addition to the strength in ARR proxies, in Q3, similar to Q2, DOCU observed the quality of early renewals continuing to improve on a y/y basis as the percentage of early renewals with expansion grew and the share of early renewals that were flat declined. DOCU saw elevated early renewal activity in the 2H of FY25, creating a more difficult y/y billings comparison in Q3 and Q4. Growth in number of customers with greater than $300k in ACV also accelerated for the second consecutive quarter to 8.4%.

■ Margin Expansion Taking a Back Seat to Top-Line Acceleration . After expanding non-GAAP operating margins from 20.5% in FY23 to 29.8% in FY25, margins are expected to finish flat in FY26 as DOCU made the necessary investments this year to successfully accelerate growth. We see room for DOCU's SBC to come down -if DOCU's SBC per employee was in line with the peer median (detailed inside), DOCU's CY24 SBC expense would have been ~$425M (14% of revenue) compared to $612M (21% of revenue).

■ Docusign's AI Advantage vs. LLMs . DOCU's key advantages vs. LLMS include 1) contract-specific data which gives DOCU a 15ppt improvement in precision, 2) a platform with embedded workflows and a complete audit trail, 3) enterprise-grade security and compliance for over 87% of the Fortune 1000 and the U.S. Federal Government, and 4) scalability to fine-tune AI models that handle hundreds of millions of agreements efficiently. ■ Valuation: Our $88 PT is based on 17x CY27E EV/FCF. This is in line with the median of single-digit CY26E revenue growth peers. December 16, 2025

DocuSign shares, now 34% below last December's multi-year high, offer a compelling buying opportunity following a noisy year marked by GTM shifts, billing volatility, and competitive headlines. DocuSign's organically built IAM AI platform, which yields a 15ppt precision improvement versus public contract-trained models, is driving an accelerating halo effect-boosting retention, customer expansion, and subscription revenue growth, with IAM expected to reach low-double-digit ARR contribution next quarter. We view DOCU's guidance transition to annual ARR as materially improving transparency and eliminating quarterly volatility fueled by renewal timing. With subscription growth set to accelerate toward 10% in F2Q27 in our bull case, improving high-value client metrics, and meaningful buybacks, we initiate coverage at Buy ($88 PT), emphasizing DOCU's superior AI differentiation, robust fundamentals, and an operating model poised to return to Rule of 40 next year.

Docusign's IAM platform automates agreement workflows, uncovers actionable insights, and leverages AI capabilities, enabling organizations to create, commit, and manage agreements, from virtually anywhere in the world, securely.

Our Take: In our bull case scenario, we are modeling subscription revenue growth accelerating to 10% in F2Q27 and growing 10% in FY27 . On the back of strength in IAM, projected to represent a low-doubledigit percentage of ARR exiting Q4 (vs. low-single-digit in F4Q25), we highlight that in Q3, our calculated TTM current subscription billings growth accelerated for the second consecutive quarter to +9.6% Y/Y . Despite DOCU's prudent guidance approach regarding early renewals, we are further upbeat that DOCU has now guided to a quarterly CC billings growth rate higher than the prior quarter for two consecutive quarters . DOCU guided to CC billings growth of 6.4% / 4.8% / 4.5% / 6.1% in Q4 / Q3 / Q2 / Q1 of FY26. TTM subscription revenue growth also accelerated to 8.8% compared to 8.5% in Q2. We also estimate with IAM ramping that it can provide

a 170bps tailwind to subscription revenue growth in FY27 compared to an estimated 120bps tailwind in FY26 .

There has been a lot of noise in quarterly billings driven by renewal timing as evidenced by DOCU's quarterly CC billings growth coming in 190bps below / 740bps above / 490bps above the midpoint of DOCU's CC billings growth guidance in Q1 / Q2 / Q3 of FY26. DOCU shares sold off 7% T+1 after DOCU reported Q3 earnings as investors digested several moving pieces: - ▪ Billings outperformance was primarily driven by renewal timing / early renewal strength and a collection of smaller impacts, including a small shift in payment frequency to annual bookings performance. This is a change from Q2's billings outperformance drivers which included strength in direct customer demand and improved gross retention in DOCU's eSignature portfolio. - ▪ DOCU will no longer report billings in FY27 and instead disclose annual recurring revenue (including historical data for recent years) along with IAM as a percentage of ARR .

In addition to the strength in ARR proxies highlighted above, in Q3, similar to Q2, DOCU observed the quality of early renewals continuing to improve on a Y/Y basis as the percentage of early renewals with expansion grew and the share of early renewals that were flat, declined. Despite the Q3 billings outperformance primarily driven by early renewals and duration, Q4 CC billings growth expectations increased to 6.2% Y/Y vs. 5.7% Y/Y previously . DOCU saw elevated early renewal activity in the 2H of FY25, creating a more difficult Y/Y billings comparison in Q3 and Q4. The growth in the number of customers with greater than $300k in ACV also accelerated for the second consecutive quarter to 8.4%.

Removing and introducing new metrics presents noise, but is, in our opinion, very worthwhile to get the holy grail of disclosures, ARR. We view DOCU's incremental transparency to disclose ARR beginning next quarter positively. Consensus is modeling FY27E subscription revenue of $3.36B (7.0%). We believe this is appropriately prudent as this would suggest DOCU could have room to beat a potential initial subscription revenue guide of $3.36B by $110 million - this compares to our bull case suggesting DOCU will beat its initial FY25 subscription revenue guide by $88 million.

Investing to accelerate growth. After expanding non-GAAP operating margins from 20.5% in FY23 to 29.8% in FY25, margins are expected to finish flat in FY26 as DOCU made the necessary investments this year to accelerate growth. DOCU was successful in doing that as TTM subscription revenue growth as of Q3 is 8.8%, up from 8.0% in F4Q25. In addition to a ~1ppt headwind to gross margins due to cloud data center migration efforts, DOCU also faces a tough compare against the F2Q25 one-time release of a litigation reserve and the FY26 shift of some roles to cash compensation vs. equity. With our bull case calling for more subscription revenue growth acceleration next year, we see DOCU continuing to prioritize investments to drive growth towards double-digits. Therefore, we do not see DOCU expanding non-GAAP operating margins in FY28 by more than 160bps. We believe that DOCU can steadily expand non-GAAP operating margins

beyond 35%+.

Over the past couple of quarters, DOCU has been growing its headcount by 4% on a Y/Y basis which ties with the company's top-line growth investments. After conducting several layoffs between 2022-2024, DOCU's current headcount of 6,940 is now 14% below its peak in F2Q23 of 8,061 employees. DOCU's current headcount suggests CY24 revenue of $454k per employee, 16% higher than the median of horizontal software companies in our coverage and CY24 non-GAAP operating expenses of $243k per employee, 5% above the median. However, as illustrated below, DOCU's SBC expenses on a per employee basis in CY24 of $92k were 44% above the median. If DOCU's SBC per employee was in line with the peer median of $64k per employee, then DOCU's CY24 SBC expense would have been ~$425M (14% of revenue) compared to $612M (21% of revenue). Looking

at SBC as a percentage of revenue, the median for the peer group is 15%.

Source: BTIG Research Estimates, Company Reports DOCU has hired a number of new executives since Allan Thygesen started as CEO in October 2022 including: ▪ January 2023 - Robert Chatwani as President & General Manager, Growth and Anwar Akram as COO ▪ May 2023 - Blake Grayson as CFO ▪ June 2024 - Paula Hansen as President and CRO and Sagnik Nandy as CTO ▪ March 2025 - Bronwyn Hastings as Group Vice President of Global Partners and Alliances ▪ April 2025 - Michael Adams as CISO Despite the amount of executive hiring DOCU has done, SBC has been relatively flat in FY26 and FY25 on a dollar basis, and we estimate SBC as a percentage of revenue will finish the year at 19.4% compared to 22.3% in FY24. We have no reason to believe DOCU can't get to 14% of revenue being spent on SBC over time, suggesting DOCU can reach 20%+ GAAP operating margins.

As highlighted below, we estimate DOCU's NTM gross share dilution has been trending ~5%.

Share repurchases . Management noted that it has slightly increased the pace of its buyback activity, effectively redeploying the bulk of its quarterly FCF generation back to shareholders. For context, we highlight the history of DOCU's board authorizations for the company's stock repurchase program below: ▪ March 2022: $200 million ▪ September 2023: $300 million ▪ May 2024: $1 billion ▪ May 2025: $1 billion DOCU's share repurchases have been more than offsetting gross share dilution, which we estimate has been ~5%. In Q3, DOCU increased the pace of its buyback activity, repurchasing $215M in shares, which was the company's largest quarterly dollar buyback in the company's history. DOCU will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares with over $1B in remaining buyback authorization.

DOCU shares traded off as much as 12% on 9/30 following OpenAI's video release of DocuGPT, an internal agent at OpenAI that converts contracts into structured, searchable data. DocuGPT works in three steps: ▪ Ingest data : PDFs, scanned copies, even phone photos marked up with handwritten edits. What used to be dozens of inconsistent files now flow into one pipeline. ▪ Inference with prompting : Using retrieval-augmented prompting, the system parses contracts into structured data. It doesn't dump a thousand pages into context; it pulls only what's relevant, reasons against it, and shows its work. ▪ Review : Finance experts review the structured output, complete with annotations and references for any non-standard terms. The agent highlights what's unusual; humans are then looped into review.

Siddharth Jain, an AI Engineer at OpenAI, shared that 'We're not just parsing, we're reasoning - showing why a term is considered non-standard, citing the reference material, and letting the reviewer confirm the ASC 606 classification.' While general-purpose LLMs can handle basic contractual tasks like summarization, true contract management demands a platform that is trained on rich, diverse, and consented contract datasets that integrate with systems of work and deliver enterprise-grade security, scalability, and trust. We do not believe general-purpose models like those by OpenAI or DocuGPT pose a competitive threat to DOCU . In October, DOCU announced that IAM will be available in ChatGPT, and can also connect to Anthropic

Claude, Gemini Enterprise, GitHub Copilot, Copilot Studio, and Agentforce, all using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in beta. By bringing DOCU into ChatGPT, DOCU's advanced agreement AI will be used to create, sign, and manage contracts in a seamless ChatGPT experience. Girancarlo 'GC' Lionetti, Chief Commercial Officer at OpenAI, shared 'By connecting Docusign to ChatGPT, we are helping teams move from conversation to agreement in fewer steps, reducing busywork, speeding up decisions, and giving people time back to focus on what matters. It is a great example of how AI-driven companies like Docusign are bringing core workflows into ChatGPT to run faster, smarter, and more automated.' Therefore, users can say things like:

▪ Docusign, draft a residential lease for a one-year house rental in Dallas using our standard template. Monthly rent $2,000. ▪ Create a purchase order for 10 50-pound bags of flour from our supplier and send it for signature. ▪ Find all vendor contracts with a value over $10,000 that expire in the next 90 days and draft a letter of intent to renegotiate these contracts. Below, we highlight Docusign's AI advantage against LLMs. 1. Contract-specific data . DOCU's platform is trained on a rich, diverse library of consented private agreements, covering a variety of contract types, clauses, customer segments, languages, and verticals. DOCU estimates its data advantage can deliver 15%-point improvement in precision and recall compared to its models trained on public contract data, helping teams analyze agreements faster and with greater confidence.

2. Connected platform advantage: embedded workflows and 1000+ active integrations . DOCU's platform captures the full history of every version, redline, and comment for a complete audit trail. IAM is a platform that connects to the applications where people do work: CRM for Sales (Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Hubspot), ERP for Procurement (SAP, Coupa), HRM for HR (Workday, SAP Successfactors), and many other functional and vertical apps. DOCU has more than 1,000 active integrations and enterprise-ready APIs that help connect the agreement process directly into existing tools. IAM embeds AI functionality into these existing systems and workflows, allowing Iris to access the history of how the agreement was drafted and negotiated, enable automation of existing workflows through AI agents and other automation, and connect agreements to outcomes.

3. Trust advantage: enterprise-grade security and compliance . Docusign consistently meets the stringent security requirements of even the most security-conscious organizations, including the world's largest financial institutions, the U.S. Federal Government, and the more than 87% of Fortune 1000 companies that use Docusign. Docusign leverages 20 years of experience and is trusted by more than 1.7 million customers to manage their contracts. 4. Scalability advantage: processing millions of contracts . Docusign has fine-tuned its AI models to handle hundreds of millions of agreements efficiently, giving customers speed and accuracy without ballooning costs. Enterprise customers reported 75% faster contracting cycles and a 77% improvement in risk mitigation in agreement management processes.

Docusign's April 2024 announcement of IAM was significant for several reasons. This represented a new SaaS category , expanding the company strategy and opportunity well beyond what it has been primarily known for which is eSignature. According to a study from Deloitte, nearly $2 trillion dollars are lost in

global economic value each year due to poor agreement management practices and systems. It is a bit puzzling how the $2 trillion dollars was calculated, but we do not disagree that this is a large new opportunity for DOCU to go after. DOCU calls this the Agreement Trap , which happens when outdated agreement systems and processes slow a business down and trap business-critical information inside static, flat files, unconnected to existing systems of record. For instance, agreements (contracts, NDAs, procurement forms, renewals, HR docs) are scattered across email, shared drives, CRMs, and file cabinets. Therefore, making them hard to find, they do not connect to workflows, and do not give insights until it's too late (missed renewals, bad terms, compliance risks).

What is IAM? IAM is Docusign's platform layer that organizes, understands, and manages agreements end-to-end. Much like a central nervous system for agreements, instead of contracts being static PDFs, they become structured, searchable, and connected business assets. DOCU's new capabilities seamlessly connect different components of the agreement management process and leverage AI to speed up contract creation, enhance negotiations, and provide strategic insights to manage a customer's agreement portfolio. There are three distinct parts in the whole agreement journey: ▪ Create : where agreements take shape, where they're drafted, designed, and prepared for collaboration. ▪ Commit : tools to get the agreement executed which includes signature, identity verification, data validation, compliance, and a notary. ▪ Manage : where customers learn from agreements, generating insights, but also having an easier time managing their business. This platform release came with many features including:

▪ Navigator is a smart repository that enables organizations to centrally store, manage, and analyze agreements from any source. Powered by Iris, Docusign's AI engine which we detail in the next section, transforms unstructured agreements into structured data. With this data unlocked, Navigator makes it easy to find agreements, access vital information quickly, and gain valuable insights from agreements. ▪ Maestro helps create flexible, customizable agreement workflows that are fine-tuned to a customer's needs without needing to write a single line of code. This lets customers design stepby-step processes: who needs to review, approve, sign, and what happens after signing.

▪ App Center builds upon DOCU's ecosystem of developers and partners so customers can easily discover, install, and connect a wide variety of apps to integrate existing systems into Docusign IAM. This is an important capability as agreements do not just exist in Docusign - they power downstream workflows in CRM, ERP, HRIS, etc. For example, a contract signed in Docusign automatically updates Salesforce with deal size, pushes billing terms into NetSuite, and syncs vendor compliance data into SAP .

DOCU offers preconfigured applications such as IAM Core, IAM for Customer Experience, IAM for Sales, and Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM). CLM continues to be a top choice for enterprise customers with sophisticated enterprise workflows . It also has functionality for advanced workflows and AI that goes well beyond what DOCU built into the baseline IAM platform. This involves complex authoring features, templates, advanced compliance and governance capabilities, customized workflows, and legacy integrations. Larger enterprise companies may use CLM primarily as a tool for contract creation and compliance. Since IAM was released, DOCU has been rapidly releasing new functionality: - ▪ In Q1 relaunched Partner program to align partners with IAM strategy and build solutions with IAM that deliver value to customers. Largest deal in Q2 was transacted through the Microsoft Azure marketplace. New partnership with the US GSA creates opp to expand eSig sales to federal agencies, with IAM to follow.

How is IAM monetized? DOCU sells IAM plans across multiple tiers: Starter, Standard, Professional, and Enhanced plans which come with eSignature. With DOCU targeting IAM to represent a low-double-digit percentage share of total subscription recurring revenue book of business by Q4, it's important to note two things: (1) book of business is a proxy for ARR and (2) if for example, $1,000 of eSignature spend went to $1,400 of IAM spend, then IAM book of business would be the full $1,400, not the $400 uplift. The annual plan for IAM tiers are priced as follows: ▪ IAM Starter: $40/month per user, compared to eSignature Personal for $10/month per user ▪ IAM Standard: $45/month per user, compared to eSignature Standard Unlimited for $25/month per user ▪ IAM Professional: $75/month per user, compared to eSignature Business Pro Unlimited for $40/month per user

This past April, DOCU enabled its larger direct customers to be able to add more capacity and renew their contracts via self-serve. We also observed DOCU's pricing page for IAM change in April as Standard was previously $35/month per user (vs. $45) and Professional was $65/month per user (vs. $75). The Starter plan for $40/month per user was also not previously available with the cheapest plan previously available being Standard for $35/month per user. Since the initial release of IAM, DOCU has introduced numerous incremental features and provided targeted disclosures regarding its contribution to new business. We highlight important quotes around IAM since the platform release below:

o On May 30, Docusign IAM launched with availability for our small and mid-market customers in the US, with select plans also available in Canada and Australia . o With regard to capital allocation, we also closed the Lexion acquisition on May 31st. Lexion's technology will accelerate our AI-powered IAM roadmap and Lexion's founders and team will help strengthen our technical foundation with their AI-industry leadership experience. In terms of financials, Lexion will not have a material impact on revenue and non-GAAP operating margins in fiscal 2025, and the financial impact is reflected in our current fiscal 2025 guidance.

o In Q2, IAM launched to small and mid-sized commercial customers in United States, Canada, and Australia. So far, IAM customer win rates are higher, average deal sizes are larger, and time to close with customers is faster. o Lastly, IAM enablement across our salesforce was a key priority in Q2. In Q3, the remaining teams in our salesforce will complete IAM training and certification, including our enterprise-focused teams and teams outside the initial launch markets.

o We recognize that it's early days in the multiyear IAM journey, but we believe we've taken strong initial steps on the path towards our aspiration to achieve sustainable, long-term double-digit growth . o In November, we began making IAM available for department-level use cases for enterprise customers. o In Q3, we accelerated the rollout of Docusign IAM, and gained traction with small and midsized customers in the United States, Canada, and Australia. o In Q3, we closed more than 10 times as many IAM deals as we did in Q2 , with deal volume increasing every month in the quarter. 80% of our reps eligible to sell IAM in the initial launch markets have closed three or more deals, and nearly 60% have sold six or more . o Early renewals drove approximately one-third of the billings outperformance, with the remainder coming from better retention performance, digital growth, and early IAM contributions.

o At the end of the year, we launched departmental-level deployments to enterprise customers, while also opening up IAM availability globally . o In Q4, just the second quarter post launch to our small and midmarket customers, IAM represented a high-single-digit percentage of in-quarter deal volume for the direct channel and over 20% of direct new customer deals . o In our direct sales channel, we have strong IAM momentum with small- and medium-sized customers. This segment represents a large opportunity for growth and customer impact in fiscal 2026, and it's where we expect the majority of near-term sales and adoption. o In April, our larger direct customers will be able to add more capacity and renew their contracts via self-serve, and soon after, we'll unlock the ability for new and existing customers to buy. IAM Standard and Professional plans directly from Docusign.com in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the UK and Australia.

o In Q4, a high-single-digit percentage of direct customer deal volume included IAM representing a low-single-digit percentage share of our total subscription recurring revenue book of business . We expect this IAM contribution to grow this fiscal year and anticipate it representing a low-double-digit percentage share of our total subscription recurring revenue book of business by Q4 of fiscal 2026 .

o Attendance at our Momentum conference in April grew by 70% over last year , with notable increases in partner attendance and executive-level participation. o At Momentum, we shared our robust IAM platform vision and introduced a deep lineup of new AI-powered capabilities across the Create, Commit, and Manage agreement lifecycle. Within Create, Agreement Desk provides powerful workflow management for agreement reviews and approvals, streamlining tedious processes to accelerate deal cycles. AIAssisted Review compares contract language to a customer's existing standard terms and identifies non-compliant or high-risk language, eliminating the need to review hundreds of contracts. And Agreement Prep standardizes terms and templates, applying the right language to every agreement to reduce risk. Within Commit, Workspaces transform how customers collaborate with contracting counterparties by centralizing all documents, communications, and tasks in a secure hub, while protecting sensitive data. CLEAR Identity Verification will integrate CLEAR's biometric identity network with IAM, making ID

verification as simple as snapping a selfie. Within Manage, Custom Extractions for Docusign Navigator uses AI to automatically capture the data that matters most to customers, such as organization-specific agreement information or client-specific terms. Instead of spending hours or even days on manual review, customers get instant actionable insights. The Obligation Management Dashboard transforms a company's scattered commitments into intelligence by surfacing renewal dates, payment terms, and other obligations, helping maximize contract value and avoid penalties. AI-Assisted Review, Workspaces, and Obligation Management are available today . Most of the other capabilities will be available by August.

o In Q1, IAM sales once again exceeded our outlook, and we remain on track for IAM to account for a double-digit percentage of our subscription book of business exiting Q4 . Q1 direct customer IAM deal volume exceeded Q4, and we saw another significant increase in the percentage of new customers choosing IAM . International IAM deals were up over 50% from the last quarter , confirming the IAM value proposition resonates with customers worldwide. o The launch of self-serve in April resulted in nearly 1,000 new IAM customers within just three weeks , all through organic adoption prior to the release of any marketing campaigns. o We continue to expect dollar net retention to moderately improve throughout the year based on both gross retention improvement and IAM upsell impact.

o IAM's share of total direct deal volume , including upsell deals and new customer deals, increased meaningfully quarter-over-quarter , showing strength versus typical Q4 to Q1 business seasonality. This strength is underscored by passing 10,000 direct IAM customers in Q1 , adding nearly 1,000 new IAM self-serve customers within weeks of launching that capability, and the strong early ramp in international sales. Through Q1, we are on track for IAM customers to contribute a low-double digit percentage of the subscription book of business exiting Q4 .

o In Q2, customers moving to the IAM platform represented a greater share of direct deal volume and total gross bookings than in Q1. We're also finding that when customers move to IAM, they increase their eSignature usage. o In Q2, we also saw encouraging demand for IAM from enterprise customers. While still early days, more than 50% of our enterprise account reps closed at least one IAM deal during the quarter. o IAM sales maintained strong momentum this quarter, which slightly outpaced our expectations as we continue to scale the platform. In Q2, we saw an increase in average IAM customer deal size, an encouraging sign, as we took the first steps up-market with the IAM enterprise ramp . We remain on track for IAM customers to contribute a low-doubledigit percentage share of the subscription book of business exiting Q4.

o IAM is on track for strong growth, set to be a low-double-digit share of recurring subscription revenue by Q4 . o International markets are a bright spot… Appetite for IAM is rising worldwide , reflected by Momentum event attendance tripling over last year. o DOCU rolled out major new IAM features like Agreement Desk (for internal workflows), beta AI contract agents, and new APIs to connect Navigator and Maestro into customer systems . The company also announced IAM will work with ChatGPT and other AI via the new Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, currently in beta. o IAM is now managing hundreds of millions of agreements, averaging more than 5,000 active contracts per new IAM customer . Document ingestion volumes in Navigator increased about 140% over the past two quarters. o Customer retention rose by 2 points year-over-year to 102%, driven by steady IAM adoption and broader platform use.

What is Iris? It is the AI engine that powers IAM and AI features across the agreement lifecycle. It has an expert-level understanding of complex agreement workflows and language, giving it the ability to provide users with comprehensive insights. Here is how Iris stands out from other AI platforms:

▪ Exclusive agreement datasets : Unlike a generic LLM, Iris draws from Docusign processing hundreds of millions of agreements annually across industries. This includes capturing agreement metadata such as how contracts are structured (fields, clauses, workflows, signers, approvals). Therefore, Iris knows exactly what matters in a contract (renewals, risks, compliance, obligations). ▪ Data that stays in your control : A customer's agreements and contract data do not get fed into a general-purpose large language model. Docusign only uses customer agreement data to improve Iris with explicit customer consent. Companies can also decide which data sets are shared and which are private. ▪ Enterprise-grade and tested : Docusign IAM, powered by Iris, scaled with a customer's organization, supporting AI customization, seamless integrations, and global localization. With a flexible model infrastructure, companies always benefit from the latest LLMs - tailored specifically for agreements.

For example, if a user were to upload a 60-page vendor agreement, a generic AI solution could answer a prompt question when the contract ends. With DocuSign Iris, it can not only tell the user when the contract ends but also flags: the agreement auto-renews for an additional 3 years unless notice is given 90 days before the end date, the payment terms (90 days) are outside the user's company's standard of 30 days, and liability for data breaches is excluded which may require legal review. Iris in action . Iris is actively transforming agreement management for organizations of all sizes. Here are some examples of how Iris enhances a customer's experience from sale to signature:

▪ AI-assisted review : Iris helps streamline contract review and negotiation processes, including reviewing agreements against pre-defined legal standards and suggesting AI-generated markups and clause language. This helps ensure that contracts are thoroughly analyzed for compliance and accuracy with a customer's internal playbooks, reducing the time and manual effort previously required. ▪ Renewal management : Iris simplifies renewal tracking with automated notifications and pre-built reports - delivering actionable insights to ensure timely and efficient contract renewals. This easily prevents unwanted auto-renewals so customers can use the data to identify cost-saving opportunities. - ▪ AI-assisted data extractions : Iris can automatically identify and record critical data buried in agreements. This standardizes unstructured data which makes agreements more discoverable and reportable. Applying AI to agreement management can:

▪ Boost revenue, cut costs with insights. Iris can help sales reps zero in on high-value accounts and start renewal conversations early. ▪ Close agreements in record time. Iris empowers users to self-serve contract-related questions through a generative Q&A experience and uses AI-driven automation to route agreements to the appropriate approvers - helping to prevent bottlenecks and keep workflows moving efficiently. ▪ Minimize legal and financial risk. Iris helps decode legal jargon and complex contract language.

Shortly after Allan Thygesen joined Docusign as CEO in 2022, the company has been investing to support its long-term growth opportunity based on three pillars which we detail below.

Docusign launched the Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform in April 2024 at the company's Momentum customer conference and has been releasing incremental functionality at a rapid pace with no sign of slowing down. A long list of releases over the past year can be found here. We highlight upcoming product releases below:

o January 2026 - AI-Assisted Agreement Type Detection leverages AI to analyze documents in the prepare flow and automatically display the fields that are most relevant to the agreement type, saving time and effort searching through field libraries. o January 2026 - AI-Assisted Field Suggestions auto-places relevant sender, signing, and text fields. o January 2026 - AI-Contract Agent boosts productivity and better manages contract requests with assistants that automate essential tasks like prioritizing contract requests and provide data-backed recommendations. o January 2026 - Data Passthrough to Docusign Navigator unifies data across DocuSign.

o December 2025 - Workspace Templates streamline common processes by creating a templates, allowing users to save time, ensure consistency, and scale processes. ▪ Manage o January 2026 - Natural language search enables customers to ask AI simple questions in everyday language. Developer Ecosystem. Part of Docusign's evolution into a platform company requires supporting a community of developers and partners to create new solutions that extend the capabilities of DOCU's IAM platform. In November 2024, DOCU hosted Docusign Discover, its first-ever developer-focused conference, and launched Docusign for Developers, giving its partners tools to build apps powered by the IAM platform. Partners can share their apps in the Docusign App Center, adding to the over 1,000 active partner integrations with Docusign products.

eSignature and CLM , Docusign's two largest existing products by revenue have seen improved innovation delivery, because of DOCU's investment in the IAM platform, which bring more AI-powered capabilities across the greater Docusign product portfolio. DOCU has also seen that when customers move to IAM, they increase their eSignature usage.

By strengthening its direct sales, partner, and self-service routes to market, DOCU has been aiming to simultaneously accelerate its ability to scale while reducing customer acquisition and management costs. Direct Sales . Docusign has placed a growing emphasis on customer retention and enhancing customer relationships with its direct sales teams. With the launch of IAM, DOCU is focused on delivering greater value to customers through a complete end-to-end agreement management system of record. This requires strengthening its direct sales force's ability to provide greater consultation and solution education to its customers.

- ▪ GTM changes made in Q1 . This year, IAM growth was driven by SMB and midmarket segments due to quicker sales cycles and earlier product launches. As DOCU targets more enterprise clients, it has implemented go-to-market changes, launched an IAM transition SKU for upsells, and shifted many accounts to a self-serve model to allow sales teams to focus on individual clients. Extensive training and upskilling have supported these efforts, and incentive plans now emphasize new growth and IAM sales. In Q2, IAM platform adoption increased its share of direct deals and gross bookings compared to Q1. Third-Party Channel Partners . DOCU is enhancing direct sales and partnerships with leading SIs and technology providers such as Microsoft, SAP, and Salesforce to expand IAM solutions for enterprises. In Q2, its biggest deal was through the Microsoft Azure marketplace.

Digital E-commerce Sales & Self-Service . DOCU is focusing on product-led growth and enhancing selfservice capabilities. In April of this year, the company enabled its larger direct customers to independently increase capacity and renew contracts through a self-serve platform. Digital revenue accounts for approximately 15% of total revenue and grew ~9% in Q3. During Q1, DOCU successfully acquired nearly 1,000 new self-service IAM customers within three weeks, driven entirely by organic adoption before any marketing campaigns were launched.

The third growth pillar is to enhance operational and financial efficiency to scale effectively and sustainably. This includes prioritizing investments in infrastructure and technology that serve DOCU's diverse customer base, including its migration to cloud-based infrastructure (~100bps headwind to FY26 gross margins). Additionally, DOCU continues to evaluate strategic acquisitions and partnerships that align with its growth objectives and expand its product offerings.

DOCU discloses customers (split up by >$300k ACV, enterprise & commercial, and very small businesses), % of revenue from enterprise & commercial vs. very small businesses, and NRR. The dollar-weighted average contract length is 19 months with 63% of contracts less than 12 months in duration. While DOCU will begin disclosing annual ARR and move away from billings, on a TTM basis it has been a great proxy for subscription revenue with implied subscription revenue from billings accounting for >99% of DOCU's reported subscription revenue in FY25 and FY24. Exhibit 5: Subscription Revenue and TTM Subscription Billings Source: BTIG Research, Company Reports DOCU's dollar net retention rate (DNR) compares the ARR for active subscription contracts from Direct customers. DNR of 102% in Q3 improved by 2% points Y/Y, benefiting from steady demand and salesdriven execution. eSignature customers continue to increase overall usage, with utilization rates at multiyear highs, and consistent, positive growth in envelopes sent.

Exhibit 6: DOCU's Net Retention Has Steadily Climbed Since Early 2024 Source: BTIG Research, Company Reports After expanding non-GAAP operating margins from 20.5% in FY23 to 29.8% in FY25, margins are expected to finish flat in FY26 as DOCU made the necessary investments this year to accelerate growth. Exhibit 7: Non-GAAP Operating Expenses Over Time Source: BTIG Research, Company Reports DOCU has implemented three significant rounds of layoffs since September 2022 to reduce costs and improve profitability. ▪ September 2022: Docusign cut about 9% of its workforce. ▪ February 2023: Another round of layoffs approximately 10% of its workforce. ▪ February 2024: A third major round of cuts impacted approximately 6% of the workforce (~400 employees) with the majority in its sales and marketing divisions.

As detailed in the exhibit below, at 4.1x EV/Sales NTM, DOCU shares are currently trading below their 1year median of 4.9x and just above their 3-year median of 4.0x. Exhibit 9: EV/NTM Sales Over the Last 3 Years Source: BTIG Research, FactSet We estimate that DOCU will finish the year operating at the Rule of 39. DOCU's NTM EV/FCF multiple of 13x is below its 1-year median of 16x. Exhibit 10: EV/NTM FCF Over the Last 12 Months Source: BTIG Research, FactSet In Exhibit 11, we list DOCU's peer group, which consists of companies that are, according to consensus estimates, projected to crow CY26E revenue single-digits in CY26. Our $88 PT suggests 17x CY27E EV/FCF, in line with peers.

Docusign, Inc. is a global leader in intelligent agreement management headquartered in San Francisco, California. Originally the company was recognized as the gold standard for digital signature solutions. However, Docusign has expanded its platform over the past decade to deliver end-to-end agreement management for enterprises, government agencies, and SMBs worldwide. Today, Docusign has more than 1.8 million customers and over one billion users in 180+ countries, including more than 95% of the Fortune 500. Docusign helps companies escape what's called the 'agreement trap'-the problem where businesses waste a huge amount of time (about 18% more than necessary) dealing with contracts. Across the world, this adds up to over 55 billion hours lost every year just managing agreements. Docusign's value comes from helping organizations work smarter and faster by centralizing all their agreements in one place, making them easy to find, sign, and manage.

Monetization Model. DOCU utilizes a multi-factor subscription model. Customers can purchase seatbased, envelope-based, or volume contracts, typically for one year or longer. Add-on features, such as advanced AI modules, identity verification, analytics dashboards, and workflow automation, provide incremental revenue levers for Docusign.

Docusign's pricing is based on the number of users, features, and-for eSignature-the number of "Envelopes" used. An Envelope is a digital package used to send documents for signature or approval, echoing the role of a physical envelope in traditional paperwork. To encourage adoption, Docusign also provides limited-feature versions of its eSignature product for free. Recently, it has started offering its IAM platform on a user-based subscription model in select markets, with various pricing options tailored to different use cases and industries. While the company is expanding its intelligent agreement management capabilities, eSignature remains Docusign's primary revenue driver as its newer products are rolled out to more customers and regions. Platform Overview. DOCU's product offerings center around its Intelligent Agreement Management platform. IAM is a highly scalable, AI-driven suite that helps organizations create, commit to, and manage agreements throughout the entire agreement lifecycle. The company's core product lines include:

▪ eSignature. Docusign's flagship solution that allows users to sign and send agreements securely from virtually any device. It has built-in compliance, audit trails, and global trust features. ▪ IAM Platform (IAM). IAM is an AI-native tool that automates document generation, redlining, negotiation, approvals, eSignature, and post-signature management in one integrated package. It connects seamlessly with vital systems (Salesforce, SAP , Workday, Coupa, Microsoft Entra) and supports diverse agreement workflows-sales, procurement, HR, legal, operations. ▪ Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM). Designed for multi-step contract processes. CLM automates and manages everything from clause libraries and change tracking to post-execution obligations and renewals. ▪ Maestro Workflow Templates. Pre-built, no-code templates enable organizations to tailor and automate workflows without IT involvement.

▪ Obligation Management Dashboard. Transforming scattered commitments into intelligence, this feature brings renewal dates, payment terms, and key obligations to the forefront so businesses can maximize contract value and avoid costly oversights . ▪ Agreement Desk and AI-assisted Review. Advanced tools enable customers to bulk process, analyze, and summarize agreements for business-critical terms, compliance risks, or renewal triggers. ▪ Workspaces and Navigator. Centralized, intelligent repositories for agreements that make it easy to search, extract metadata, visualize contractual obligations, and connect dots across departments. ▪ Identity Verification. Integrates with biometric services like CLEAR for ultra-secure, frictionless identity verification for sensitive agreements. ▪ SCIM Identity Management. Enables automated, secure, large-scale user provisioning and governance through integrations with platforms like Okta and Microsoft Entra.

DOCU has historically referenced its eSignature TAM to be $25B and combining the company's broader sign offerings (before IAM and the virality of LLMs) that TAM would increase to $50B which was based on a combination of commissioned third-party research with internal customer count, pricing, and spending data. Below we built out a bottom TAM build for Docusign that is based mostly on US firm-level data segmented by company size. For each firm size cohort, we apply a realistic ARPC assumption, scaled up to reflect average spend by firms in each bracket. Assuming DOCU's international opportunity is 50% of the size of its domestic opportunity implies a $13B global opportunity. This further suggests DOCU is 24% penetrated.
