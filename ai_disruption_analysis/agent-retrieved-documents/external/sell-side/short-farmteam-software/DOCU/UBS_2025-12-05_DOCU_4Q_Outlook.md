While last quarter DocuSign raised its full year billings, revenue and margin outlooks on the back of a strong 2Q/Jul billings performance, this 3Q/Oct quarter lacked some of that upside. Billings growth was again strong on the back of early renewals, but the 4Q/ Jan guide for total revs and billings was reaffirmed and not raised, while margins are expected to decline sequentially. Net, the expected decel to 6.0-6.5% c/c billings and revs growth in 4Q/Jan is likely to weigh on the stock. We remain Neutral-rated.

While DocuSign sounded positive about core e-signature usage trends, several key metrics - 3Q/Oct revs as well as 4Q/Jan revs and billings - fell in-line with our model (not above) and the revs beat was at the lower end of the historical norm. The upside came in 3Q/Oct billings, but DocuSign pinned much of this on renewal timing. Net, there wasn't much upside to our 2H numbers and the c/c exit growth rate of 6-7% dissuades us from raising our FY27 total revs growth estimate of 8.5%. In fact we're trimming it slightly to 7.8%. DocuSign pinned the expected 4Q/Jan decel on tough y/y compares given the timing of renewal activity. While DocuSign isn't a seat-based model, the 4Q/Jan decel at DocuSign, Salesforce and some other SaaS firms is weighing on overall apps sentiment.

We'd flag: 1. We're sympathetic to the decision to move from quarterly billings guide to full year ARR guide. Reported billings has been very lumpy (weak in 1Q/Apr, strong in 2Q/Jul and 3Q/Oct, weaker in 4Q/Jan). Guiding to a level of quarterly renewal activity is evidently tough. 2. DocuSign made a few interesting observations related to AI/OpenAI: a) it is not hearing any 'AI noise' from customers that could be weighing on DocuSign spending intentions, b) customers/users are clearly uploading docs into ChatGPT to search, which in our view skims off use cases for DocuSign's own such features and c) apparently OpenAI has approached DocuSign to partner, perhaps evidence that the model providers are looking to partner with and not displace apps vendors (see our recent report here on how OpenAI is likely to scale into enterprises).

DocuSign's 12x our CY26 FCF estimate strikes us as pretty reasonable for a likely 8% revs growth story with still-rising margins. We're rolling our valuation methodology to CY27E and lowering our price target from $85 to $75, based on 11x CY27E FCF (15x prior on CY26E), which we view as warranted given the single-digit growth profile.

DocuSign offers a range of cloud-based software solutions designed to address the agreement process. DocuSign launched with its eSignature product, seeking to displace outdated, in-person signature requirements for contracts, offer letters, mortgages and other files. DocuSign has since expanded its product offerings to streamline the pre- and postagreement processes. This opportunity, known as contract life cycle management, allows customers to integrate agreements with CRM systems or other workflow tools, and adds features such as identity checks, payment collections, and management controls.

We value DOCU on an EV/FCF multiple. Risks to DocuSign include: 1) Sustainability of the current demand for e-signature, which has benefited from the pandemic's remote work environment, 2) Recently announcement management changes which could lead to sales execution issues, 3) high levels of competition leading to potentially higher levels of discounting.
