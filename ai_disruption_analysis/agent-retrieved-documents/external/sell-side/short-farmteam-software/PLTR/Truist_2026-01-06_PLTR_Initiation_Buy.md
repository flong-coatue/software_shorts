PLTR - Initiating Buy, $223 PT: Leading Software Platform at the Forefront of AI Implementation Initiate with a Buy rating and $223 PT. We acknowledge the significant valuation premium PLTR commands, but continue to view it as a Buy given its significant opportunity to drive GenAI adoption for governments & enterprises. PLTR has seen material improvement in its momentum driven by the release of AIP, with top-line growth accelerating to 63% y/y from 13% y/y as of 2Q23 - with a larger portion of this growth flowing down to op. margins, reaching 50%+ margins. While much of the momentum has come from its US business, we see international as a significant opportunity. We view PLTR as a best-in-class AI asset. See here for our industry overview.

We think Palantir is ideally positioned for increased AI adoption: Palantir holds a unique market position in our view, ideally positioned for increased AI adoption by both government organizations and enterprises. The company has provided a leading software platform that integrates large organizations' proprietary data with their operations and security to improve decision-making, which now positions Palantir to capture GenAI implementation with its AIP as organizations race to generate insights and efficiencies with the technology. Potential for sustainable Rule of 80+ profile: After reaching a Rule of 114 profile last quarter and guiding for Rule of 113 in 4Q25, we see potential for a sustainable Rule of 80+ profile, balanced between 50%+ operating margins and continued strong top-line growth. We compared Palantir against 110 other software companies and found it's expected to generate the highest Rule of 40 over the next 3 years - an unparalleled financial profile, in our view.

Acceleration in US businesses evident, with International AI adoption a potential longterm driver: AI tailwinds have provided meaningful benefits in Palantir's US businesses following the release of AIP in April 2023. Palantir's US Government revenue growth has accelerated to 50%+ y/y the last two quarters from 10% y/y in 2Q23, while its Commercial revenue growth accelerated to 73% y/y last quarter from 10% y/y in 2Q23 (with US Commercial growth accelerating to 121% y/y). Strong cash flow generation could drive increased capital returns over time: Now operating at a 40%+ FCF margin profile, we see potential for Palantir to significantly increase capital returns over the long term. While high levels of stock-based compensation had been an investor concern for some time, Palantir has shown it can operate profitably by generating positive GAAP EPS for the past 12 quarters and on track for a 13th straight quarter.

Premium valuation warranted based on one-of-one financial profile: While Palantir continues to trade at >70x NTM EV/S, we believe a premium is warranted based on the company's one-of-one financial profile - consensus expectations for the highest margins and top-3 growth out of 111 software companies for each of the next 3 consecutive years. Initiating Buy, $223 PT based on 65x 2027E EV/Sales. Risks include: premium valuation, customer concentration, governance, reputational, technology & cybersecurity, and macro risks.

Palantir builds enterprise software platforms that enable large organizations to integrate, manage, and analyze massive, complex datasets for decision-making . Palantir's platforms enable some of the world's largest organizations to turn disparate, siloed data into actionable insights to address some of the world's most difficult problems today. Palantir operates on a subscription-based model typically with large, long-term contracts, primarily targeting government agencies and enterprises . The company's software platforms also incorporate embedded teams forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) - who help to integrate and tailor its software within clients' workflows - further embedding its platforms into customer operations. Its latest platform, AIP, embeds LLMs and AI models securely into customers' Gotham/Foundry workflows to enable real-time, explainable decision-making on sensitive data.

· Ideally positioned for increased AI adoption: Palantir holds a unique market position in our view, ideally positioned for increased AI adoption by both governments & enterprises. The company has domain expertise in data integration & security software and is now enabling organizations to deploy GenAI on their data as they race to generate insights and efficiencies. · Sustainable Rule of 80 profile: After reaching a Rule of 114 (63% y/y revenue growth + 51% operating margin) last quarter, we expect Palantir to maintain a strong margin profile while continuing to benefit from AI tailwinds on its top line. · Acceleration in US evident, with International a potential long-term driver: AI tailwinds have shown tangible benefits in its US business, accelerating to 77% y/y growth in 3Q25, but we see potential for tailwinds to extend to International as well over time.

· Cash flow generation could drive increased capital returns: Now operating at a 40%+ FCF margin profile, we see potential for Palantir to significantly increase capital returns over the long term, likely through share repurchases, which could offset SBC dilution. · Premium valuation warranted based on one-of-one profile: While Palantir continues to trade >70x NTM EV/S, we believe a premium is warranted based on the company's one-of-one financial profile -consensus expectations for the highest margins and top-3 growth out of 111 software companies for the next 3 consecutive years.

We believe Palantir's TAM has grown significantly since its 2020 Direct Listing, with AI accelerating growth. Sources: Company Reports, Gartner, GAO, IMF Government based on: 1) Increased government discretionary contract spend (e.g., $755B in US vs. $665B in 2020), 2) higher % of contract spend for software & consulting, and 3) increased use cases for PLTR such as TITAN/hardware. Commercial based on: 1) 10.5K+ $500M+ revenue companies (up from 6K in 2020), 2) increased overall IT spend by enterprises, and 3) increased software & IT services spend as % of IT spend.

Palantir turns complex data into mission-critical decisions, while rivals excel at analytics and visualization. While Palantir has been a leading software provider to the US Government, the US Army also selected Palantir for its TITAN contract ($178.4M) - the first time a software company has served as prime on a significant hardware program. This could position Palantir to compete for a larger portion of the US Government's IT contracts . Palantir positions itself as a secure, end-to-end operating system (Foundry, AIP, Apollo), while leading cloud, data, and analytics platforms dominate data storage, processing, and analytics with modular, cloud-native services. Competing cloud platforms often focus on modular infrastructure and analytics, and business intelligence tools focused on visualization and reporting. Palantir's platform goes beyond insights to provide actionable workflows and is made for high-sensitivity environments , with security and compliance built into the platform.

· AI strategy: Palantir's history of generating insights for its customers by consolidating and integrating their data and providing security infrastructure for their data has uniquely positioned the company for today's AI moment. Palantir has integrated AI capabilities into its Gotham (Government) and Foundry (Commercial) platforms and released its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in April 2023. AIP effectively utilizes Palantir's data integration and security capabilities and enables its government and commercial customers to leverage LLMs on top of their proprietary data within Palantir's secure environment - providing Palantir with ideal positioning as organizations ramp up AI adoption.

· Palantir's AI architecture: Palantir's AI architecture consists of layers in which its Gotham/Foundry platforms provide the data foundation layer (data integration and ontology), AIP provides the reasoning and operational layer (leveraging LLMs on top of their data, building AI agents/copilots), and Apollo provides secure, continuous delivery of GenAI models and software across various environments (cloud-agnostic). AIP supports a wide range of LLMs across the leading providers, including OpenAI (private), Anthropic (private), Google (GOOGL, Buy, Squali), Meta (META, Buy, Squali), Mistral (private), and xAI (private).

· Enabling its customers to utilize AI on their proprietary data: Palantir has already established its domain expertise in data integration and security for government agencies and enterprises throughout its operating history. Now, it holds an ideal competitive position in our view as the company is enabling organizations to leverage GenAI/LLM capabilities on their own proprietary data, which Palantir has demonstrated it can integrate and secure. We believe this could contribute to existing customers expanding their contracts and draw in new customers eager to adopt AI capabilities and leverage their proprietary data in a secure environment.

· Revenue growth across Government and Commercial have reaccelerated: The release of AIP in April 2023 has likely driven a meaningful reacceleration in revenue in our view. Government revenue has accelerated to 55% y/y in 3Q25 from 15% y/y as of 2Q23, while Commercial revenue accelerated to 73% y/y last quarter from 10% as of 2Q23. Palantir should continue to benefit as organizations race to adopt AI capabilities - leading to expansion with existing customers and new customers onboarding. · Continued investment in AIP: Palantir noted during 3Q25 that it is continuing to invest aggressively in AIP and the US while driving operating leverage at scale. We believe that while OpEx dollars will grow, the growth rate will continue to trail revenue growth, leading to continued margin expansion.

Sources: Truist Securities, Company Reports While Palantir's revenue has scaled significantly since 2019, expected to >5x from $743M to a guided $4.4B this year, Non-GAAP operating margins have also expanded significantly during that timespan, from -45% in 2019 to an expected 49% this year (expected 94pt expansion). This would imply 103% on a Rule of 40 for 2025E.

· Palantir deploys FDEs into customer environments to configure Foundry/Gotham for mission-specific workflows. · This creates deep integration and high switching costs but can also lead to longer sales cycles and higher upfront investment.

· Pre-built modules for healthcare operations, supply chains, defense logistics, and manufacturing help accelerate time-to-value. · These templates scale beyond bespoke deployments, but Palantir still leans heavily on customization.

· Focus on large, strategic accounts (Fortune 500 companies, defense agencies, healthcare systems, etc.). · Minimal channel reliance relative to cloud vendors as Palantir prefers more control over deployments.

· Palantir sells software plus embedded expertise - O&M services provide critical updates and support necessary to operate. · Contrasts with competitors that rely on partners for integration. We believe Palantir's GTM strategy outperforms its competition in complex, mission-critical environments (defense, healthcare, manufacturing) - where security, governance, and operationalization matter by providing a full stack with security incorporated . Once deployed, we also think its platform can deliver cross-functional workflows faster than combining multiple tools due to its end-to-end nature. We view AIP as a differentiated layer with guardrails built in for sensitive contacts - with few others providing this at scale. However, Palantir's high-touch model doesn't scale as easily as SaaS and therefore isn't as feasible for SMBs or the mid-market. The upfront investment and embedded teams can also be perceived as more costly than modular cloud stacks. Sources: Truist Securities, Company Reports

Palantir serves global government agencies and commercial enterprises, with governments comprising ~55% of revenue. Within its Government segment, the US Government has historically comprised 75%+ of the segment's revenue and has risen to ~77% YTD. US enterprises comprised 40% of Commercial revenue in 2022, but steadily rose to 54% in 2024, and have made up ~69% of the segment's revenue YTD in 2025.

Palantir has been a clear beneficiary of AI tailwinds in our view. Government revenue growth has accelerated to 55% y/y (to a ~$2.5B annual run rate) from 15% y/y in 2Q23 while Commercial revenue growth has accelerated to 73% y/y (to a ~$2.2B annual run rate) from 10% y/y as of 2Q23. We believe PLTR was uniquely positioned for the moment with its deep expertise in consolidating government and enterprise organizations' data and enabling them to generate insights from the data.

PLTR released its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in April 2023 and has incorporated AI capabilities into its Gotham and Foundry platforms. We think AIP has helped revolutionize its growth trajectory as government agencies and enterprises work to leverage GenAI/LLMs into their processes. We think PLTR's domain expertise in data analytics (and data security) provided it with an advantaged position to capture this business, with significant runway remaining as AI adoption proliferates.

Over the last 3 years, saw a $60M improvement in profit and expect an additional $100M next 3 years . Expect end-to-end adoption of tech advancements leveraging Palantir will double their 5-year CAGR . Underwriters now able to access necessary data within 23 hours through Palantir, rather than 2-4 weeks before .

Palantir's business with NHS England exemplifies how Palantir wins business with its go-to-market and land-and-expand strategies. We believe Palantir's end-to-end platform provided a key advantage here as it provides the full stack, including advanced security on top of data integration and analytics, as NHS highlighted patient privacy as a top priority. Other options may have required NHS to combine tools, creating complexity. In May 2024, NHS estimated that the FDP built by Palantir will realize benefits of £780 million over 7 years , for a benefit-cost ratio of 4.92 .

Palantir's material margin expansion over the past 6 years has largely been driven by operating leverage - while OpEx has grown, it has grown at a meaningfully lower rate than revenue. This dynamic is highlighted by OpEx expected to comprise just 38% of revenue in 2025E from 116% in 2019 . COGS as a % of revenue declined to 19% in 2020 (from 29% in 2019) and is expected to remain 17% this year, as it includes O&M, professional service, and 3P cloud hosting expenses.

As revenue has scaled, more of it has flowed through to operating profits - with meaningfully higher growth rates in operating profit vs. OpEx line items as evidence.

PLTR's share price of $174.04 implies EV/S and EV/FCF multiples of 52x and 103x on our 2027 estimates, respectively. Given our view that Palantir is ideally positioned to enable GenAI implementation for enterprises and governments, we see potential to grow into the valuation and believe PLTR warrants the premium valuation. We initiate PLTR with a Buy rating and price target of $223 based on 65x 2027E EV/Sales.

While this is a significant premium valuation, we view PLTR as a one-of-one asset and a significant outlier in terms of financial performance and continue to see room for upside on consensus estimates. We compared Palantir across 110 other software companies and found it is only not expected to generate the highest Rule of 40 (revenue growth + adj. operating margins) this year, but also in 2026E and in 2027E - we believe 3 consecutive years of the highest Rule of 40 Score is unparalleled in the software space. Our valuation multiple represents a 119% premium to PLTR's historical average given the significant demand tailwinds the company is seeing relative to prior years and is 16% lower than its current forward multiple.

Palantir has traded at a historical average of 28x EV/NTM Sales and continues to trade well above that level despite trading off its highs of ~98x. While we acknowledge the valuation premium, we believe the company is positioned for significant growth and margin expansion, driving a unique, balanced Rule of 100+ profile. We see further room for upside to consensus estimates, especially on margins.

Palantir also trades above its historical average of 119x NTM FCF, but off its highs. We believe the valuation implies significant execution by the company, but we believe the company earns a premium with its unique financial profile, expected to have top-3 growth and the widest operating margins out of 111 software companies over the next 3 years (consensus).

We compared PLTR against 110 other software companies and while we did find a significant valuation premium, we also found significant outperformance on financial metrics expected highest margins & 3 rd- fastest growth this year (consensus estimates). Sources: Truist Securities, FactSet

For 2026E, Palantir is expected to be the fastest-growing software company as well as the most profitable on an adjusted operating basis (consensus). The expected Rule of 92 is based on 42% y/y growth and 50% operating margin . Sources: Truist Securities, FactSet

Palantir is also expected to generate Rule of 90 in 2027E (consensus), which would rank 1/111 for the 3 rd consecutive year . We believe a significant premium valuation is warranted given its unparalleled combination of growth and profitability . Sources: Truist Securities, FactSet

During the transition to streaming, Netflix traded at high multiples (>400x P/E in 2015, >100x for years ), but has largely grown into its valuation since, now trading at ~31x NTM P/E . NFLX shares have increased >600% since this peak P/E valuation level .

TSLA's valuation has been controversial relative to the rest of the auto industry and given questions around profitability and the sustainability of its growth. However, shares are up >2,770% since reaching >200x NTM P/E in August 2019 (& >100x for years) . Sources: Truist Securities, FactSet

· Valuation risk: Palantir has traded at premium valuation levels, reaching >90x EV/NTM Revenue in October 2025. The company's stock has been polarizing and has received significant attention due to the company's involvement in AI/data and government affairs, including US military contracts, providing software to Ukraine, and a strategic partnership with the Israeli Defense Ministry. The company has received significant retail interest, and any impacts to its business could lead to a shift in sentiment and impacts to its premium valuation and stock price. · Customer concentration risk: As the company largely serves government agencies and enterprises, it faces customer concentration risk - its 20 largest customers comprised 45% of revenue in 2024, with its three largest comprising 17%. Impacts to its largest customers could have significant ramifications for its own results. · Governance risk: The multiple class structure of Palantir's common stock effectively concentrates voting power, providing its founders with at least 49.999999% of voting power and control over the company.

· Reputational risk: Palantir could face reputational risk due to the use of its software tools by government agencies and enterprises that could generate negative headlines or lead to backlash from some in the public. · Technology and cybersecurity risks: Palantir could face competitive risks if it is unable to adapt to or adopt new/impactful technologies, operate third-party integrations, or if its platform is impacted by cybersecurity threats. · Macroeconomic risks : Palantir is subject to macroeconomic risks as they relate to the potential impacts on government agencies and enterprises and any impacts to their IT, software, and services budgets.

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) provides the leading software platform at the forefront of AI implementation for government organizations and enterprises. The company was founded in Palo Alto, CA, in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and Nathan Gettings, and named after the "seeing stones" in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The founders believed they could apply software similar to PayPal's fraud recognition systems to "reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties." The CIA was an early customer and its In-Q-Tel venture capital arm was an early investor in Palantir as the company largely served defense and intelligence agencies early on, before extending its software to enterprises. In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army to enforce Section 2377 (which requires the US federal government to use commercial options to "the maximum extent practicable" rather than building them in-house) and won in 2018, leading to significant implications for its business with the US Army, and eventually, the entire US Government. Today, Palantir's business lines are broken down

between Government and Commercial, with Government comprising ~55% of total revenue. Palantir is headquartered in Denver, CO.

We rate Palantir Buy as we view the company's software platforms as ideally positioned for current AI-driven demand tailwinds. The company has developed expertise in providing software that enables large organizations to integrate, manage, and analyze massive and complex datasets securely to better inform decision-making - we believe that expertise is now a key competitive differentiator as enterprises look to implement GenAI within their workflows in a secure, auditable manner due to regulatory requirements. Palantir's release of AIP has helped meaningfully accelerate top-line growth as enterprises have grown to trust the company's platform in implementing GenAI and LLMs atop their proprietary data, and we believe significant opportunity remains, with further International AI adoption as a longer-term opportunity. Meanwhile, the company is also driving significant operating leverage with its incremental revenue growth, and we see potential room for upside to consensus estimates. We believe the company's balance of growth and profitability (expected Rule of 90+ the next three years) is truly unique and warrants a significant premium valuation.

Our $223 price target is based on 65x our 2027E EV/Sales. We view PLTR as a one-of-one asset and a significant outlier in terms of financial performance and see room for upside on consensus estimates. Our valuation multiple represents a 119% premium to PLTR's historical average given the significant demand tailwinds the company is seeing relative to prior years and is 16% lower than its current forward multiple. Given our growth outlook for the company, we believe a premium multiple assumption is justified. Risks include: premium valuation, customer concentration, governance, reputational, technology & cybersecurity, and macroeconomic risks.
