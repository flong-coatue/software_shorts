✓ Earnings Recap

PLTR - Delivers as a Conclusive AI Pure-Play Victor PLTR reported its strongest quarter to date as a public company with revenue growth accelerating for the 10th straight quarter to 70% y/y at a $4B+ annual revenue scale. We view this momentum as further evidence PLTR is enabling AI adoption at scale for its customers, leading to discernible results. We materially raise both our 2026E revenue and FCF estimates by >$1B, both above the guidance ranges. We continue to see runway for this momentum with RPO +188% y/y, US Commercial Remaining Deal Value +145% y/y, and believe management commentary indicates demand in the US continues to outstrip supply. We view PLTR as the top AI pure-play in software today.

PT and Valuation: We reiterate our Buy rating and $223 PT. The strong execution in 4Q25 and continued >2x growth in backlog metrics provide us with greater conviction in PLTR's long runway to enable AI adoption for both enterprises and government agencies. Our PT is based on 51.5x 2027E EV/S (lowered from 65x on materially higher estimates).

Estimate Changes: We materially raise our 2026E revenue estimate by >$1B to $7.39B (65% y/y) from $6.29B (43% y/y); our Commercial revenue estimate increases to $3.90B (88% y/y) from $3.15B (55% y/y) as we contemplate Palantir's balance of new customer additions vs. expanded revenue per customer. Our adjusted FCF estimate also increases meaningfully by $1.3B to $4.22B (57% FCF margin) from $2.92B (46% FCF margin). Our estimates are above the high ends of the guides as we see upside driven by the company's ARPU expansion with US customers.

4Q25 Results: Palantir reported $1.407B revenue (70% y/y growth), 5% above consensus of $1.341B (62% y/y). Non-GAAP operating income of $798M (57% operating margin) was 14% above the Street's $701M (52% margin), and marked 6pts of sequential margin expansion. This equates to a Rule of 127 for the quarter. GAAP EPS of $0.24 was positive for the 14th consecutive quarter and above the Street's $0.18. Additionally, PLTR reported $791M of adjusted FCF (56% FCF margin), well above consensus of $594M (44% FCF margin). 1Q26 Guidance: PLTR guided Q1 revenue to $1.532B - $1.536B, (73.5% y/y at midpoint), ~16% above the Street's $1.326B (50% y/y). Q1 operating income was guided to $870M $874M (57% operating margin), 36% above consensus of $640M (48% op. margin).

FY26 Guidance: For FY26, PLTR guided revenue to $7.182B - $7.198B (60.7% y/y growth at midpoint), 14% above consensus of $6.295B (43.4% y/y). FY25 non-GAAP operating income was guided to $4.126B - $4.142B, with a midpoint of $4.134B (57.5% op. margin), 32% above consensus of $3.140B (49.9% op. margin). This implies 118% on a Rule of 40 for 2026. Management also guided FCF to $3.925B - $4.125B, with the midpoint of $4.025B (56.0% FCF margin) 45% above consensus of $2.784B (44.2% margin).

Other Key Metrics: PLTR's backlog metrics indicate to us the company has significant runway remaining with its top-line trends: Total RPO grew +143% y/y to $4.21B (excludes government contracts and those <12 mos), TCV grew +137% y/y to $4.26B, and US Commercial Remaining Deal Value grew +145% y/y to $4.38B. NDRR expanded 5pts q/q to 139%, and doesn't account for revenue from new customers added in the past 12 months.

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) provides the leading software platform at the forefront of AI implementation for government organizations and enterprises. The company was founded in Palo Alto, CA, in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and Nathan Gettings, and named after the "seeing stones" in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The founders believed they could apply software similar to PayPal's fraud recognition systems to "reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties." The CIA was an early customer and its In-Q-Tel venture capital arm was an early investor in Palantir as the company largely served defense and intelligence agencies early on, before extending its software to enterprises. In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army to enforce Section 2377 (which requires the US federal government to use commercial options to "the maximum extent practicable" rather than building them in-house) and won in 2018, leading to significant implications for its business with the US Army, and eventually, the entire US Government. Today, Palantir's business lines are broken down

between Government and Commercial, with Government comprising ~55% of total revenue. Palantir is headquartered in Denver, CO.

We rate Palantir Buy as we view the company's software platforms as ideally positioned for current AI-driven demand tailwinds. The company has developed expertise in providing software that enables large organizations to integrate, manage, and analyze massive and complex datasets securely to better inform decision-making - we believe that expertise is now a key competitive differentiator as enterprises look to implement GenAI within their workflows in a secure, auditable manner due to regulatory requirements. Palantir's release of AIP has helped meaningfully accelerate top-line growth as enterprises have grown to trust the company's platform in implementing GenAI and LLMs atop their proprietary data, and we believe significant opportunity remains, with further International AI adoption as a longer-term opportunity. Meanwhile, the company is also driving significant operating leverage with its incremental revenue growth, and we see potential room for upside to consensus estimates. We believe the company's balance of growth and profitability (expected Rule of 90+ the next three years) is truly unique and warrants a significant premium valuation.

Our $223 price target is based on 51.5x our 2027E EV/Sales. We view PLTR as a one-of-one asset and a significant outlier in terms of financial performance and see room for upside on consensus estimates. Our valuation multiple represents a 78% premium to PLTR's historical average given the significant demand tailwinds the company is seeing relative to prior years and is 21% higher than its current 2-year forward multiple. Given our growth outlook for the company, we believe a premium multiple assumption is justified. Risks include: premium valuation, customer concentration, governance, reputational, technology & cybersecurity, and macroeconomic risks.
