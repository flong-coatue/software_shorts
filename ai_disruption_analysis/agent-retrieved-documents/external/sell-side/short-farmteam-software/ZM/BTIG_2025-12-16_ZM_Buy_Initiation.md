Small Deals, Big Impact; Assuming Coverage at Buy, $105 PT

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: ZM is in a rare category of software companies in the green this year with shares up 10% YTD on the back of a strong Q3 print that sent shares up 10% T+1. Simply put, things are good . We believe ZM could accelerate revenue growth to 5%+ next quarter to ~$5B in annualized revenue driven by Enterprise revenue growth reaching 7%+, while the Online business has all-time low average monthly churn of 2.7% and is likely to benefit next year from a potential price increase to annually paying customers and cross-selling Bonsai . From a product perspective, we are particularly excited about the CX business, which is growing high-doubledigits , while Zoom Phone ARR is still growing mid-teens and Workvivo is seeing momentum even after lapping the Meta (META, Not Rated) partnership. We also note that Enterprise dollar churn has gone down for the last five quarters, and ZM continues to move upmarket as seen with Q3 acceleration of growth in the number of

customers spending >$100k on a TTM basis . After years of media commentary around large-scale M&A, while not technically off the table, we believe ZM may be more acquisitive but continue to focus on tuck-in deals like Workvivo at the high end. Meanwhile, ZM has been on a steady pace of repurchasing >5 million shares (1.7%+ of DSOs) each of the last few quarters . In addition, SBC is coming down fast with the expiration of top-up grants giving us line of sight to ~30% GAAP operating margins in the next few years . AI risks are relatively low here, while ZM is monetizing a number of solutions including Contact Center Elite and now Custom AI Companion among others. We are assuming coverage with a Buy rating and a $105 price target.

■ Enterprise Growth Drivers . In a bull case scenario, we believe Enterprise revenue growth can modestly accelerate to 6.7%. Zoom Phone ARR is growing mid-teens (we estimate FY26 revenue of $749M), CX is taking market share with ARR in the triple-digit millions and growing high-double-digits (we estimate FY26 revenue of $115M growing 90%+), and Workvivo continues to see momentum even as it laps the Meta partnership (we estimate approaching $70M in ARR growing ~50% y/ y). The latest tuck-in acquisition of BrightHire should also drive more strength in Enterprise next year.

■ AI Monetization . Besides indirectly monetizing AI through AI Companion 3.0 (free for paid accounts) boosting retention, many of ZM's directly monetized AI capabilities are expected to drive even more growth next year. Two quarters in, Custom AI Companion is scaling with several Fortune 200 accounts, so they can tailor AI to their organization's unique workflows. Nine of last quarter's top ten CX deals involved paid AI, such as Zoom Virtual Agent or AI Expert Assist.

■ Capital Allocation . For more than four years, ZM has had $4B+ in cash, and it has had over $7B+ in cash for roughly the last two years. With a focus on tuck-in M&A over the past few years, we do not believe ZM will change course and do large-scale M&A next year. Over the TTM, ZM has spent 82% of its FCF repurchasing stock, or ~$400M per quarter. With SBC as a % of revenue set to decline from 16% to <12% beyond FY28 as top-up grants expire, we see a clear path for ZM to reach 30% GAAP operating margins. ■ Valuation: Our $105 PT is based on 13x CY27E EV/FCF, which is in line with its singledigit CY26E revenue growth peer group.

Zoom Video Communications (ZM) is one of the few software companies posting positive YTD performance, with shares up 10% after a strong Q3 print, driven by Q4 guidance suggesting a path to enterprise revenue growth acceleration while delivering recordlow monthly churn in its Online business. We expect revenue growth to accelerate to 5%+ next quarter, supported by high doubledigit CX growth, mid-teens Zoom Phone ARR, and momentum in Workvivo. Recent tuck-in acquisitions (Bonsai, BrightHire) further solidify growth durability, while directly monetized AI solutions are scaling with major clients. ZM's healthy capital allocation with ~$8B in cash, steady buybacks (~1.7% DSOs quarterly), and declining SBC sets the stage for ~30% GAAP operating margins in the next few years.

■ Q4 earnings ■ Potential acceleration in Enterprise revenue growth ■ Potential price increase for annually paying Online customers ■ Monetization of new AI SKUs like Custom AI Companion and existing like ZCC Elite

■ Total revenue grows 3% and 3% in CY26 and CY27, respectively ■ 39% FCF margins in CY27 ■ 13x CY27e EV/FCF which implies 5.0x CY27e EV/Sales Implied Fair Value = $105/share

■ Total revenue grows 5% and 4% in CY26 and CY27, respectively ■ 40% FCF margins in CY27 ■ 14x CY27e EV/FCF which implies 5.8x CY27e EV/Sales Implied Fair Value = $120/share

■ Total revenue grows 3% and 1% in CY26 and CY27, respectively ■ 37% FCF margins in CY27 ■ 8x CY27e EV/FCF which implies 2.9x CY27e EV/Sales Implied Fair Value = $70/share

Q4 Guidance Suggests Acceleration . ZM delivered strong Q3 results and an even better Q4 guide that with prior beat cadences suggests enterprise revenue growth could accelerate from 6% in Q3. ZM has beaten the midpoint of its quarterly revenue guidance by $15M-$20M in each of the past 9 quarters except for F4Q25. Assuming ZM beats Q4 revenue guidance by $15M and Online revenue is flat sequentially (compared to being down $1M and up $3M sequentially in prior Q4 periods), this implies Q4 Enterprise Revenue of $759M (consensus projecting $747M), representing 7.4% growth, up from 6.1% in Q3 .

Yet, Y/Y growth in forward-looking enterprise revenue proxies decelerated - current deferred revenue grew 5.0% compared to 5.3% in Q2, enterprise billings grew 5.5% compared to 6.5% in Q2, and cRPO grew 5.6% compared to 5.9% in Q2. Management called out there is noise in these proxies particularly due to ZM coming off its low point in F2Q25 where revenue growth bottomed out at 2.1%. ZM's revenue growth stabilizing in F2Q25 was a culmination of getting through the company's most significant renewals in which many customers were rightsizing their needed Zoom licenses along with continued growth in Contact Center and Zoom Phone while AI helped boost gross retention. One metric that did accelerate in Q3 was the number of customers spending over $100K in TTM revenue, which finished Q3 at 4,363, up 9.2% compared to growing 8.7% in Q2 . From a product perspective, we highlight which of the company's products are driving growth below.

Zoom Phone. On October 9, 2025, Zoom Phone hit 10 million seats, a very impressive feat considering Zoom Phone was just at 1 million Phone seats in December 2020. In F2Q24, ZM shared that Zoom Phone revenue reached nearly $0.5B in an annualized run rate. Therefore, assuming F2Q24 Zoom Phone revenue of $124M and 6.5 million paid seats, this suggests over $6 per month per paid seat which we use with Zoom seat disclosures provided by the company for estimating Zoom Phone revenue over time. Zoom Phone ARR grew mid-teens in Q3 and H1 FY26. We estimate that ZM can finish FY26 with Zoom Phone revenue of $749M (+15% Y/Y) . While we do not know Zoom's enterprise gross revenue retention rate, assuming it has been ~95%, we estimate that Zoom Phone drove 33% / 50% / 58% of the new Enterprise revenue added in FY26 / FY25 / FY24.

Customer Experience (CX) . This is a suite of tools designed to help businesses manage and improve customer interactions. Key components include Zoom Contact Center for omnichannel support across voice, video, and chat, and Zoom Virtual Agent, an AI-powered chatbot for automated customer service . The product suite also features tools like Zoom AI Expert Assist for real-time agent support and Workforce Engagement Management to optimize agent scheduling . In Q3, nine of top ten CX deals involved paid AI, such as Zoom Virtual Agent or AI Expert Assist , as enterprises use Zoom to deliver faster, more personalized service. CX is one of ZM's fastest-growing businesses and Q3 ARR grew in the high double-digits. In just three years after launching Zoom Contact Center, it was included in the 2025 Gartner (IT, Not Rated) Magic Quadrant for Contact Center as a Service. In Q2, ZM shared that its top ten Contact Center deals were all displacements of leading competitors (all but one were cloud displacements)

and that the number of Zoom Contact Center Customers with >$100k ARR grew 94% Y/Y to 229. For sizing CX, at this year's Zoomtopia, the company shared that CX has triple-digit MM ARR and is growing high double digits. If we assume CX finishes the year at $115M in revenue growing 94%, CX will represent 18% of new Enterprise revenue added in FY26 . We believe this could increase to 22% in FY27 and 25% in FY28 based on our forecast for CX revenue reaching $181M (+57% Y/Y) / $258M (+43% Y/Y) in FY27E / FY28E . Gartner estimated that combined end-user spending on contact center and GenAI customer support is expected to achieve a CAGR of 20% from 2023 ($18.5B) to 2028 ($47.1B) . An overview of the forecast assumptions is as follows:

▪ The growth of online purchasing and digital engagement is projected to drive a 16% increase in customer service interaction volume from 2024 to 2028 , leading to the evolution of overall customer service programs. ▪ Changing customer preferences that would have previously required live agents will result in a shift of an additional 10% of interactions toward self-service options by 2027 . ▪ The emergence of GenAI capabilities that assist customer service representatives will contribute to productivity improvements and a decrease in agent demand by approximately 2% annually from 2024 through 2026. ▪ GenAI capabilities that replace customer service representatives will result in agent reductions of 3% to 4% or more annually, starting in 2027 . ▪ CCaaS agent prices will increase from $145 to $175 per user per month from 2023 through 2028 as customer support capabilities become infused with more sophisticated AI and the attach rate of special-purpose software increases.

Workvivo . On April 21, 2023, ZM acquired Workvivo, a provider of an employee experience platform, for $216M. During the earnings call following the acquisition, management noted that it had a minimal impact on both the top line and bottom line - we estimate $15M-$20M in annual revenue at the time of the deal closing.

In May 2024, Workvivo was named Meta's (META, Not Rated) preferred migration partner as Meta was shutting down Workplace from Meta. This drove a lot of momentum for Workvivo, and in Q3 ZM demonstrated that Workvivo continues to see strength even as it laps the Meta partnership - Workvivo logos grew nearly 70% y/y to 1,225, with customers spanning mid-market up to the Fortune 10. In Q2, Workvivo reached 168 customers with over $100K ARR, up 143% y/y. Considering that Workvivo was listed below CX in the 'rapid growth' bucket and no comment was made about its ARR, we think it is reasonable to believe that Workvivo hasn't crossed $100M ARR and is growing slower than CX. Therefore, we estimate that Workvivo is approaching ~$70M in ARR growing ~50% Y/Y . AI Monetization. Zoom's AI monetization strategy can be broken into direct and indirect monetization:

▪ Indirect Monetization: AI Companion 3.0, which brings agentic capabilities like actively making suggestions or generating agendas and actionable items, is included for free for paid accounts. The reason this is monetized indirectly is because once customers are using AI Companion, they are less likely to churn and more likely to expand with Zoom over time. ▪ Direct Monetization: Zoom has horizontal solutions like Custom AI Companion, which is offered for $12 per user per month , allowing companies to tailor AI to their organization's unique workflows by creating custom agents. These agents let customers automate routine tasks, surface the right information, and interact with a team's tools and knowledge bases. Zoom's CX Elite plan costs $149/user/month , compared to Premium for $99 and Essentials for $69, and

includes AI Expert Assist (provides agents with AI-powered tools to efficiently resolve customer issues), Advanced Quality Management (uses AI to analyze customer and agent interactions to improve operational efficiency, agent performance, and customer satisfaction), and Workforce Management (AI tool that helps contact centers forecast demand and create optimized schedules). Zoom Revenue Accelerator (separate add-on) provides sales teams with AI tools that can automate prospecting, cut repetitive tasks, and surface insights so reps can focus on relationships and closing deals. Coming in January 2026, ZRA's new agentic prospecting skill is an always-on pipeline builder that can research leads from events and other sources, uses agentic reasoning to surface top prospects, and initiates outreach. Zoom also has industry solutions like Custom AI Companion for healthcare and education. Exhibit 3: ZM's AI Monetization Strategy Source: Zoomtopia 2025 Investor Presentation

Management's M&A Thoughts . During this year's Zoomtopia, management highlighted how it has a 'healthy balance sheet, and that it's a good time to buy a company and stay tuned.' The company's messaging around M&A was reiterated on the recent Q3 earnings call and is as follows: 1) be very thoughtful and disciplined in both acquisitions and integrations, 2) be strategically aligned with synergies, and 3) come with sound financials, which typically means small-to-medium-sized investments. Sitting on a lot of cash . For more than four years, ZM has had $4B+ in cash; and it has had over $7B+ in cash for roughly the last two years. While ZM has focused on tuck-in acquisitions, it has also not ruled out transformational M&A which is technically still on the table. Yet, we do not believe ZM will do large-scale M&A next year . Recent M&A includes:

- ▪ Bright Hire (11/2025) - BrightHire was built on top of Zoom and is an AI-powered platform that automates and streamlines the hiring process by providing tools for interview planning, notetaking, and interviewer coaching. It helps companies create job descriptions and interview plans, records and transcribes interviews, generates automated notes and highlights, and offers AIpowered coaching to improve interviewer skills and reduce bias. A key feature is BrightHire Screen, an AI interviewer that conducts initial candidate screenings asynchronously. The company has hundreds of customers including Canva (Private), Ramp (Private), Zapier (Private), etc. The company has 50+ employees according to LinkedIn (MSFT, Not Rated) and raised $20.5M through a Series B in 2021.

▪ Bonsai (11/2025) - Bonsai is an all-in-one client engagement platform that helps freelancers and small businesses seamlessly manage clients, projects, invoicing and payments. Put simply, Bonsai brings a set of tools to Zoom that address the specific needs of small businesses looking to scale. The company was founded in 2015 and has 60+ employees according to LinkedIn. ▪ Workvivo (4/2023) - Workvivo, as noted above, is a provider of an employee experience platform. Zoom acquired Workvivo for $216M . ▪ Solvvy (5/2022) - A few months after ZM launched Zoom Contact Center, the company acquired Solvvy, a leading conversational AI and automation platform for customer support. This acquisition helped accelerate the development of Zoom Virtual Agent. Zoom paid $121M in an all-cash deal to acquire Solvvy .

Room for bigger buybacks . Another part of the company's capital allocation strategy is leveraging buybacks. Over the TTM, ZM has spent 82% of its Free Cash Flow repurchasing stock, and since 2024 ZM has repurchased 32.5M shares at an average share price of $73.50. In Q3, ZM repurchased 5.1M shares (6.0M in Q2) at an average price of $81 per share (compared to $78 per share in Q2), totaling $414M spent ($463M in Q2) which represented 67% of ZM's FCF (91% in Q2). In November 2025, ZM's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.0B of its outstanding Class A common stock. This leaves ZM with $1.3B of the repurchase authorization remaining. At ZM's current pace, the company would get through most of the $1.3B by the end of F2Q27.

SBC is falling fast . From August 2021, ZM's share price declined by more than 80% over a span of two years. To better retain its employees, ZM put a program in place to do top up grants so if employees were under value on their first-year anniversary, ZM topped up their grants to get them back to their starting level. The way this gets amortized is that the top up grant continues to vest over the remaining period of their four-year grant. This caused SBC to be elevated until the expiration of these top-up grants through FY27 as ZM ended the program on February 1, 2023. A quarter of ZM's SBC expense was attributable to top-ups in FY25 (~$233M), which is down from one-third in FY24 (~$353M). This, therefore, suggests that FY25 SBC expenses excluding top-ups were $698M, 15% of revenue vs. 20% on a reported basis, and was down modestly from $705M in FY24 excluding

top-ups. For FY28 and beyond, ZM expects SBC as a percentage of revenue to be under 12%. In Q3, ZM reported 41% non-GAAP operating margins with 16% of revenue spent on SBC, suggesting 25% GAAP operating margins . In our base case, we are modeling non-GAAP operating margins to remain steady at 40% through FY28. With SBC as a % of revenue set to decline from 16% to <12% beyond FY28, we see a clear path for ZM to reach 30% GAAP operating margins assuming ZM does not do large-scale M&A. We also note management is not looking to have its margins trend towards its long-term target of 33-36% non-GAAP operating margins without an inflection in the company's growth rate.

AI is at the core of Zoom's business transformation. Its main AI product is called Zoom AI Companion , an intelligent assistant built into the platform that uses generative AI to help users with tasks like summarizing meetings, composing messages, and navigating chat threads. Companion works by understanding the context of meetings, chats, and recordings to generate insights, highlight key points, and perform follow-up actions .

▪ When it was first launched in September 2023, AI Companion 1.0 primarily addressed streamlined meeting management. Its main capability was automated meeting summaries , which offered participants clear, concise recaps of key takeaways and next steps. This initial step into AI within the Zoom ecosystem quickly became a core tool for knowledge management and post-meeting workflows. ▪ Use case : Someone could finish a 60-minute call and instantly get a summary of what was discussed, the decisions made, and even a rough draft of a follow-up email. It didn't yet understand much outside the meeting itself, but it saved people time by handling repetitive writing and recap tasks. ▪ Announced at Zoomtopia 2024, AI Companion 2.0 represented a major upgrade over the original. It introduced a persistent side-panel across the Zoom Workplace ecosystem (spanning across meetings, chat, docs, mail, and calendar) and added deeper context and action-oriented capabilities.

▪ Use case : Evolved from a note-taker into a true daily assistant. It provides users with a single, persistent side panel where they can track all elements of the platform . It pulls data from across the workspace (and connected apps like Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar [GOOG, Not Rated]). Furthermore, it can search the web for up-to-date answers, ask things like 'What were my action items from yesterday's sales call?' or 'Can you schedule time with that client next week?' and will tie into the upcoming Zoom Tasks to track and help complete tasks.

▪ Zoom AI Companion 3.0 was announced at Zoomtopia 2025 this past September, included at no additional cost for users of paid Zoom Workplace plans. Companion 3.0 will add agentic capabilities and will actively make suggestions, generate agendas and actionable items , and will integrate seamlessly across the platform. It also introduces a new low-code builder for custom AI agents and avatars, which allows organizations to build custom workflows and apps. ▪ Use case: Now, it is like having a smart coworker who manages your day for you. Instead of just summarizing meetings like earlier versions, it now looks at your calendar, chats, and past meetings to decide which ones actually need your attention . For example, it might tell you, 'You can skip the 3 PM check-in-here's what was discussed last week and what's already been done.' It can then generate a new agenda for your next call, notify the host you will review the summary instead, and automatically send you a recap with action items afterward. Exhibit 6: ZM's AI Companion Evolution

In its most recent quarter (3Q26), Zoom reported total revenue of $1.230B, representing 4.4% year-overyear growth. This performance was driven primarily by the momentum of its Enterprise business, which grew 6.1% year-over-year and accounted for 60.3% of total revenue . Meanwhile, ZM's online revenue grew 2.0% Y/Y (compared to 1.4% in Q2) with online average monthly churn of 2.7% which is in line with Q3 of last year and an all-time low. Exhibit 7: Base Case Suggests Revenue Growth Deceleration Source: BTIG Research Estimates, Company Reports

The company has continued to make strong progress in growing its base of large, high-value customers (those who contribute >$100k in TTM revenue). In the most recent quarter, the number of customers in this category grew 9.2% year-over-year (8.7% in Q2), reaching a total of 4,363. These large enterprise accounts have become an increasingly important strategic driver for Zoom , reflecting the company's ability to serve complex, multi-product deployments and upselling advanced offerings like Contact Center, Phone, Workvivo, and AI-powered solutions. Exhibit 8: ZM's Number of Customers Contributing >$100k in TTM Revenue Source: BTIG Research, Company Reports

Customers generating more than $100,000 in TTM revenue now account for 32.4% (as of 3Q26) of Zoom's overall revenue, up 160bps Y/Y. Zoom's enterprise revenue itself has grown 6.1% Y/Y and now represents 60.3% of total company revenue. But revenue from >$100K customers is growing at an even faster rate, growing 9.9% Y/Y. The strong growth in this category is supported by product expansion and elevated deal sizes, as larger organizations consolidate their communications, customer experience, and employee engagement needs onto the Zoom platform. Exhibit 9: ZM's Revenue from Customers Contributing >$100k in TTM Source: BTIG Research, Company Reports

By contrast, revenue from customers contributing less than $100,000 in TTM has grown at a slower rate over the last few quarters, coming in at 2.0% Y/Y growth in 3Q26. While it does not drive overall growth to the extent of the enterprise segment, the <$100k TTM customer base continues to provide a meaningful foundation of recurring revenue and supports Zoom's broader upsell and expansion strategy. Exhibit 10: ZM's Revenue from Customers Contributing <$100k in TTM Source: BTIG Research, Company Reports

Operating margin remains ahead of its stated long-term targets. In 3Q26, Zoom posted non-GAAP operating margin of 41.2%. In FY25, Zoom delivered non-GAAP operating margin of ~39%, above the 33% to 36% long-term range the company shared at Zoomtopia 2024. The strong margin performance has been driven by a combination of cost discipline and optimization in cloud infrastructure. The company continues to focus its Operating Expenses in strategic areas. Management has expressed an intention to grow the company's engineering and AI talent base , particularly by investing in dedicated AI centers (like the one in Seattle) and expanding headcount in roles that drive product innovation.

Zoom's margin profile has remained industry leading, even as the company has grown. From FY21 to FY25, non-GAAP operating margin improved from about 38% to around 39%. GAAP operating margin has fluctuated throughout the years but has increased in recent years as stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue has steadily declined. As of FY25, SBC margin was ~17%. At Zoomtopia 2025, management said that SBC margin was 'tracking one year ahead' of their dilution reduction target. The company's FCF margin has also rebounded in recent years, coming in at 39% for FY25, driven by revenue growth, operational efficiencies, and lower capex.
