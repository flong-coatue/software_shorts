Price objective basis & risk Zoom Video Communications (ZM) Our $84 PO is based on a CY26E EV/FCF multiple of 9.5x. The 9.5x multiple is a discount to the less than 10% growth software peer group trading at 18x. This discount is warranted based on ZM's weaker visibility with regards to future growth trajectory and an increasingly competitive xCaaS environment. Upside risks to our price objective are stabilization of the non-enterprise user base, successful penetration of enterprise phone and contact center and acquisition. Downside risks are greater-than-expected attrition of non-enterprise users, failed M&A, a prolonged economic downturn and heightened competitive pressure.

Zoom Video Communications AI, M&A, and competitive environment highlight 3Q call Main topics on Zoom ' s (ZM) 3Q earnings included 1) AI offerings, 2) 3Q results, 3) overall customer demand, and 4) M&A environment. M anagement highlighted the customer demand environment remains strong and Net Dollar Expansion was 98% in 3Q . ZM will remain ' disciplined ' in M&A and likely look for small to medium sized potential investments. The Board of Directors authorized an additional $1bn stock repurchase plan, incremental to the remaining $~310mn. ZM has repurchased ~$1.3bn of stock since the beginning of FY26. 3Q beat and FY26 guid ance raise Zoom's FY 3 Q26 results were better than projected with revenue and non-GAAP operating income 1 % and 8 % above BofA/ Street estimates. Enterprise revenues increase + 6 % y/y . Customers contributing >$100k of TTM revenue increased + 9 % q/q to 4, 363 (from 4, 274 ). Online average monthly churn was flat

y/y at 2. 7 % and declined q/q (vs. 2. 9 % in 2 Q). ZM provided 4 Q26 revenue guidance of $1. 213 bn at the mid ($1. 210 bn cc), slightly above consensus of $1. 2 27 bn. ZM increased its full year FY26 revenue guidance by ~ 0. 5 % (+0. 5 % cc) to $4. 855 bn at the mid, above consensus of $4. 8 33 bn. ZM increased its FCF outlook by ~6 .5% to $1. 87 0bn . BofA estimate revisions Following 3 Q results and management commentary, we are increasing our FY26 E and FY27 E revenue estimates by 0 . 4 % and 0 . 4 % respectively. We are also increasing our FY26 E and FY27 E EPS estimates by 2 . 2 % and 2. 6 % . Reiterate Neutral, $84 PO We reiterate our Neutral and $84 PO (unchanged) , which is now based on a CY26E EV/FCF multiple of 9. 5 x

(vs 9.7x prior to our adjusted FCF estimate on higher collections ) . The 9. 5 x multiple is a discount to the software peer group trading at 18 x. This discount is warranted, in our view, based on ZM's weaker visibility with regard to future growth trajectory.

Zoom provides a leading platform for video meetings and is positioned well to capture more wallet share with other forms of communication, in our view. However, as the pandemic subsides in 2022 and Zoom faces reopening headwinds with a broader slowdown in both new customer growth and expansion activity, and heightened Online churn. This provides little certainty as to the bottom for growth.
