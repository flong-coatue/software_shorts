4Q Preview: Positive Business Trends

In our view, SAP enters 2026 with good momentum. The business is on an uptrend despite recent stock weakness from investors reducing exposure to software names and modest growth deceleration in its current cloud backlog. Positively, SAP should be an AI winner from data gravity in ERP/financials which is mission-critical for operations, heavily integrated, and from high cloud gross margins. In our view, strong cloud and AI growth, combined with a successful business transformation, foretells a much larger, more profitable SAP over the medium term. Our Perform rating is based on valuation as multiples already reflect SAP's strong market position, accelerating revenue growth, and 30%+ EBIT margin trajectory. Please contact your OpCo sales representative to meet with SAP CTO Philipp Herzigon Feb. 12 in Palo Alto.

■ SAP reports 4Q25 results on 1/28. We estimate total revenue of €9.74B (+4% year/year) and €1.49 in PF EPS. Our research mosaic (IT spending survey, large partner conversations, competitor checks, and company-specific data) around deal activity, end of the year IT spending, AI momentum, pipeline growth, and performance weighed slightly positive for SAP's business in 4Q25, and we think points to modest upside to estimates. ■ Key themes. In our view, SAP management successfully restructured the business strategy and operating structure for the cloud and AI future. This is visible with accelerating revenue and EBIT margin growth. We believe the company has a defensible moat in AI from its Financials and ERP data gravity. The company also has high cloud margins (80% cloud and software gross margin in 3Q25).

■ Bull Case. SAP has a visible business reacceleration path as the company monetizes its large installed base with AI offerings, RISE, and S/4HANA migrations. Based on ongoing business transformation, our model shows 30%+ EBIT margins in the next few years. We believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from macroeconomic improvement across EMEA and/or APAC. Last, we think SAP's data gravity and moat within ERP/financial systems reinforce its long-term defensibility. ■ Bear Case. SAP is one of the more expensive stocks in software. The current cloud backlog growth is decelerating which suggests transition tailwinds are fading. Continuing transactional revenue softness signals share losses in certain markets like spend management. European regulatory risk is increasing as data, AI, and compliance frameworks tighten. Last, SAP financials may end 2025 at the low end of guidance.

TECHNOLOGY/SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS

■ Grows in line with the worldwide technology spending average ■ Operating and cash margins remain stable ■ Consistent execution in reported quarterly results ■ Consistent cash flow yield

■ Grows at a faster rate than the worldwide technology spending average ■ Signs of faster share gains in the applications market ■ Improvement in operating and cash margins ■ Top line and margin growth accelerates

SAP is one of the world's largest providers of enterprise software.

Because of its dominant ERP positioning, SAP represents a good choice for its enterprise customers to build a long-term IT application platform to run their mission-critical operations. SAP should continue to benefit from increasing secular spending on cloud, business intelligence, and mobile technologies. We expect better cloud business sentiment for SAP ahead with Concur included in the product offerings. New products like C/4HANA, S/4HANA, HANA and other cloud-based offerings should provide a long-term lift to growth rates. We expect more M&A given success of the Concur, Ariba, SuccessFactors, BusinessObjects, Sybase, and Hybris deals.

■ Management is presenting at industry conferences over the next several months ■ New product introductions that expand the total addressable market ■ Increasing traction with S/4HANA migrations and net new additions ■ Cyclical recovery in EMEA and/or emerging markets
