SAP is set to report its 4Q25 results on Thursday 29 January before market open. Our estimates are a tad above that of Visible Alpha consensus on revenues and EPS, but slightly below on operating margin. For FY26, our forecasts are above that of Visible Alpha. For 4Q25, we expect total revenues of €9.78bn (+9% yoy at constant currencies [cc]), o/w cloud revenues of €5.69bn (+26% cc), an EBIT margin of 28.0% (+190bp), and EPS of €1.61. Consensus calls for €9.74bn, €5.63bn, 28.3%, and €1.60, respectively.

For FY26, we forecast total revenues of €40.91bn (+12% cc), o/w cloud revenues of €26.19bn (+26% cc), an EBIT margin of 29.4% (+110bp), and EPS of €7.44. Consensus expects respectively €40.65bn, €25.94bn, 29.3%, and €7.12. Within 4Q25 results, we will focus on: 1) Current cloud backlog growth, which SAP expects to decelerate to +c.25% cc for FY25 (implying +c.20% cc for 4Q25) vs consensus of +26% cc; 2) Cloud ERP suite momentum, where consensus forecasts €4.92bn (+29% cc); 3) Ramp-up of AI (# of AI agents & use cases); and 4) Pace of margin increase due to focus on cost control.

While SAP is not immune to AI pressures, we think that SAP is much less exposed than investors' concerns. In this note, we argue why transactional systems (e.g. ERP & Supply Chain) will retain their value in the emerging AI-powered IT landscape, and why SAP will capture more revenues and maintain strategic control in the future. Indeed, we see AI today as more of a reason for customers to migrate to Cloud ERP suite as data is a center of gravity for AI.

SAP will report its 4Q25 results on Thursday 29 January before the market open. Our estimates are a touch above that of Visible Alpha consensus on revenues and EPS, but slightly below on operating margin (Exhibit 1). · We anticipate €9.78bn (+9% yoy at constant currencies [cc]) in total revenues, slightly above consensus of €9.74bn. On cloud revenues, we expect €5.69bn (+26% yoy cc), 1% above consensus of €5.63bn. On maintenance revenues, we forecast €2.49bn (-7% yoy cc), c.3% below consensus of €2.56bn. On software license revenues, we anticipate €478m (-33% yoy cc), c.6% above consensus of €453m. · Our non-IFRS operating margin is 28.0% (+190bp), 30bp below consensus of 28.3%. · Our basic non-IFRS EPS estimate is €1.61, c.1% above consensus of €1.60.

Visible Alpha expects current cloud backlog to grow c.26% yoy cc for FY25. Based on SAP management's comment, current cloud backlog growth rate is expected to slow slightly in FY25 to c.25% yoy cc, implying that 4Q25 growth would be c.20% yoy cc, which is a sharp deceleration compared to the first three quarters of the year (+28% yoy cc on average). However, management sounded quite confident that they will likely beat that 25% rate for FY25, and we believe a beat will be seen very positively by investors as Current Cloud Backlog is a key metric investors are watching. FX has become a key topic since 3Q25 given the depreciation of the US dollar against other major currencies, especially the euro. SAP has guided for worsening FX headwinds in 4Q25. We note that the company derives about 35% of its total revenues from the US and an important percentage of its contracts in other regions are also priced/linked to the US dollar.

· On total revenues, we forecast €40.91bn (+c.12% yoy cc), c.1% above consensus of €40.65bn. This primarily stems from our higher estimates in cloud revenues - €26.19bn (+26% yoy cc) vs consensus of €25.94bn - and software licenses - €813m (-25% yoy cc) vs consensus of €779m. · On cloud and software revenues, our estimate is €36.58bn vs consensus of €36.39bn. · We anticipate an operating margin of 29.4% (+110bp), 10bp above that consensus of 29.3%. · On current cloud backlog growth, Visible Alpha consensus expects +24% yoy cc.

While SAP provides its outlook at constant currencies, the company usually provides also its estimated FX impact for both the current quarter and the year for revenues and operating income. Since 3Q25, FX became much more of a headwind, and it could get incrementally worse in 1H26.

Recent earnings publications and guidances from major software and services providers - e.g. Oracle, Accenture, TCS, Infosys, and HCL - as well as IT spending surveys from various market researchers - e.g. Gartner Group, IDC, Enterprise Technology Research - have pointed to a more robust demand environment in 4Q25 and further improvement in corporate IT spending in 2026. In fact this was a key takeaway in our recent CIO survey and in our call with 3 CIOs (Link). We note that since 2024, despite a relatively lackluster economy and persistent weakness at its transactional business (representing in total less than €1bn in annual revenues, including Concur and Fieldglass) SAP has grown its total revenues at a double-digit rate on average at constant currencies (Exhibit 7) and steadily improve its operating margin (Exhibit 8).

In their most recent fiscal quarters, major ERP software providers like Oracle, Microsoft and Workday (all three covered by M. Moerdler) have reported robust revenue growth for their respective ERP businesses (Exhibit 9, Exhibit 10, and Exhibit 11). They have not flagged any major changes in customers' purchasing patterns, which is encouraging, in our view, for SAP as its Cloud ERP suite will face tough comps in 4Q25 (4Q24 +35% yoy cc, the second-best quarter in FY24). Our discussions with major services providers - e.g. Accenture, TCS, Infosys (all three not covered) and Deloitte - regarding their respective ERP practices have also pointed to a relatively healthy demand environment for SAP's Cloud ERP solutions.

We note that SAP's Cloud ERP revenues, despite a larger revenue base when compared to peers, have consistently reported faster growth relative to its competitors over the past three years (Exhibit 12), underpinned by a strong multi-year product migration cycle with S/4-Cloud ERP suite. For instance, in the most recent fiscal quarter Oracle generated c.$2bn in ERP revenues - split evenly between Fusion ERP and NetSuite - and Workday more than $2.2bn in subscription revenues. SAP's Cloud ERP suite had more than €4.5bn in revenues in 3Q25. Source: SAP (FY to end-December), Bernstein analysis

Visible Alpha consensus currently forecasts +24% yoy cc for FY26 vs FY25's +26% yoy cc expected. This is broadly in line with SAP's guidance since the beginning of 2025 for a gradual deceleration going forward. Moreover, 2H25 current cloud backlog growth will be negatively impacted by >1p due to higher comps from the WalkMe acquisition that closed in 3Q24.

In our view, this slowing current cloud backlog growth expected for FY25 onward is a natural progression in SAP's cloud transition, because of a) the low-hanging fruits happen first, and the more complex migration takes more time, and b) the law of large numbers (e.g. 3Q25 cloud backlog €18.8bn). While SAP's Cloud ERP Suite becomes rapidly a larger proportion of cloud revenues (3Q25 87% vs FY24 83%) and total revenues (3Q25 51% vs FY24 41%), SAP's overall revenue growth will accelerate, even though Cloud ERP Suite revenue growth slows incrementally. Moreover, SAP's Cloud ERP Suite revenue growth is substantially outpacing that of major ERP software competitors and the ERP market.

In 3Q25, current cloud backlog growth was +27% yoy cc, at a similar pace to cloud revenue growth of +27% yoy cc (Exhibit 13 andExhibit 14). It slowed 1pp sequentially vs 2Q25's +28% yoy cc, mostly due to prolonged closing of deals under heightened macro uncertainties. Based on historical patterns regarding the migration of existing ECC customers to S/4 - and now Cloud ERP Suite, we believe ECC clients will represent a larger percentage of Cloud ERP Suite customers in 4Q25. As ECC clients tend to be large organizations, this should help bolster SAP's 4Q25 current cloud backlog and FY26 revenue prospects, in our view. Furthermore, we note that SAP management stated on the 3Q25 earnings call that there was a marked improvement in the qualified pipeline and pipeline conversion rates, notably in manufacturing and US public sector.

SAP targets 40 AI agents by the end of 2025 against 14 at end-1H25. The group aims to deliver 400 Generative AI use cases by end-2025 vs c.150 at end-June. In 3Q25, the large majority of SAP's cloud order entry volume came from deals that include Generative AI/Agentic AI use cases. Today, we continue to see SAP's AI features as more of a reason for customers to migrate to the cloud rather than a major revenue driver, even if we are keen to have any AI-related revenue data that SAP may disclose.

Since the summer, investors have increasingly perceived AI as a threat for software companies, causing a sharp de-rating for software stocks - e.g. SAP's share price down c.19% over the past six months. Some investors argue that applications such as ERP or CRM getting un-bundled, and potentially bypassed, through systems of big data (e.g. Databricks, Snowflake), systems of flexibility (e.g. agentic workflow and orchestration), and systems of intelligence (e.g. knowledge graphs and intelligent apps like Palantir). This means workers will work through a 'library' of AI agents, that seamlessly span systems, rather logging into SAP or Salesforce. In this vision for an Agentic AI-powered architecture, there is a three-tier enterprise IT stack emerging:

· Execution layer at the bottom, powered by transactional systems like SAP or Oracle in finance, Workday in finance and HR, and Salesforce for sales. They execute workflows with proper audit trails, compliance framework, and business logic. · Orchestration layer in the middle, where reside data platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks. This layer unifies data across transactional systems and providing context for AI decision-making. · Intelligence layer at the top, which host AI agents that understand requests in natural language, pull context from data layers, and execute workflows through transactional systems. While this architecture may theoretically make sense, we believe that investors may underestimate some important questions: in a company, does this architectural vision map onto the organizational/operational structures in place - i.e. who owns what, who pays for what, and where value actually accrues?

For instance, transactional applications (e.g. ERP, CRM) are generally owned by departmental buyers - finance/accounting for SAP/Oracle ERP, HR for Workday, sales/marketing for Salesforce. These teams control their budgets, and can justify their spending based on direct productivity gains in their respective areas. On the other hand, data platforms generally report to CIO ou CDO (Chief Data Officer), and funded from analytics budgets. These teams are measured on data quality, insights delivered, and cost efficiency. They do not own user-facing applications, and would struggle to justify any spending on infrastructure that enables other teams. So, who is going to pay for this architecture envisioned by some IT vendors? Data teams do not have the budget for operational transformation. Departmental application owners will not pay for cross-system infrastructure. Therefore, while the vision makes sense, we believe that it will take time to figure out how to effectively fund it and deploy it within an organization.

In addition, IT does not have understand the data context or the business processes and without this knowledge and information one can not really leverage Agentic AI to replace complex business systems.

Source: SAP (FY to end-December), Bernstein analysis In this context, we would argue that transactional systems retain their value in the emerging AI-powered landscape, and SAP will still capture revenues and maintain strategic control in the future . In our view, transactional software vendors have several key advantages:

· They own the system of record . T o achieve accuracy and veracity, an AI agent needs to verify the data. Any verification requires linking back to the authoritative systems - e.g. SAP for finance/accounting, Workday for employee records, Salesforce for customer data. Agentic AI makes these systems become even more important. · They own workflow execution capability . Data platforms like Databricks can store and analyze data, but they cannot execute business processes with proper approval chains, audit trails, state management, and integration with downstream systems. When an AI agent needs to actually do something - e.g. approve a deal, create a purchase order, update a customer/employee record - it needs a transactional system. · They own the integration infrastructure via connectors to other systems. They understand how data flows across the organization, and manage the complexity of cross-system workflows. This is not easy to replicate.

· They own the user relationship . Finance staff has invested in SAP, trained users on it, and built processes around it. Even if AI changes the interface, this relationship and organizational ownership still exist. These advantages are crucial in regulated industries like financial services, pharmaceuticals or healthcare, or any industry with governance and compliance requirements. They need audit trails, role-based access control, data residency and sovereignty, explainability, etc. A simple data cloud that one queries for tasks is not enough in this context. This is where transactional systems hold a decisive advantage because they have these governance frameworks built in, tested, and auditor-approved.

There is also the governance and risk components, especially as it relates to ERP and HCM where any inaccuracy within the data can cause meaningful regulatory issues. In the discussion the Global Software team has held in the governance, risk and legal departments of organizations the concerns over handing over control of this most critical data to AI is quite substantial especially if the systems are outside the control of traditional vetted providers.

We believe that vertical, industry-specific platforms will add further complication. For instance, in supply chain, SAP Ariba is not simply a transactional system. It is a complete platform with its own data layers, analytics, workflow engines, and increasingly its own AI capabilities. They span procurement, inventory management, logistics, and supplier management. The same applies for platforms in manufacturing (Siemens, PTC), healthcare (Oracle Cerner), or financial services (FIS). These platforms are vertically integrated platforms with deep domain expertise, critical for business processes. We do not believe that they will be reduced to API endpoints for some horizontal AI agent layer in the near future.

While we believe that SAP will retain a key role in the emerging AI-powered landscape thanks to its own Agentic AI offerings, deep integration within its ecosystem, and strategic transactional role, another important question that needs to be asked would be whether SAP can credibly orchestrate beyond its domain? We think that enterprises will probably end up with multiple orchestration layers - e.g. Microsoft Copilot for knowledge work, ServiceNow for IT and operations, Salesforce for customer processes, SAP for finance processes, and vertical platforms for their respective areas. Another key question, in our view, is where does value accrue in this emerging three-tier stack? We believe that applications will capture value because they have direct user relationships, measurable productivity gains, and clear business outcomes . For instance, Salesforce can charge for AI features that improves sales productivity, SAP for supply chain efficiency.

Data is critical and system of record data is most critical when dealing with Gen AI and Agentic AI, and we believe that organizations are predominantly going to leverage AI from within their traditional enterprise applications rather than outside the control of those systems.

The strong momentum of revenue growth - above 30% yoy cc on average over the past two years - at SAP Cloud ERP suite indicates, in our view, that the transition from SAP ECC and new customer acquisition have been well executed despite a relatively lackluster macro environment. We estimate that about c.20k SAP ECC clients (i.e. c.50% of the installed base) are yet to upgrade to Cloud ERP suite (Exhibit 15). As the 2027 deadline is fast approaching, and 4Q has usually seen the highest number of ECC clients migrating to S/4 based on the patterns seen over the past three years, we believe that SAP could have a strong 4Q25 in terms of upgrade with most customers likely to acquire the cloud version (Exhibit 16).

In terms of new customer acquisition, we believe that SAP should continue to perform well (Exhibit 17). As most, if not all, large organizations - traditionally SAP's primary customers - have already been equipped with ERPs, we think that SAP's S/4 new customers are likely mid-sized companies coming from the supply chain of organizations which are already SAP's customers. We estimate that ERP accounted for c.28% of SAP's software revenues in 2024 vs c.25% for supply chain solutions (Exhibit 18). We note that SMBs account for c.30% of SAP's total revenues, and the company is making important efforts to increase its presence in this strategic market.

When compared to Visible Alpha consensus, SAP beat expectations on software license sales by 18% in 1Q25 and 5% in 2Q25, but missed by 22% in 3Q25 (Exhibit 19). While these revenue beats were modest in terms of absolute amount, they still helped SAP's profitability, as these licenses carry a 70-75% gross margin. Moreover, greater resilience in license sales also helps future maintenance revenues (Exhibit 20), which carry a 90%-plus gross margin. For 4Q25, we anticipate €478m (-33% cc) in license sales vs consensus of €453m (-36% cc). EXHIBIT 19: SAP: software license revenues Source: SAP (FY to end-December), Bernstein analysis

SAP will continue to increase its gross and operating margins (Exhibit 21), in our view, driven by continued improvement in cloud gross margin (Exhibit 22), as well as good execution on cost control and greater operational efficiency, through its various programs and adoption of AI/Generative AI. We know that SAP has held extensive discussion with Microsoft on their Cloud journey and understands how to drive OPEX growth slower than revenue growth. We think that management will focus even more on operational efficiency given the persistently weak macro environment.

SAP's share price has declined c.19% over the past six months, largely due to investors' concerns about AI with some concern about the rate of Cloud migrations slowing (as discussed above) and how much is still left to move to the Cloud. The pullback in the share price could present an attractive entry point for long-term investors, in our view. The value of the business model, its expanding AI offerings, and SAP's ability to execute - backlog not negatively impacted by poor macro environment - underpin our positive view for FY26 and beyond. We continue to believe that SAP is a quality compounder. We reiterate our Outperform on SAP as we believe that the company should continue to deliver one of the best risk/reward profiles in our software coverage in this market.
