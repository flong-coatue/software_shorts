Europe North America Technology IT Software & Services Industry

Our industry conversations as well as third party survey and industry data point to a healthy year of growth for Software and some bottoming out of IT services demand trends ahead. The vast majority of our customer discussions pointed to at least stable but more likely improving spending on Software into 2026e which is consistent with third party forecasts expecting a slight growth acceleration (towards ~15% Software industry growth) this year. While trends somewhat differ in Infrastructure and Security Software (which has limited relevance for the European SITS sector - see our US team's '26 outlook here for more detail), we see scope for improving growth momentum for major application Software companies in Europe going into 2026. Enterprise Software should see some catch-up effects following tariff/trade-conflict related pipeline pushouts in 2025 and our industry conversations point to continued investment needs by corporates to upgrade legacy IT systems with relatively more confidence expressed by EMEA enterprises on 2026 budget growth than in other regions.

Increasing adoption of AI features with bundled pricing should drive some initial monetization and support overall solution package pricing while ensuring adoption is not hindered by charging too much for AI on a standalone basis (e.g. Microsoft Copilot where sales targets have reportedly been cut in December) during what we see as an ongoing 'use case exploration' phase at corporates. We believe SAP is on a good trajectory here, striking the right balance between driving adoption (most important currently in our view) and monetization where we see more scope

longerterm than now once adoption has materialized and use cases/ROI are clearly defined. Sage in contrast is likely to see growth tailwinds this year from Copilot monetization but could somewhat limit adoption by charging too much too early, based on our industry conversations. We see the Engineering Software space still as relatively unaffected by AI efforts (both in terms of monetization as well as disruption risks) with several projects in the pipeline across major players but relatively less market-ready AI tools compared to Enterprise Software.

with the help of AI coding tools has limitations in horizontal software with areas that touch finance/ERP/manufacturing probably relatively well shielded. Having said that, we believe the Software sector could still struggle near-term in terms of share price performance given bullish sentiment around AI hardware/semiconductors/ infrastructure (further fueled by TSMC's impressive 2026 CapEx outlook) where near-term monetization of AI is straightforward and driving very meaningful earnings growth with Software seen by many as a 'funding short' even if most investors we have spoken to are not buying into a meaningful AI disruption bear case. We believe this could change over the course of 2026 and into 2027 as we see improving growth and profitability/FCF with potential for positive estimate revisions in our preferred stocks while we expect some major players in this space to provide more line of sight on how AI monetization could look

longer-term following the current adoption/use case discovery phase. Our Software top pick SAP has all those potential ingredients plus scope for cash returns and we remain constructive especially into Sapphire 2026 in May. In IT Services we continue to like Capgemini where we see expectations as low around AI (with scope for some contract wins which could improve sentiment) and consensus expectations correctly set. In SMIDs, we like the setup for Mensch und Maschine into Q4 but are more cautious on ATOSS Software given some guidance risk.

Within large-cap Software , we expect a solid Q4 for SAP following a softer Q3 which was adversely impacted mostly by uncertainties around the trade environment following liberation day. We see SAP's deal pipeline normalizing and some contracts that have been pushed out to 2026 have returned to Q4, in our view. Still, with Q4 usually being relatively back-end loaded around the weeks running up to Christmas, there remains some potential volatility especially given a pipeline with several larger deals in it this quarter, in our view. We see current Cloud backlog (CCB) growth for Q4 at 25-26% while expecting a continued strong evolution of total Cloud backlog (TCB - capturing SAP's longer-term pipeline with an average duration of ~5 years) at >30% as the company continues to build long-term revenue growth visibility on the back of multi-year Cloud migrations, new

customer acquisitions, especially in the mid-market, and AI projects. Beyond CCB and TCB, we believe the market focus to be mostly on SAP's 2026 guidance where we expect ~11% group cc revenue growth, ~24.5% Cloud cc revenue growth, ~E11.8b operating profit (29.5% margin) and E9.4b FCF, broadly in-line to slightly above consensus. In terms of messaging, we expect management to point to a continued gradual moderation of CCB growth in percentage terms (similar as when entering FY25) but a sustained acceleration of group growth into FY27e (DBe 12.5% from ~10% in FY25e). For Sage, we expect a positive trading update on FQ1 with strong Q4 momentum carrying through into H1/26e, driven by Intacct (esp. in the US) and initial Copilot monetization. Focus will be on ARR where normal seasonality is +2% q/q growth. We believe Amadeus can reach the low end of its guidance while tweaking its FY26 outlook slightly

below its mid-term guidance (announced at CMD in 2024). That said, market speculation regarding Amadeus' ability to defend its market position against Al-native solutions has pressured the valuation in recent months. While we believe Amadeus could ultimately benefit from broader Al developments, we see headline risk limiting near-term upside and remain cautious. In Engineering Software , we continue to remain selective as macro trends remain mixed while major verticals and regions such as Automotive and China continue to see headwinds. For PTC, we expect a relatively in-line FQ1 but continued relative outperformance against major peer Dassault. We anticipate a slow end to the year We value the sector on a mix of P/E, EV/ uFCF, EV/EBIT(DA), DCF and SOTP valuations, benchmarking multiples vs. peers' and/or expected growth rates. Key sector risks include macro, FX, regulation, new technologies, potentially valuedestructive M&A and market-share shifts.

for Dassault as we see revenue inching towards the low-end of their guide, with some large deals in automotive that have likely slipped to Q1/Q2, Medidata continuously down in the quarter and Centric facing tough comps, which are all not fully offset by a solid performance in Industrial Innovation. While we expect some improvement from cost savings, this is rather a story into 2026. Likewise, while cash flows will likely be poor in Q4, we expect the reversal from the delayed cash payments to net off the poor performance only in Q1/26. For 2026 we expect Dassault to initially guide with some conservatism, likely with revenue growth in cc to be in the 5-7% range, with up/downside to it depending on large deal conversions. Hexagon will likely see Q4 trends relatively similar to the soft Q3 with some moderate scope for improvement but headwinds in China (Auto, Infra) likely weighing on RemainCo performance while Octave's sluggish growth should continue for several quarters given the ongoing SaaS transition and

demand volatility in its software lease business. On the robotics side, we are hoping for somewhat of an update with Q4 results given limited recent news on additional trial partners for Aeon. Nemetschek faces a challenging Q4 with tough comps, especially in Design due to last year's one-offs from last time Graphisoft license sales and a higher proportion of multi-year subscription contracts. While much appears priced in and consensus does not look overly ambitious, we hence remain on the sidelines.

In IT services , we continue to like Capgemini, as we believe the guidance is derisked. Moreover, we believe Cap could benefit from WNS as BPO showed a strong rebound in Q4 (Strongest quarter since Q1/24), according to ISG index. A trend that we expect to continue in 2026. Currently, we are modeling 3.5% organic growth for FY26. That said, with a stable macro environment, we see some potential upside from IT infrastructure modernization prior to a broader AI and Gen-AI adoption which should help with sentiment as well. We expect Reply to build on margin expansion through FY25 in Q4, forecasting Q4 adj EBITDA margin of 21.0% (cons 20.6%). Reply shares fell -25% in 2025, with slower organic growth (tariff disruption) coinciding with debate on generative and Agentic AI. In our view, Reply is well placed to capitalise on the opportunity to help customers further their AI agendas and, in the last quarter, management highlighted good adoption

in Banking, Energy & utilities and traction for Reply's pre-built apps, with AI starting to move to scale in some cases. Nonetheless, we believe a recovery in IT discretionary spend remains the key determinant of near-term organic growth. On resellers, we continue to prefer Bechtle (well positioned to benefit from a German IT spending pick-up) over Cancom and SoftwareONE. On the latter, we remain cautious as we do not expect the Dec. budget flush which usually play a role in the company's guidance and could impose a risk. Moreover we believe the market needs further clarity on integration progress, North America turnaround as well as PF financial disclosure.

Within SMID-cap names in our coverage , we like the setup for Mensch und Maschine (MuM), which we recently initiated coverage on. We expect the company to return to its normal trajectory of robust growth from Q4/25 onwards and anticipate excellent y/y growth in Q4, which should enable the company to achieve the low end of its full-year guidance. With some market participants expressing skepticism about MuM's ability to achieve the lower end of guidance and the stock trading ~35% below its 10-year median EV/EBIT multiple, we believe risk/reward is tilted to the upside for the name and we expect a re-rating of shares once MuM resumes its robust growth trajectory, commencing in Q4/25. While we like MuM into Q4 results, we are more cautious on ATOSS Software near-term as we believe the company will provide a cautious FY26 guidance, below current market

expectations. As detailed in our preview published last week, we think the company might revise its FY26 revenue guidance to "around" E215m (from the current midterm guidance for "at least" E215m), while we also expect a cautious EBIT margin guidance of ≥32% (versus DBe 33.5% for FY26). While we do believe the guidance would again provide room for upgrades throughout the year, it would most likely be below current market expectations, which we think might lead to some disappointment on the day of results. For Buy-rated Ocado, we expect the company to deliver against its guidance in FY'25, specifically 10% growth in Tech Solutions with a 25% adj. EBITDA margin and underlying FCF outflow of -£200m. Whilst all eyes will be on FY26 guidance post the re-basing of the Kroger relationship, ultimately it will be about how confident investors can be on the group winning new contracts/customers as exclusivities roll off and as the group deploys

new fulfilment products that brings its tech to a wider range of applications. Among Hold-rated names, AutoStore has been reporting gradual stabilisation/ improvements in the last two quarters and we expect this trend to have broadly continued, adjusted for the strong comparator in Q4'24 when the group pulled forward some orders. After two years of revenue declines (FY24: -7%, FY25e: -16%), we believe investors are looking for credible signs that it can return to growth in FY26 (we forecast 6% growth) and can compete strongly against other types of automation solutions in what is still an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. For Netcompany, we anticipate a softer end to the year driven by an elongation of sales cycles and a delay in spending decisions in the public space, particularly

in Denmark (Q4 elections) and in the UK (DALAS project). On the margin front we expect a better performance in 2026 as they have spent quite a fair amount of FTEs (c. 100) on product and business development that were not directly billing. We remain cautious in the near term on the exposure that NETC holds on the ITS public and private sector as we see challenges from both a geopolitical and a decline in industry spend standpoint. Temenos and Teamviewer have pre-released last week already. For Temenos, we see this year end as a strong one where in this current enterprise software environment a 10% grower with 15% FCF growth

and expanding margins should warrant a premium. That said, even though we are marginally more positive on the name, we still need to see where 2026 guide will land and how lumpy the pipeline will be in the coming quarters. We acknowledge the strong end to the year and welcome management commentary on the sales environment being stable, which cannot be said the same for the rest of the enterprise software market, with a good number of new logos signed in the quarter. For Teamviewer, which came in at the very low end of revenue guidance, we welcome positive commentary on continued momentum in Enterprise, but we suspect 1E's performance will continue to weigh on the fundamentals in 2026, particularly on SMB.

We expect Amadeus to deliver E1,611m in revenues for Q4 FY25, supported by continued robust air traffic demand as reported by IATA. We expect Air Distribution revenues to grow 6.4% cc y/y to E741m, despite bookings showing some weakness in October versus Q3 and November being slightly disrupted in North America, mainly on the back of unitary revenue growth of 0.7% to E6.47. We expect

bookings to grow 2.8% y/y to 114.5m. In Air IT, Amadeus reported improved trends in Q3, which we expect to continue in Q4 (excluding a few days of disruption in North America). We therefore model 2.8% y/y growth in PB. We expect unitary revenue to increase 4.8% cc y/y to E1.10, resulting in Air IT revenues growing 7.7% cc y/y to E595m. For the HOS segment, we expect the strong momentum from Q3 to persist, with growth accelerating sequentially to 11.5% cc y/y and revenues reaching E274m. Overall, we are slightly below consensus in HOS, while for the other divisions and at group level we are forecasting results toward the lower end of guidance. We assume a broadly in-line cost structure and model a gross margin of 73.9%, with EBITDA of E563m.

While management has reiterated mid-term guidance (2023-26) in cc, we expect FY26 guidance to come in slightly lower. For FY26, we model growth of 6.8% in Air Distribution, 6.4% in Air IT, and 12.8% in HOS. That said, we do not view potential guidance adjustments as the primary risk to the Amadeus investment case. Instead, headline risk around Al has weighed on the stock over the past year. Market speculation regarding Amadeus' ability to defend its market position against Alnative solutions has pressured the valuation in recent months. While we believe Amadeus could ultimately benefit from broader Al developments, we believe clearer and more proactive

communication from the company is needed to help the market better understand how Amadeus can be a beneficiary of Al, particularly in the context of its data scale, customer integration, and mission-critical positioning. In the absence of such clarity, we struggle to identify near-term upside and do not see an attractive risk/reward profile at present. We value Amadeus on a simple average of 18.3x '26 P/E and 21.1x '26 EV/uFCF. We kept our discount to average of peers unchanged reflecting the risks above. As a result of changing peer multiples, our TP falls to E64 (previously at E68). Hold.

ATOSS is scheduled to release its provisional FY25 figures on January 30th. While we anticipate a solid finish to FY25, the focus will be on the FY26 guidance, where we expect ATOSS to provide a conservative outlook that, while likely representing a lower boundary and leaving room for upgrades throughout the year, could be met with some disappointment on the day of the results. Specifically, we believe ATOSS could slightly adjust its current FY26 revenue guidance from "at least" E215m to a more conservative "around" E215m. This comes as the current FY26 target was set when the company also aimed for "at least" E190m in FY25 (revised to ~E190m

with Q1/25), and with FY25 revenue now likely to come in closer to E188-190m, the leap to "at least" E215m in FY26 could be viewed as quite a stretch. For the FY26 EBIT margin, we expect ATOSS to again guide conservatively for ≥32% (compared to DBe for 34% in FY25 and 33.5% in FY26), with the slight margin contraction driven by the mechanical effect of costs related to new hires in H2/25 only being fully in the run rate in FY26.

For FY25, we project revenues of ~E189m, representing ~11% growth y/y, primarily driven by the cloud business (+27% y/y). This is supported by a strong ARR of E~134m at Q3/25 and a robust cloud order backlog (i.e., revenues from contractually secure cloud usage fees for the next 12 months), which stood at ~E102m at Q3/25. With this, we expect the share of recurring revenues to reach ~70% of FY25 sales (vs. 65% in FY24). Regarding profitability, we believe ATOSS will achieve an EBIT margin of 34.5%, slightly exceeding its revised guidance of 34%, driven by scaling effects within the cloud business and prudent cost management.

Looking at 2026, ATOSS should benefit from the significant transformation of its sales organization, largely completed in 2025. This involved implementing more efficient sales processes to bolster demand generation and lead qualification, alongside new sales hires, which should become fully up and running throughout FY26. With regards to ATOSS' internationalization, we expect particular progress in France, where ATOSS aims to secure 1-3 wins among large multinational

corporations. Furthermore, ATOSS will increasingly focus on accelerating the cloud migration and actively "pushing" existing maintenance customers to the cloud, which should provide a nice growth tailwind over the coming years (refer to our recent CFO roadshow feedback for details). We therefore believe ATOSS can reaccelerate revenue growth in the years ahead, with ~13% y/y revenue growth in FY26 (versus ~11% in FY25). However, we still anticipate the company to prudently adjust its current FY26 revenue guidance to "around" E215m from the current midterm target of "at least" E215m in FY26, which was initially set when ATOSS also aimed for "at least" E190m in FY25 (versus the current "around" E190m).

While we are more cautious into Q4 results given the potential guidance adjustment, we maintain our positive long-term view on the stock. Looking beyond 2026, R&D and S&M investments should enable ATOSS to capitalize on the significant long-term growth potential of the cloud-based and higher-end WFM market ATOSS is focusing on. More efficient sales operations and faster progress in the cloud migration should lead to a reacceleration of revenue growth in the years ahead (DBe for 13% and 14% in FY26 and FY27 versus 11% in FY25), while scaling effects in the cloud business should lead to reaccelerating, best-in-class margins beyond FY26 (DBe mid-30s). With updated peer multiples, we slightly lowered our TP to E135 (from E140) recently.

AutoStore will be reporting its Q4/FY25 results on February 12. For Q4'25, we are looking for order intake of $155.7m (consensus: $155m), revenues of $144.2m, 13% yoy (consensus: $148m), adj. EBITDA of $63.7m (margin of 44.2%, consensus: $68m) and adj. PBT of $44.7m. For the full year, we are looking for revenues of $502.9m (-16% yoy), adj. EBITDA of $213.8m (margin of 40.8%) and adj. PBT of $132.3m. Note that as in the previous few quarters, the group has not provided any guidance.

In Q3, order intake, revenue, adj. EBITDA were all stable/slightly up QoQ (seasonally we would have typically expected a weaker Q3 vs. Q2). Q3 revenue and adj. EBITDA were still down yoy, but the declines are much more reduced than the start of the year. The group talked about a steady recovery in the apparel and sports vertical (c.20% of revenues, higher in previous periods), though this remains below historical levels. The Q3 performance was also underpinned by

demand from industrial, healthcare and 3PL segments, which combined account for 44% of revenues. We would expect these trends to have continues/improved. Our revenue forecasts for Q4 suggest a yoy decline of -13% even though Q3 was down -4%. As a reminder, the group is facing a strong comparator having finished FY'24 strongly. At that time, the group indicated some deals in Q1'25 were pulled forward into the quarter so the group finished FY24 with $601m of revenues vs. guidance at that time of $575-600m. Adjusting for this, our Q4'25 revenue forecast decline is similar/ slightly better than the Q3'25 revenue decline.

We like the warehouse automation space and believe AutoStore has proven solutions from which its customers clearly derive value as evidenced by the level of repeat orders (55% of Q3 orders came from existing customers) and continues to win new logos (c.50 in Q3). Innovation is continuing, with new products and features being launched, whilst keeping a tight control on costs. Revenue momentum remains key to boost confidence in the medium-term growth prospects of this business. The last 5 years has seen revenue growth of FY21: +80%, FY22: +78%, FY23: +11%, FY24: -7% and FY25e: -16%. Investor are looking for credible signs that it can start to grow again in FY26 (we forecast +6% yoy).

AutoStore systems are capex investments ($1-2m for the standard end; c.$10m for high throughput end). Confidence in the macroeconomic backdrop is a key driver for deals and for backlog conversion to start going back to historic levels. We do believe the worst is behind them but would like to see faster growth and build confidence that it is taking share from other forms of automation (e.g. shuttle) again.

Dassault reports FY25 on the 11th of February in what we anticipate being a slow end to the year as we see revenue inching towards the low-end of their guide. From our checks we found that automative although being a tailwind for Soldiworks' sub transition, there are still some large deals that have likely slipped to Q1/Q2 that won't allow Dassault to come in the mid-to-high end of their guide. We expect Medidata continuously down in the quarter likely LSD negative growth and Centric to face tough comps. Industrial innovation performance will likely net off some of the negatives in Medidata and Centric, however CATIA's slipped large deals are also going to cause some top-line pressure, that is given in Q4 of last year we saw Airbus and Lockheed Martin deals signed giving it a tough c. E70m comp. That said, we

see MBSE demand increasing and that requests for broader designs encompassing the entire product rather than individual elements of it to be a net tailwind in the midterm, we thus are bullish on CAD demand and MBSE expansion. Now, on margins we expect some cost savings from an internal restructuring to consolidate some brands, specifically 3DX and NetVibes. We see Dassault pushing a view that 3DX is more than a PLM but a real MBSE approach to design. Now, we thus expect Dassault to come on the low end of their revenue guide for the year. But on margins we expect some improvement from cost savings, particularly into 2026, where 5060bps p.a. we view as achievable with revenue growth in the MSD. Furthermore, although cash flows will be bad in Q4 we expect the reversal from the delayed cash payments to net off the poor performance in Q1/26. For 2026 we expect the company to initially guide with some conservatism, likely with revenue

growth in cc to be in the 5-7% range, with up/downside to it depending on large deal conversions. We cut out TP from E30 to E27 to reflect our cut in EPS estimates for 2026 by c. 4% as well as some recent downward stock price movements from a weaker sentiment in the market. Our valuation is based on a 50/50 blend of 2026 P/E & EV/uFCF of c. 20x and 22x respectively, at a discount to peers to reflect lower revenue and earnings growth. Hold.

Hexagon is set to release its Q4/25 results on 30th January and we are entering a likely eventful year for the company with high expectations around the Aeon humanoid robot project, progress of the cost-cutting program under new management, the anticipated spin-off of Octave as well as CMDs from both RemainCo and Octave in April 2026.

For Q4/25, we expect 3% y/y organic growth which is similar compared to Q3. With strong FX headwinds, we expect total revenue to decline -1% y/y. For Q4/25, we forecast total revenue of E1,427m, slightly below cons. at E1,435m. Based on the new reporting, we expect Geosystems to post a 6% y/y decline with weakness in the sensor & robotic solution portfolio expected to continue and a weak construction end market, especially in China infrastructure. We expect Octave to improve sequentially but decline 4.5% y/y in Q4/25 on a higher base with the SaaS transition continuing to take time while we see near-term volatility on the software leasing business. In the Autonomous Solutions division, we expect 33.0% y/y growth as we see strong activity in the aerospace & defense and mining sectors to continue while

the Septentrio acquisition should boost overall growth, which might be partially offset by some weakness in agriculture markets. For Manufacturing Intelligence, we expect 6.0% y/y decline in Q4/25 due to a weak end market environment especially in Auto where we believe trends in China have likely worsened recently (with BYD being Hexagon's largest customer overall, in our view, but still at low single-digit percentage contribution to group revenues). On profitability, we forecast operating margin to improve q/q to reach 29.0% (in-line with cons at 29.1%) but ~200 bps lower y/y due to significant FX headwinds and weaker volumes. For FY25, we expect organic revenue growth of ~2.0% y/. However, we expect significant FX headwinds to result in an overall flat y/y revenue. In terms of profitability, we expect operating margins to reach 27.1% which is a ~260 bps contraction y/y.

The company's overall strategy to streamline its businesses with a focus on core areas as well as an entry into the robotics business looks promising and might unlock some value for shareholders in the future. Here, we note that the company recently announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft in pursuit of advancing its Humanoid robot capabilities and reach. On the other hand, updates and especially further announcements of trial partners since the robotics event in fall in Zurich have remained sparse. We remain on the sidelines on the stock, given headwinds in some major end markets while we expect the Octave turnaround to require some time (and likely product investments, in our view) and further patience while we would like to see more proof-points on commercial traction for Aeon in robotics.

We lower our target price to SEK110 (from SEK115) as we lower our EPS estimates by ~2%/~3% for FY26/27, respectively. We value Hexagon using a SOTP valuation after the company's proposed split of the ALI and a few other businesses into a NewCo (now named Octave) and recent D&E business sale to Cadence for EUR2.7bn. We apply a FY26e EV/EBIT multiple of ~16x to Hexagon RemainCo, which represents a small discount to European Industrial peers. Conversely, Octave is valued at ~21x EV/EBIT, which implies a discount to global Engineering Software peers - both multiples reflect upside potential for growth and execution.

For Mensch und Maschine, Q4/25 (publication March 17) will mark the first quarter where the impact of the change in the Autodesk transaction model (~45% of MuM's gross profit) is fully digested, meaning MuM should return to its normal trajectory of robust growth from this point forward. Q4/25 further benefits from the fact that Q4 last year faced significant challenges related to the Autodesk transaction model shift in Sep/24. With a consequently very low comparison base for the Autodesk business, we anticipate excellent y/y growth in Q4/25, making us confident that MuM can achieve the low end of its FY25 guidance range. In fact, while achieving the lower end of its FY25 guidance might appear ambitious, it only requires normal Q4 q/q seasonality for MuM to reach this target - a scenario

business have now been digested. With some market participants expressing skepticism about MuM's ability to achieve the lower end of guidance and the stock trading ~35% below its 10-year median EV/EBIT multiple, we believe a re-rating is likely as MuM resumes robust growth, commencing in Q4/25.

We model 13% y/y growth in Q4 gross profit, primarily driven by the Digitization segment (the Autodesk business), which we expect to be up almost 50% due to the low comparison base for the segment, given that Q4/24 was disrupted by a master data issue requiring manual fixes and binding resources post introduction of the new transaction model (now fully digested). In contrast, we model a more subdued 4% gross profit growth for the Software segment, as a weaker hyperMILL (>60% of the segment) is likely to offset stronger performance from DATAflor and SOFiSTiK. For Q4 EBIT and EPS, we forecast robust y/y growth of ~60% and ~54%, respectively, driven by the Digitization recovery and effective

cost-saving measures. Together, we remain confident that MuM will achieve the low end of its full-year guidance, although with higher conviction in the EBIT and EPS guidance (+9-19% in FY25) and with slightly less conviction for gross profit (+5-7% in FY25). Looking to FY26, we expect MuM to return to its robust growth trajectory. While the upper end of the current mid-term ambition (8-12% gross profit growth, 13-25% EBIT/EPS growth) remains somewhat aggressive in our view, we believe the company can reaccelerate to 9%, 16%, and 16% growth for gross profit, EBIT, and EPS respectively. MuM's current discount to both its historical valuation and Engineering Software peers implies concerns of larger downgrades, which we view as overdone. We maintain our Buy rating with a TP of E60 as we expect a re-rating of shares once MuM resumes its robust growth trajectory in FY26.

Nemetschek is scheduled to report Q4 results on March 19 th in what we anticipate to be a more challenging quarter due to tough comps against the excellent Q4 in Build and Design last year. While Build should maintain robust growth (Bluebeam and GoCanvas), we expect a more challenging quarter for Design as the segment faces tough comps, as Q4 last year benefitted from one-offs from last time Graphisoft license sales and a higher proportion of multi-year subscription contracts. Furthermore, FX headwinds from a weaker $ continue to weigh on reported revenues (~4% headwind), with ~41% of revenues generated in the Americas. Considering these trends, we forecast a slight moderation in growth this quarter, modelling Q4/25 growth of ~11% y/y (~15% cc). We project ~7% growth for Design, reflecting the tough comps from last year's one-time effects (including pull-forward

effects from Graphisoft). Nonetheless, we believe Nemetschek will continue to successfully transition Design customers to subscription-based models, somewhat helped by multi-year subscription contracts, although we note the share of multi-year contracts should be lower than in Q4 last year, also impacting growth. For Build, we project ~19% y/y growth, still underpinned by strong performance from Bluebeam in the US and its successful internationalization. We model 6% growth for Manage, maintaining the positive momentum observed in Q3, with good progress on closing larger deals. Growth in the Media segment remains affected by missing contracts related to the payment/service provider insolvency in Q1. However, we expect Nemetschek to have resolved issues with the new payment provider, leading us to model a return to positive growth of 4% in Q4. Regarding profitability, we anticipate a Q4 EBITDA margin of ~33% (equating to an EBITDA of ~E107m).

While we believe much of the normalized Q4 performance is already reflected in the recent share price performance, we think the tough comps in the next three quarters, stemming from the exceptionally strong Q4/24 and H1/25 (which were partially aided by one-offs), will remain an overhang on investor sentiment for the time being. While acknowledging the success of Nemetschek's phased brand transition and strong underlying performance, we see limited upside given the shares trade at an ~59% premium to the EngSW sector (EV/EBIT NTM), broadly in line with the historic 10-year median premium. We therefore remain on the sidelines with an unchanged target price of E110.

Ocado will be reporting its FY results ending 30 Nov on 26 Feb. It has been a busy end to the 2025 for the group, with the announcement of the recalibration of its relationship with Kroger (please see our note on 09/12/2025 Ocado: Taking stock for more details) and confirmation at the calendar year end of the end of mutual exclusivity with international retail partners in most markets, including the USA with Kroger.

For FY25, our forecasts are in line with the guidance provided for Tech Solutions, Logistics and overall free cash flow/ capex. We assume 10% revenue growth and 25% adj. EBITDA margin for Tech solutions and our c.£30m adj. EBITDA for Logistics is also in line with guidance. Underlying FCF guidance is for an outflow of -£200m, which we are also in line with. We expect total revenues of £1.32bn, adjusted EBITDA of £165.6m and underlying FCF of -£197m. We expect YE net debt, pre-leases of £725m. Ocado spent most of H1'25 refinancing its debt in order to manage its debt maturities in an orderly way, with the bulk of maturities now in 2029/2030. The combination of the refinancing activities and focus on getting to positive cash flow mean the group has sufficient cash to trade through and meet the remaining near-term stubs and maturities. Note the group also has a £300m undrawn

revolving credit facility and will also be receiving the $350m cash recompense from Kroger in Jan 2026, giving more flexibility to the balance sheet. The group is targeting to turn cash flow positive some time in 2026, and being fully cash flow 2027 from 2027. We forecast a small positive underlying cashflow in FY27 which then builds from there. Looking ahead, we believe we took a conservative approach to forecasts, reflecting relatively modest progression from a re-basing in FY26 . The closure of the 3 Kroger sites will impact revenues by c. $50m (c. £38m) in FY26 (these are recurring annual fees). These revenues will be high margin but given its focus on its cash break-even targets, we expect more cost cuts to offset the impact. We assume small negative

revenue growth in Tech Solutions in FY26 or broadly flat if we adjust out the one-off revenue from Morrisons in FY25. We assume slightly higher cost cutting than guided as management's priority will be to meet its cash flow targets as much as possible. Finally, a reminder that Ocado Retail (ORL) is now de-consolidated. There is no change in Ocado's economic interest in ORL. ORL's contribution is reflected as a share in JV profits on the P&L. Note that Ocado has valued its 50% share of Ocado Retail at £750m on the balance sheet.

Investor focus will be on how confidence we can have that the group can win new contracts/customers as exclusivities roll off and as the group deploys new fulfilment products that brings its tech to a wider range of applications. Ocado is re-entering major global grocery markets with its advanced AI-powered and robotic fulfilment solutions, which now encompass store-based automation, in-store and dark store manual fulfilment, and automated Customer Fulfilment Centres of all sizes. The company expects to initiate new commercial activities in multiple international markets and believes it is well-positioned to assist more retailers in capturing market share in the fast-growing online grocery sector. Success in this is key to driving equity value.

PTC is set to publish its Q1/26 results on 04th February, and we expect in-line revenue growth for the quarter as the weakness in Autos continues which could be offset by strong deal wins during the recent quarters. We forecast ARR of ~$2.64b (+8.3% y/y cc) which is within the company's guidance ARR growth range of 7-9% y/y cc (including contribution from the planned divestment of Kepware and ThingWorx) and revenue of $632m in-line with the consensus at $632m. The company has guided revenue in the range of $600-600m including Kepware and ThingWorx. On profitability, we expect in-line operating margins of

40.8%, marginally above consensus at 40.4%. For FY26, PTC guides for revenue of $2,6502,915m and we model revenue of $2,779m at the midpoint of the guidance (vs. cons. at $2,791m). In terms of cash flow generation, PTC guided for FY25 FCF of ~$1,000m. We model FY25 FCF of $993m which is slightly below cons. of $1,000m. We look forward to commentary around end market condition and updates around the planned divestment of the industry connectivity and IoT businesses.

Overall, we remain constructive on the name, given its high proportion of recurring revenues and lot of AI initiatives including launch of new AI capabilities in its existing products as well as a large number of POCs with customers. PTC remains our top pick in Engineering Software, and we keep our target price unchanged at $225, as we value the company based on ~24x CY26E EV/uFCF, broadly in line with key direct peers, reflecting improving execution but remaining challenges in certain end markets.

Sage is set to publish its FQ1/26 trading update on 27 th January, and we believe that growth momentum will remain intact as Sage reported strong FY25 results with underlying ARR in double-digit growth (~11%) for the fourth consecutive year and revenue growth of 10% y/y, underpinned by recurring revenue growth of ~10% y/y. We expect a positive trading update on FQ1 with strong Q4 momentum carrying through into H1/26e, driven by Intacct (esp. in the US) and initial Copilot monetization. Focus will be on ARR where normal seasonality is +2% q/q growth which should at least be achieved off a good Q4 base. On the margin side, cost disciple with operating leverage helped Sage to expanded its underlying operating margin to 150bps, reaching to 23.9%, driving ~15% y/y growth in EPS but we see

some potential moderation of margin expansion this year as growth requires more investments, e.g. around expanding Intacct into further verticals (in the US) or geographically (Europe). Region wise, the US will remain a growing pocket well supported by US Sage Intacct, with ARR growing >20% in Q4, a record volume. We believe Cloud products and initial AI monetization of Copilot will continue to remain as a key catalyst in FY26 growth (DBe: 9.3%), slightly above the company's outlook of ~9%, which we view as conservative. Sage expects operating margins to trend upwards in FY26 and beyond, driven by growth and operating efficiencies (including internal AI adoption in customer support, R&D). Margin expansion is seen rather towards the lower end of the aspired 50-100bps improvement range

per year with FY26 being an investment year again in both product as well as new market entries for future growth, hence we model FY26 margin at 24.8% (up ~85bps). Going into FQ1/26, we model total revenue growth of ~10% y/y cc (org.), reaching GBP670m, slightly ahead of consensus at GBP668m. Recurring revenue growth should remain robust at ~10.5%, thanks to strong momentum in the Cloud business and ARR growth. We have updated our model for FX and slight change in our half-yearly estimates, but kept overall full-year estimates unchanged. We lower our TP to GBp 1,200 (from GBp 1,250) as we now value Sage based on ~25x CY26 P/E and ~22x CY26 EV/uFCF both representing a slight discount to peers to account for Sage's slower growth and/or still lower margins. We use fully adjusted

valuation metrics and Sage's peer group for share-based compensation (treating this as cost in P&L and CF metrics).

We expect a solid Q4 for SAP following a softer Q3 which was adversely impacted mostly by uncertainties around the trade environment following Liberation Day. We see SAP's deal pipeline normalizing and some contracts that have been pushed out to 2026 have returned to Q4, in our view. Still, with Q4 usually being relatively backend loaded around the weeks running up to Christmas, there remains some potential volatility especially given a pipeline with several larger deals in it this quarter, in our view. We see current Cloud backlog (CCB) growth for Q4 at 25-26% while expecting a continued strong evolution of total Cloud backlog (TCB capturing SAP's longer-term pipeline with an average duration of ~5 years) at

>30% as the company continues to build long-term revenue growth visibility on the back of multi-year Cloud migrations, new customer acquisitions, especially in the midmarket, and AI projects. Beyond CCB and TCB, we believe the market focus to be mostly on SAP's 2026 guidance where we expect ~11% group cc revenue growth, ~24.5% Cloud cc revenue growth, ~E11.8b operating profit (29.5% margin) and E9.4b FCF, broadly in-line to slightly above consensus. In terms of messaging, we expect management to point to a continued gradual moderation of CCB growth in percentage terms (similar as when entering FY25) but a sustained acceleration of group growth into FY27e (DBe 12.5% from ~10% in FY25e). While Software may continue to be volatile as a sector, we see the weakness in SAP of the last months as a buying opportunity with scope for the demand environment to somewhat improve into Q4 and FY26 and the stock remains a top pick in European Tech as well as global

Software. We keep our estimates unchanged and reiterating our price target at E270, valuing SAP at ~34x CY26E EV/uFCF, a slight premium to peers, accounting for share gains in Cloud, combined with faster earnings and FCF growth.

Although SAP has changed the disclosure of its Cloud revenue growth breakdown with Q1/24 (which we view as sensible, given increased sales of solution bundles rather than individual applications), below, we provide an update on our analysis of S/4HANA Cloud growth vs. Cloud ERP at peers, assuming a continued increase in the share of S/4HANA Cloud within Cloud ERP Suite, in-line with trends over the last few quarters. This points to S/4HANA Cloud growth in the ~40% range in Q3/25 as well, which remains impressive vs. peers' Cloud ERP growth of ~20% (Figure 7). In Figure 6, we compare the Cloud ERP ramp-up and growth trajectory post the launch of SAP's S/4HANA Cloud ERP with major industry peers (using Deutsche Bank estimates and Bloomberg Intelligence data if Cloud ERP is not reported) on an indexed basis, starting with the first quarter for each company in which quarterly Cloud ERP revenues surpassed $100m.

This chart shows that SAP has been off to a very strong start, and it continues to see an impressive pace of Cloud ERP business expansion. While this is clearly helped by its large installed on-premise customer base and the fact that the Cloud ERP market is now much more mature, we still find this picture to be quite encouraging. We continue to hear feedback from bears on the stock that S/4HANA Cloud growth needs to moderate toward current peer growth levels (i.e., low-twenties to highteens percentage, as shown below). Yet, based on our industry and customer conversations, we believe that this will stay in the 30%+ range in 2026 and likely still meaningfully above 20% for the coming years, as customers have embarked (and continue to do so) on multi-year transformation deals with SAP that continue to grow in scope (and hence revenue) over time.

We see current Cloud backlog (CCB) growth for Q4 at 25-26% while expecting a continued strong evolution of total Cloud backlog (TCB - capturing SAP's longerterm pipeline with an average duration of ~5 years) at >30% as the company continues to build long-term revenue growth visibility on the back of multi-year Cloud migrations, new customer acquisitions, especially in the mid-market, and AI projects. The strong booking momentum should drive continued 30%+ growth for its

Cloud ERP Suite, which accelerated to ~31% y/y cc in Q3/25, despite headwinds from weaker transactional revenues. We model Q4 Cloud revenue growth toward ~26% y/y (vs ~26.5% in Q3), reaching E5,564 m, in-line with consensus estimates, thanks to strong deal pipeline. helped by accelerated adoption of Business Data Cloud and AI solutions. We expect a ~40bps y/y decline in overall gross margin, mostly on the back of lower contribution from high margin Licensing business, partly offset by improving Cloud gross margins (~170bps y/y). We model non-IFRS operating margin at 28.2% (vs. ~28.3% in Q3/25) with some headwind from restructuring costs (~E100m) being booked into OpEx in Q4 (this will be an ongoing expense every year going forward).

We expect total Q4/25 revenue of ~E9.6b (~7% y/y cc), roughly in-line with cons. at ~E9.7b (Visible Alpha, as published by SAP), driven by continued growth in Cloud, but with headwinds in transactional and overall partially offset by weaker licensing. We see Cloud and Software revenue at ~E8.6b (vs. cons. of ~E8.6b), with ~11% y/y cc growth. Within Cloud and Software, we expect Cloud revenue momentum to remain strong at ~26.0% y/y cc (vs. ~26.5% in Q3/25) and reach ~E5.6b, roughly in-line with cons, while seeing continued good momentum into Q1/26 and Q2/26, but slightly lower than Q4/25. This should be driven by strong Cloud backlog thanks to ongoing ERP Cloud conversions at customers, new wins backed by AI driven competitive product portfolios and improving underlying growth in Cloud outside of ERP. We expect continued strong CCB momentum in FY26e, still at or above

midtwenties percentage levels and beyond. Within the Cloud and Software segment, we expect Licensing revenues to have a weaker quarter, as we are expecting a slightly higher decline of 41% y/y cc with revenue touching E397m, slightly lower than consensus of E454m. We expect Support revenue growth to moderately decelerate by ~6% y/y cc, reaching ~E2.65b (above cons. at ~E2.57b). For the Services segment, we see a modest decline reaching revenues of E987m in Q4/25.

Cloud and Software gross margins should come in at ~80%, slightly down by ~75bps y/y, primarily due to lower contribution from Licensing, but offset by expanding Cloud margins. We believe that Cloud gross margins should continue to improve by ~170bps y/y, reaching 75.2%. We estimate the Services segment's gross margin to be 18.5% (down ~600bps y/y) for Q4/25, leading to an overall gross margin of ~74% (down by ~40bps y/y). On the operating margin side (including SBC expenses, as per new reporting), we expect stable operating margin, reaching to 28.2% (vs. 28.3% in Q3/25), driving non-IFRS operating profit toward ~E2.70b, (vs. cons at ~E2.73b) with softer Licensing in the quarter as well as restructuring costs headwinds.

For 2025, we model revenue of ~E36.7b (~10% y/y cc), slightly below cons. at ~E36.8b, driven by continued growth in Cloud. Cloud is expected to grow at ~26.4% y/y cc, in-line with the lower end of SAP's target range of 26-28% y/y cc. We expect non-IFRS operating profit to expand by ~420bps y/y, reaching ~E10.3b (or a margin of 28.0%), roughly in-line with cons. at ~E10.33b (or 28.0%) and the lower end of company's guidance of E10.3-10.6b at cc. We believe that margin expansion will be

largely attributed to incremental savings from the extended transformation program. Coupled with efficiency gains (also outside the transformation program, e.g., in Cloud GMs, GTM/sales, internal use of AI tools, etc.), we believe SAP is on a trajectory for sustained top- and bottom-line growth acceleration well beyond 2025. For FY26, we are expecting continued top-line growth of ~11% y/y cc with sales reaching E40.1b (vs. cons at ~E40.6b), well supported by continued momentum in Cloud business growth of 24.5% touching ~E25.5b, just slightly below consensus of E25.8b. On the margin front, we are expecting non-IFRS operating margin expansion of ~150bps y/y, reaching to 29.5%, above consensus estimates of 29.2% and we also see scope for some positive surprise on FCF (cons E9.3b, DBe E9.4b).

We reiterate our target price of E270, based on ~34x EV/uFCF, a slight premium to peers, accounting for share gains and faster earnings and FCF growth. This results in our price target, while our bull case analysis (faster Cloud migration of installed base, better underlying growth in the coming years) points to a potential valuation of E400 in the medium term. Assuming that SAP can keep a multiple in the midthirties (EV/uFCF), the strong FCF expansion over the coming years, with scope for upside to our base, should warrant such upside potential, in our view.

TeamViewer has already pre-released their FY25 numbers, however the full set of earnings is expected to be printed on the 10th of February along with FY26 guidance. In the pre-release TeamViewer announced Revenue for FY25 to have increased by 5% cc and ARR by 2% in cc, with continued momentum in Enterprise, whereas the margin guidance of 'around 44%' to have remained unchanged. The poor performance in ARR was driven by negative FX changes between EURUSD, and this puts TeamViewer's PF FY performance on the low-end of their guidance. Although we welcome positive commentary on continued momentum in Enterprise, we suspect 1E's performance will continue to weigh on the fundamentals in 2026, particularly on SMB. We update our model to reflect the prerelease but remain on the sidelines as the fear of a tougher enterprise software landscape particularly in remote connectivity, management and workplace experience are likely to linger in 2026. Hold.

Temenos reported their FY25 pre-release with PF revenue growing 10% in cc. to $1.071bn, PF Subscription and SaaS growth of 9% in cc to $452m, PF EBIT margin of 34.7% and PF FCF growth of 15% to $257m. They expect to publish their full year results on the 24th of February where they will be guiding to 2026. Now, we see this year end as a strong one where in this current enterprise software environment a 10% grower with 15% FCF growth and expanding margins should warrant a premium. That said, even though we are marginally more positive on the name, we still need to see where 2026 guide will land and how lumpy the pipeline will be in the coming quarters. We acknowledge the strong end to the year and welcome management commentary on the sales environment being stable, which cannot be said the same for the rest of the enterprise software market, with a good number of new logos signed in the quarter. We update our numbers with those provided by

the pre-release and roughly leave our 2026 numbers unchanged, but raise our TP from CHF 70 to 77 to account for the recent share price rally driven by better sentiment in the name. Our target price is based on a simple average of: 1) ~19x our FY27 EPS estimate, and 2) ~18x EV/uFCF on our estimated FY27 uFCF, both roughly in-line with their peers. We have rolled forward valuation by a year and our target multiples are no longer at a discount to peers. Hold.

Bechtle is the market leader in a sector that should continue to show mid- to highsingle-digit %age growth rates medium-term. Clearly, the Status Quo is unsatisfying but during the last two decades, the company has only reported two years with negative revenue growth (during the GFC in 2009 and the Corona pandemic in 2020), it was never loss-making on the EBT level, and can report sales/ EBT CAGRs of 12% and 18%, respectively. Bechtle is due to report its FY25 results on 20 March but we normally already get some preliminary key figures during the first week of February each year. In the Q3/25 results press release CEO Olemotz stated that 'looking at the individual quarters of the 2025 financial year, a clear upward trajectory emerges. We have overcome the most difficult period and are firmly back on the path to growth.' While the FY25 business volume (0-5% higher YoY / 9M25: +5% YoY) and revenue (+/- 3% YoY /

9M25: +1%) guidance were already largely on track back then, achieving the lower end of the +/-5% FY25E EBT guidance required significant improvement in EBT growth momentum in Q4/25E (+24% YoY needed). However, Q4/24 had a clean basis (no one-off boosts), and we're seeing renewed public sector ordering from existing contracts. Furthermore, increasing sales volumes should drive back-end margin improvements. Having said this, we expect FY25E business volume (+5% yoy) and revenue (+2% yoy) to be up yoy but EBT (-5% yoy) to decline yoy.

We equally-weight two valuation approaches. Our fundamental valuation is derived from our standard three-stage DCF model, using a WACC of 5.4%, based on a risk-free interest rate of 2.7%, risk premium of 6%, beta of 0.9, and 55% equity ratio; yielding a valuation of EUR 53. Our relative, multiples-based valuation is the median of Bechtle's 10-year P/E, EV/EBIT, EV/EBITDA and EV/ Sales applied to our FY26 estimates; yielding a per-share value of EUR 44. Equally weighted, our target price is EUR 49. We maintain our Buy rating. On our numbers, the shares trade at a 10.0x EV/EBITDA 2026, within the valuation band (+/- 1 standard deviation) of ~814x over the last 10 years (~9-14x for the last five years).

CANCOM is Germany's seventh-largest independent IT Service company, reporting its preliminary FY25 results on 12 February. FY25 was characterized by public sector demand being dampened and the recovery in SME demand only starting to show first signs of life again very recently. In parallel, CANCOM is rightsizing its organization, while high competitive pressure is unchanged. CANCOM guides for a FY25 revenue decline of 2% yoy (DBe -2% yoy), while EBITDA should be 7% yoy lower (DBe -7% yoy) (both at midpoint). According to CEO Rath, CANCOM is 'seeing increasing signs of stabilisation and recovery in the further course of the year" and the company looks "forward to the last quarter of the year with confidence and expect to successfully conclude the 2025 financial year in line with our forecast." Looking ahead, we believe that FY26E has the potential to see both rising public sector activity as well as SME demand recovering and

we envisage revenue to increase 6% yoy, while EBITDA could rise by 23% yoy (EBITDA margin 6.9%, +95bps yoy). CANCOM is also participating in several larger tenders with the public sector currently, so momentum is picking up further. Additionally, CFO Stark stated that he expects to see first benefits from the recently implemented efficiency measures already in the running quarter, with the full effect then becoming visible next year. CANCOM should also significantly benefit from the stimulus package the German government is currently working on, as business with the public sector accounts for ~35% of revenue. However, it will likely take until H2/26 at the earliest for CANCOM to see any benefit. We use two equally-weighted valuation approaches: our standard three-stage DCF model and an IT service peer group comparison. We reiterate our Buy rating and price target of EUR 31.

Capgemini is set to report Q4 and H2/25 on 13th of Feb. Our recent industry conversations as well as Accenture commentary suggest a somewhat stable environment q/q in lack of discretionary spending. We expect Capgemini to report E5.77bn in revenues for Q4/25 (vs cons E5.80bn), growing organically 1.9% y/y. Given the limited organic growth, we expect margins to remain broadly stable at 14.2% in H2/25. We believe progress in Gen-Al bookings will remain steady but gradual, as most corporates need to upgrade their IT systems before becoming Already. This dynamic could, however, generate a strong pipeline of

multi-year projects for Capgemini, primarily within its legacy client base. That said, we expect Capgemini to update the market on the integration and performance of WNS, with further clarity on how Capgemini's Al capabilities complement WNS's offering and support the ramp-up in Gen-Al-related bookings and pipeline development. We expect a strong performance from WNS, supported by the ISG Index, which showed 13% y/y growth in BPO ACV in Q4/25-the strongest quarter since Q1/24. Moreover, overall IT budgets (in managed services) for 2026 are expected to be largely flat, with Al accounting for the largest area of incremental spend as pilot projects increasingly move into production, according to the ISG Index.

Our channel checks and third-party data indicate that approximately 50% of corporates plan to increase their IT budgets in FY26. However, budgets are typically finalized toward the end of February, limiting visibility on FY26 guidance at this stage. We therefore expect management to remain conservative in its 2026 outlook, assuming a continuation of current trends and a stable macroeconomic environment. We model 3.5% organic growth for FY26, with margins of 14.1%, supported by the contribution from the WNS acquisition. Capgemini is currently trading at 10.6x P/E versus Accenture at 16.9x (peer average 16.5x). We believe the market has not yet attributed meaningful value to the WNS acquisition, nor to the potential monetization opportunity arising from large-scale IT infrastructure modernization among legacy clients as Al and Gen-Al capabilities become increasingly mainstream. We maintain our Buy with our TP unchanged at E170.

Netcompany is due to report their FY25 earnings on the 3rd of February in what we anticipate to be a softer end to the year driven by an elongation of sales cycles and a delay in spending decisions in the public space, particularly in Denmark as elections in Q4 have likely caused a pause on any large transformational projects budget approval. In the UK, we don't see any material development on the DALAS project to have benefited them in Q4 and likely neither in Q1. That is as HMRC is running on old legacy systems that require specialized FTEs and contractors to

migrate and modernize. We see current utilization rates as low as 20-30% and thus don't expect any major change in the near-term that would yield to material revenue uplift. That said, on the margin front we expect a better performance in 2026 as they have spent quite a fair amount of FTEs (c. 100) on product and business development that were not directly billing. This means that for the quarter we will likely still see some pressure on margins, with a performance similar to that of Q3, but that should improve into 2026. Although there are 2 more working days in Q4 y/y, they are in Belgium and Luxemburg so we don't expect material uplift from that, which typically is the case if there are 3-4 more days in Denmark, for example. All in all, we remain cautious in the near term on the exposure that NETC holds on the ITS public and private sector as we see challenges from both a geopolitical and a decline in industry spend standpoint. Hold.

Reply will report Q4/25 results on 12 March. We are looking for organic ccy growth of 5.3%/ reported growth 4.7% to €665 in Q4, to bring total revenue for the FY to €2,485 (+5.7% organic ccy/+7.8% reported) - in line with consensus. Q4 is typically Reply's seasonally strongest quarter, in terms of revenue and margin. We forecast a Q4 adj EBITDA margin of 21.0% (-60bp) to bring the full year margin of 19.1% (+1.3ppt YoY) - this is slightly ahead of Q4 consensus margin at 20.6%. While commentary remained cautious at Q3 into Q4 we believe our Q4 margin forecast looks highly achievable, given a strong margin performance YTD (Q1-Q3: +1.6ppt/ +2.7ppt/+1.5ppt YoY), partially driven by internal realisation of automation/AI-led efficiencies, and the fact that Q4/24 included c.€32m of non-recurring expense.

We expect Region 1 (inc Italy) to sustain strong organic growth, forecasting +8.2% LFL growth (Q3: +7.9%) to €441.2m, and continued underlying improvement in Region 3 (UK, France, Benelux) driven by the UK business to +4.5% LFL/€483.9m (Q1-Q3: -1.6%/ +2.6%/+4.1.%). Region 2 (inc Germany) has been impacted in recent periods by higher exposure to weaker end markets (e.g. Automotive, Media) and a higher proportion of revenue through agency businesses (+12.6%, +10.8%, +6.2%, +3.0%, +1.4%, -1.6% LFL growth through Q2/24-Q3). While work is ongoing to reposition the business which could drive improvement into FY26, we retain a more cautious view on the growth outlook in Q4 forecasting a further -1.5% decline.

Reply shares fell -25% through 2024, with slower organic growth (as impacted by tariff disruption to business confidence and IT services budgets) coinciding with heightened debate on the impact of generative and Agentic AI on IT services business models. In our view, Reply is well placed to capitalise on the opportunity to help customers further their AI agendas and aid enterprises in their journey towards a new architectural mindset, bringing data closer to agents, enabling intelligent orchestration and ensuring security and integrity in autonomous processes. In the last quarter, management highlighted good adoption in Banking, Energy & utilities and traction for Reply's pre-built apps, with AI starting to move to scale in some cases. Nonetheless, we believe a recovery in IT discretionary spend remains the key determinant of near-term organic growth. Our BUY rating and €170 target price are unchanged, underpinned by a 13x CY26E EV/EBITDA

target multiple - in line with other high-quality peers in the IT services sector. Reply currently trades at c. 8x CY26 EV/EBITDA.

SoftwareOne is expected to report on 31st of Mar when we expect the company to report 3% cc y/y lfl revenue growth to CHF343m in Q4/25. FX headwinds are

expected to have an overall impact of ~2.5-3pp, in line with the first 9M. According to the company, revenue momentum should benefit from continued CSP adoption as customers transition from EA agreements, even partially offsetting prior impacts from Microsoft incentive changes. While go-to-market initiatives implemented in 2024/25 are expected to support performance, it is difficult to assess whether there has been any material turnaround in North America, given the current reporting structure and the absence of a standalone SoftwareOne view for the region. Moreover, Revenue synergies from cross-selling and combined customer initiatives are likely limited in Q4, with more material impact anticipated in 2026. Our channel checks indicate there was no December budget flush, which typically has a meaningful impact on guidance; if such a flush had been expected to support the communicated flat guidance, this absence introduces downside risk. APAC is likely to remain a bright spot, driven by strong performances in Australia and India and improving channel business, while DOC may continue to face

moderate pressure. LFL EBITDA margin is expected to remain above 20%, supported by disciplined cost control and partial realisation of integration and cost synergies. Currently we are modeling 20.7% for Q4/25 resulting in FY25 margin at 20.1% (Guidance> 20% on lfl basis). Looking ahead to FY26, we are modeling 6.4% y/y lfl revenue growth, though this is highly contingent on execution by management across multiple fronts, including the go-to-market initiatives, the potential turnaround in North America, the continued transition from EA to CSP, and the overall integration process. Given the history of misexecution over the past couple of years, the market is seeking further evidence that initiatives are on track, and pro forma disclosures would greatly improve visibility and support more detailed modeling. For now, we maintain a cautious stance, reflecting these execution risks, and retain Hold.

Amadeus remains the strongest of the major GDS players, and dominant in the travel technology industry. However, the rise of NDC and direct contact poses a risk to the company's largest division. Other uncertainties, e.g., airline capacity constraints, geopolitical conflicts, etc, also put pressure on the stock. We believe Amadeus needs to continue investing in its technology to remain a top player. Currently, we do not regard the risk/reward profile justified. HOLD.

Our target price is based on a simple average of the following valuation methodologies: 1) an ~18.3x 2026E PE and 2) a ~21.1x 2026E EV/uFCF. Both multiples are at a discount to the peer averages to account for perceived short and medium-term risks to bookings on the back of macro uncertainty which could impact global air traffic, decline in US consumer sentiment and further industry risks related to supply chain.

n A stronger-than-expected recovery in global travel industry n Competitive share gains n Stronger-than-expected cost base adjustments

n A slower-than-expected recovery in global travel industry n Business travel budget cuts may be more severe than we expect n Pricing cuts on the company's GDS and IT Solutions. n Further delays in payments division n Losing more market share to direct connect or other NDC providers.

ATOSS is a leader in the German-speaking workforce management (WFM) market, offering software for optimized personnel deployment, focusing on industries such as manufacturing, retail and healthcare. The company's advanced solutions help ensure that clients have the right number of employees, with the right skills available, at the right place, time and cost. ATOSS is a high-quality business, with visibility for consistent growth in the mid-teens, industry-leading profitability and healthy cash conversion. We believe the 2025 investment year for ATOSS should offer a good buying opportunity into a high-quality name with reaccelerating margins and high-teens EPS growth from '26 onwards on the back of a successful European expansion. Buy.

We value ATOSS based on a 50/50 blend of a peer-based valuation and DCF, to reflect ATOSS's relatively predictable growth and stable cash flows over the long term. For relative valuation, we value ATOSS in line with the average FY25E EV/uFCF multiple of ATOSS's peer group (versus a 20% premium, on average, over the last four years and to reflect the 2025 investment year). Stronger performance, clean financials and a healthy balance sheet together with higher cash returns and an overall better growth outlook over the long term should warrant a rerating in ATOSS's multiple in the longer term. For our DCF, we assume a WACC of 9.4%, derived from a risk-free rate of 2.5%, a risk premium of 6% and beta of ~1.2 (broadly in line with BBG historical beta). We also assume a cash tax rate of 32% and a terminal growth rate of 2.0%.

Key downside risks to our view include, but are not limited to: 1) slower-thanexpected European expansion; 2) a worsening macro environment impacting software spend (especially in DACH); 3) issues associated with the cloud migration (e.g., higher churn, slower progress, etc.); 4) potentially value-destructive M&A; 5) the prospect of further placing by major shareholders creating an overhang on the share price; 6) growing exposure to SMEs (higher churn, higher sensitivity to economic development, etc.); 7) adverse changes in regulation (labor laws, etc.); 8) failure to launch new products/technology; and 9) increased competition.

AutoStore operates in the warehouse automation space which has a lot of structural drivers given businesses need to drive efficiency, save costs, improve accuracy and meeting increasing demands from customers. AutoStore has pioneered and is the market leader in robotic, cube-based AS/RS (automated storage and retrieval system), which has seen strong adoption due to its flexibility, performance and ROI. Performance in the last 12-18 months has been impacted by a weaker macro economic backdrop, exacerbated by tariff-related uncertainties. Part of its business model is also shifting from a capex-style purchase to "as-aservice" where revenues are recognised over a much longer time period. As such, revenues and earnings have been volatile in Q1/Q2 and visibility remains poor. Medium-term, the group has a proven record of landing and expanding with customers and with 70-80% of warehouses globally still relying heavily on manual processes, there is a strong medium-term growth opportunity.

Our target price is based on a DCF using a 9.2% WACC (6.5% cost of debt, 10% cost of equity), LT EBIT margins of 35%, medium-term growth rate of 12.5% and terminal growth of 3%. There is considerable uncertainty in the macro environment and the model is also undergoing a shift so there is risk to these assumptions.

Risks include: 1) end customers propensity to buy multi-million dollar systems will be impacted by macroeconomic conditions ; 2) systems are predominantly a capex purchase and can result in a lumpy revenue profile; 3) some deals are now moving more to an as-a-service model - where revenue recognition is over a much longer period of time potentially creating revenue gaps near term; 4) there are competing warehouse automation technologies and there is no guarantee the group's type of system will continue to win share; 5) the group works with distribution partners to get their product to market - loss of a key partner could impact revenue materially; 6) the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the group (aluminum is the key material in the group's system) is still hard to measure - NA sales is c.25% of total); 7) any disruption in its supply chain/ production facilities (Poland and Thailand) could impact customers and revenues; 8) there is also currency risk with most revenues in EUR and USD and most costs in NOK, PLN and EUR. On the upside, the main risk is an improvement in the macro backdrop that is better and faster than we

anticipate in our forecasts. There is also a possible improvement in its win-rate either through better sales execution, a more appealing model or a combination of both.

In the Q3/25 results press release CEO Olemotz stated that ' looking at the individual quarters of the 2025 financial year, a clear upward trajectory emerges. We have overcome the most difficult period and are firmly back on the path to growth.' While the FY25 business volume (0-5% higher yoy / 9M25: +5% yoy) and revenue (+/- 3% yoy / 9M25: +1%) guidance have been well in reach already back then, it needed further, significant improving EBT growth momentum in Q4/25E (+24% yoy needed in Q4/25E) to reach the lower end of the +/-5% FY25E EBT guidance. However, the Q4/24 basis was clean (no more provisions released, no more supplier discounts/rebates included, etc.) and especially the public sector seems to have started ordering from its existing framework contracts

again. Additionally, in line with increasing volumes sold, the back-end margin should improve again. Prior to last year's two profit warnings, the first since FY09, Bechtle had a track record of guiding conservatively and we envisage the company striving to revert to this policy. Having said this, we expect FY25E business volume (+5% yoy) and revenue (+2% yoy) to be up yoy but EBT (-5% yoy) to decline yoy. Bechtle should significantly benefit from the German stimulus package. While we view it highly likely that this will happen, not least because business with the public sector accounts for ~40% of group revenue, we think that it will take until the end of FY26 at the earliest to see Bechtle benefiting and the currently improving public sector performance is solely based on existing framework agreements, i.e. not benefitting from fresh public spending at all.

Bechtle's business model depends heavily on the IT spending behaviour of corporates and government agencies, especially in the German market. Hence, any unexpected pullback would constitute the biggest risk to our investment case. More specific to Bechtle, problems in the international roll-out of the group's ecommerce activities would be the biggest downside risk.

CANCOM guides for FY25 revenue of EUR 1,650-1,750m (-2% yoy at midpoint / DBe -2% yoy). EBITDA should reach EUR 100-110m (-7% yoy at midpoint / DBe -7% yoy), while EBITA is expected to reach EUR 46-56m (-14% yoy at midpoint / DBe -12% yoy). The full-year guidance is very back-end loaded, though, with the 9M25 EBITDA so far only accounting for 61% for CANCOM's FY25 guidance at the midpoint (64% at the lower end). However, given the nature of CANCOM's business, the second half of a business year, and especially the fourth quarter, in general is stronger than the first half. Q4/25E EBITDA now needs to reach EUR >36m (Q4/24: EUR 27m), in order to reach the low end of the FY25 guidance. When asked about how this can/will be achieved, management stressed that the public sector in Germany is improving again, whereas we saw a standstill in Germany in Q4/24 due to

upcoming snap elections. Additionally, Q4/24 was negatively impacted by one-offs of EUR ~6m (EUR 4m risk provisions + EUR 2m severance packages), hence provides a lower basis now. CEO Rath explicitly confirmed his optimism on the Q3/25 call that the FY25 guidance is reachable, as he not only sees the public sector coming back again (which was not the case in Q4/24) but also as first SMEs start with their upgrades from Windows10 to Windows11 (something that was postponed by many customers for the last 4-6 quarters). However, CANCOM envisages it will only reach the lower end of the guidance up to the midpoint, a view that we reflect in our estimates.

For FY26E we envisage revenue to increase 6% yoy and EBITDA to rise by 23% yoy (EBITDA margin 6.9%, +95bps yoy) . CANCOM is also participating in several larger tenders with the public sector currently, so momentum is picking up further. Additionally, CFO Stark stated that he expects to see first benefits from the recently implemented efficiency measures already in the running quarter, with the full effect then becoming visible next year. Medium term, we believe that the underlying trend of rising digitisation in the enterprise and public sectors is unbroken. CANCOM should also significantly benefit from the stimulus package the German government is currently working on, as business with the public sector accounts for ~35% of revenue. However, it will likely take until H2/26 at the earliest for CANCOM to see any benefit.

We use two equally-weighted valuation approaches: our standard three-stage DCF model and an IT service peer group comparison. Our DCF model uses WACC of 6.6%, based on a risk-free interest rate of 2.8%, a risk premium of 6%, beta of 0.7 and an 85% equity ratio, plus a TGR of 2.0%. This leads to an estimated value of EUR 35 per share. Our multiples-based valuation is the average of the median peer multiples for 2026E EV/EBIT, EV/EBITDA and EV/sales applied to our estimates for CANCOM. This leads to an estimated value of EUR 27 per share. We reiterate our Buy rating and keep our price target of EUR 31.

Based on our FY26 forecasts, CANCOM currently trades at a ~30% discount to its peer group's EV/EBIT multiple and at a ~50% discount if we compare EV/EBITDA multiples (the discrepancy is mainly due to PPA after the KBC acquisition). Much of this is due to a number of negative surprises over the last few quarters, including the latest one (profit warning) at the end of July 2025.

CANCOM derives the bulk of its revenue from Germany. Given that the IT market is largely correlated with general economic conditions, a macro slowdown could lead to cuts in IT spending. Another major downside risk is the potential entrance of a large IT vendor into the SME market.

Capgemini offers information technology services in several verticals including aerospace, automotive, life science, and telecom worldwide. With the addition of Altran, the company became the leader in ER&D services in 2020 and one of the few among its peers with both an IT and OT proposition. The company has deemphasized its exposure to on-prem and expanded its Digital and Cloud services to +65% of total revenues in 2020, way above most of its peers. Capgemini also deployed new measures for its workforce that are expected to expand its margins on the back of improvements in utilization rate. Our Buy rating is based on the recent derating, large valuation discount to best-in-class peer, and Cap's prime position in capitalizing the demand once the recovery started.

We value Capgemini on a 50/50 blend of ~12.8x '26e PF P/E and 15.6x '26 PF EV/ uFCF, broadly in line with peers. This reflects recent improvements in previously challenged geographies and sectors, while acknowledging ongoing market uncertainty and low visibility.

Risks include competitive share losses, especially the loss of large outsourcing contracts, and a macroeconomic and IT spending downturn. CAP may be less successful than we expect in renewing its services portfolio, resulting in slower growth and margin pressure. FX headwinds may be more extreme than we expect, impacting growth and margins.

Dassault has a market-leading product offering and exhibits strong execution. In our view, the incremental upside from a fundamental standpoint is partly priced in, particularly with regard to 3DX penetration and a subscription shift in Solidworks, but also acknowledging a prospective Life Sciences growth slowdown. While Dassault is a leader in terms of performance and functionality in many respects, especially with its 3DXPERIENCE offering, we believe it will need to accelerate its Cloud strategy, get Industrial Innovation back to a double-digit growth rate and achieve a healthier conversion of Medidata customers to regain its appeal to investors. We rate the stock a Hold.

We value Dassault on a 50/50 blend of FY26E P/E and EV/uFCF of c. 20x and 22x, discounts to its peers and its five-year averages, to reflect short-term guidance risks and the risks around the Life Sciences business.

Upside risks include: 1) another large deal in automotive could surprise markets and provide a positive skew to total revenue for the year; 2) a faster rebound in clinical trial starts could mean more adoption of Medidata renewals; and 3) faster acceleration in subscription and 3DX penetration could offset weaker Life Sciences growth. Downside risks include: 1) global capex and R&D in important end markets that are weaker than we expect; 2) aggressive competitors gain share; 3) slowing penetration in 3DX, with the company unable to achieve the targeted increase in TCV; 4) Life Sciences decelerating due to a continued downward trend in clinical trial studies; and 5) CAD and PLM markets weakening on slower IT spending

We have a broadly positive view of Hexagon's strategy and product set while we see new management off to a good start, taking the right actions to return the business back to better growth. However, given a challenging macro backdrop and slow development in some of Hexagon's key end markets, we see cyclical headwinds persisting for now, impairing growth potential. A proposed break-up into two companies could unlock hidden value but would also require operational improvements at both companies but especially Octave. We view the business as fairly valued here and rate Hexagon Hold.

We value Hexagon using a SOTP valuation after the company's proposed split into the Octave NewCo (mostly former ALI) and Hexagon RemainCo as well as the recent Design & Engineering asset sale deal to a leading US EDA player for E2.7b. We apply a FY26e EV/EBIT multiple of ~17x to Hexagon RemainCo, which represents a small discount to European Industrial peers. Conversely, Octave is valued at ~21x EV/EBIT, which implies a discount to global Engineering Software peers due to its currently subdued growth profile.

Key upside risks include: 1) more pronounced recovery in key end markets, i.e., Manufacturing & Construction or Geosytems in China; 2) greater-than-expected revenue & cost synergies from acquisitions; and 3) successful new product launches; 4) a takeover of Octave at an attractive premium (ahead of the anticipated spin-off). Downside risks include: 1) competitive share losses; 2) slower-thanexpected recovery in Manufacturing and Construction and a sustained downturn in Geosystems; and 3) Hexagon may experience less margin benefit from the introduction of new products than we expect.

Mensch und Maschine (MuM) is a leading European Autodesk partner providing software and digitization services for the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) and manufacturing industries. A change in the accounting treatment of its Autodesk business as a result of the shift in Autodesk's go-tomarket motion temporarily distorts MuM's FY25 financials, we believe masking the underlying strength of the company. We see this transition year as an attractive entry point, with MuM trading at a significant discount to its 10-year EV/EBIT multiple. We believe shares can re-rate to historical valuation levels once MuM resumes its normal trajectory of robust EPS growth in '26/'27, driven by reaccelerating growth and margin expansion.

MuM combines a Software segment that can be compared to engineering software companies, while the Autodesk business exhibits characteristics of IT services and consulting. We, hence, use a SOTP approach when valuing MuM, as we believe the Autodesk VAR business should be valued differently from its fastergrowing,

highermargin Software business. We value the Software segment at ~22x EV/EBIT, at a 30% discount to the median of comparable engineering software companies. This discount reflects a slightly less dominant market position and the smaller TAM of MuM´s software brands, as well as a discount, given our estimates being slightly below consensus. The Digitization segment is valued at ~11x EV/EBIT, the median of a broad group of IT services and VAR peers. We adjust for minorities (with SOFiSTiK and DATAflor being fully consolidated in the Software segment), valued at ~20x P/E, a 30% discount to the median P/E of our engineering software peer group. Combined, we derive our target price. Hence, although our estimates for outer years are slightly below consensus, we view valuation levels as compelling and come to the conclusion of a Buy rating.

Key downside risks to our view include, but are not limited to: 1) MuM's dependence on Autodesk, 2) risks associated with changes in Autodesk's pricing model, 3) intensified competition and consolidation trends in the Autodesk partner channel, 4) MuM's exposure to cyclical end markets, 5) risks associated with innovation and technological advancements, 6) potentially value-destructive M&A activity in the future, and 7) risks associated with MuM's shareholder structure.

We believe that Nemetschek is well positioned as one of the leading suppliers of BIM software, outperforming the global AEC market with its strong multi-brand suite of products, including Bluebeam, Allplan, Graphisoft and Vectorworks. The company is the only player addressing each specific AEC niche market from the design of a building to its management - thus offering a gapless value chain and the ability to foster strong and diversified future growth. In addition, we expect inorganic effects from frequent earnings-accretive acquisitions in the global BIM stage. As Nemetschek stands out versus peers, we view a premium as justified. However, much of the potential appears to be priced in. Hence, we rate the stock Hold.

We value Nemetschek using a 50/50 blend of: 1) a ~42x FY26E P/E, and 2) a ~36x FY26E EV/uFCF. These valuation approaches represent ~50% / ~33% premiums to peer group average multiples, in line with the median premium Nemetschek traded at over the last 10 years. We view this as justified given its strong and consistent growth potential in the long term, strong margin expansion potential, as well as top management and agile company structure.

Key up/downside risks include: 1) stronger/weakening macroeconomic conditions in the AEC/O industry, which could affect demand; 2) launch of new products and new technology; 3) better/worse acquisition integration, 4) risks associated with the transition of customers to subscription-based pricing models (churn, faster/slower progress), 5) upside/downside risks associated with Nemetschek's internationalization and expansion into foreign markets (most notably India), and 6) adverse/favorable development in BIM regulation.

Netcompany is a digitally-focused IT Services business with a strong growth track record. We see Netcompany expanding into adjacent Northern European markets with a focus on multiyear public sector digital projects. We view the company's hiring strategy as a differentiator. While we are optimistic on its prospects and management, we see Netcompany as a more defensive name in the sector, less geared to a pending post-Covid recovery. Hold.

Our TP is based on an average of an ~18x FY26E P/E and an ~19x FY26E EV/uFCF, higher than traditional IT Services peers but lower than high-growth IT Services comps.

Key risks include: high exposure to the public sector and reputational risks, a worsening macro, slower RRF conversion rates, talent acquisition, wage inflation and execution risk from an acquired company on the downside; and growth, margin expansion, faster progression in the UK, Norway and Greece as well as faster integration of the acquired company ahead of forecasts on the upside.

Ocado continues to target reaching cash break-even during FY26. This is clearly an important milestone for the group. For equity holders, the slower rollout of the group's technology to its key grocery partners, including a recalibration of one key relationship have impacted confidence. The growth Ocado can achieve in Tech Solutions remains the key driver of equity value. We believe the ongoing shift of grocery to online, the significant productivity gains from the group's technology, the pressure grocery partners face in terms of labour shortage and cost will drive take up of modules ultimately leading to a highly profitable, cash-generative business. Importantly, Ocado's technology has evolved to include new fulfilment products that bring its technology to a wider range of applications, including Store Based Automation. This should allow its technology to be used by grocers/retailers wherever they are in their online journey. We expect Ocado to remain volatile but have a positive stance and a Buy rating.

We value the group on a sum-of-the-parts basis. Each division is valued on a DCF (11.5% WACC with 12.5% cost of equity and 10.5% cost of debt) and terminal growth of 3%. We value Ocado's 50% stake in ORL at c.£700m, Tech Solutions at c.£1.5bn and Logistics at c. £230m. We make further adjustments for OIA, net debt, other financial assets and tax loss carried forward.

Risks include: channel shift of grocery to online is slower than anticipated; grocery partners find it difficult to adopt the group's technology in the way that hastens rollouts, its foray into non-grocery do not progress in the way envisaged, competition intensifies whether in terms of direct competitors or indirect solutions; and cash flows aren't realised in time or in such a way that means more capital is required that is more expensive or dilutive.

Beyond the benefits of PTC's shift to subscription, we see the company as very well positioned to benefit from the theme of Digital Production, notably around CAD and PLM as well as AI where PTC has shown a promising roadmap. The company's strategic partnerships with industry leaders in their respective fields address gaps in PTC's portfolio and distribution capabilities, and are set to drive incremental revenue growth while the exit of the IoT business, where PTC had limited success in the past, should further improve group performance. Buy.

We value PTC based on a ~24x CY26E EV/uFCF multiple, broadly in line with key direct peers, reflecting improving execution but remaining challenges in certain end markets.

Key downside risks include: (a) a macroeconomic downturn, particularly in key manufacturing end markets for PTC; (b) competitive share losses; (c) failure to execute as successfully as we expect on the shift to subscriptions; (d) faster-thanexpected technological change causing disruption to PTC; and (e) M&A that is viewed unfavorably by investors or poorly executed.

Over the past decade, revenue has achieved a CAGR of 14% to €2,296m in FY24, and Reply has delivered a 16% CAGR in earnings per share to €5.7 in FY24. While growth has slowed from peak (MSD in FY25 from >10%), Reply's current organic growth rate is notably stronger than IT services peers. We believe this reflects: Reply's long-lasting relationships within its customer base (no customer >10% sales); high levels of specialism within the boutique network of companies; the value it delivers through focus on innovative technologies; strong execution; and a strong focus on up-sell and cross-sell through incentivisation structures. We believe this will enable Reply to continue to drive growth. Buy.

Our target price is based on a 13x CY26E EV/EBITDA target multiple. This is above the average of the peer set (11x CY25E EV/EBITDA based on the Bloomberg consensus), which we see as reflecting Reply's standout combination of growth and profitability amid a downturn in the IT services sector. This is also in line with our DCF result (WACC of 8.7%: 9% cost of equity, using a 3.5% risk-free rate, market risk premium of 6% and beta of 0.9; 6% interest on debt and 28% tax rate).

Key risks to the downside include: a further downturn in the environment for IT services spend; exposure to tariff-impacted end market risks associated with a high proportion of fixed-price contracts; risks associated with ongoing integration of acquired businesses; control of the network structure; and exposure to cyclical end markets.

Sage is a major global accounting software vendor with a focus on SMEs. The company has gone through a significant investment phase in order to ensure it remains competitive. While operating margin is trending upwards again and pricing is increasing above historical averages, group growth has not delivered upside and remains below peers (~10%+), raising questions about expansion and new customer acquisition growth, in our view. Hence, we believe the stock warrants a discount to the global Software sector and see limited upside; Hold.

We are applying a 50/50 blend of 1) a ~25x CY26E P/E multiple; and 2) a ~22x CY26E EV/uFCF multiple, both representing a slight discount to peers to account for Sage's slower growth and/or still lower margins. We fully adjust our valuation metrics and Sage's peer group for share-based compensation (treating this as cost in P&L and CF metrics).

Key upside/downside risks include: 1) Sage may make acquisitions that are value enhancing or destructive, 2) Sage may be more/less successful than we expect in migrating its installed base to subscription at premium rates, 3) Sage may be more/ less successful than we expect in developing a Cloud-native successor product to its core product offerings, 4) Sage may find more/less cost savings than we expect to drive margin expansion, and 5) Sage may be more/less successful in acquiring new customers than we forecast.

SAP has a strong franchise as a leader in core application software, and we believe the company is making significant progress migrating its customer base to its Cloud offering around S/4HANA Cloud for ERP, while also winning new customers and continuing to grow outside ERP through its acquired Cloud businesses. SAP has now entered a "harvest" phase in 2024 with sustained multi-year, double-digit profitability growth and FCF expansion, supported by accelerating Cloud revenue growth and an efficiency program, which should drive further margin expansion beyond SAP's 2025 ambitions. We rate SAP Buy.

We value SAP at ~34x EV/uFCF, a slight premium to peers, accounting for share gains and faster earnings and FCF growth. This results in our price target, while our bull case analysis (faster Cloud migration of installed base, better underlying growth in the coming years) points to a potential valuation of E400 in the medium term.

Key risks to our thesis include: 1) market share loss in ERP as SAP transitions its clients to the Cloud; 2) emerging competition in its non-ERP Cloud businesses, driving share loss and/or pricing pressure; 3) failure to develop differentiated industry solutions for the Cloud and areas like AI, IoT or industry 4.0 through its expanding partner network; 4) political/macro shocks impacting the IT investment environment; 5) FX; and 6) potentially value-destructive M&A.

SoftwareONE, an IT Services company and Software/Cloud reseller, is aligned to key secular Software & IT Services trends among its clients as they drive digital transformation. These secular trends are expected to drive expansion in the company's IT Services TAM and growth in Software and Cloud product sales. However, the company's focus on bolt-on acquisitions to support the top-line growth is expected to act as a headwind for margins in the medium term. We remain cautious on the name. Hold.

We have updated our model and now value SoftwareOne at 12x '26e PF P/E, representing a discount to avg of peers at 19x. The lower multiple reflects underperformance in North America, execution and integration risks, as well as potentially weaker year-end budget flush in Dec, which could pose some downside risk to the company's FY25 guidance.

Downside risks include: dependence on a single major supplier, longer-thananticipated timeline to positive impact of GTM strategy, potential requirement to ramp onshore headcount as professional services business expand, negatively impacting margins, and lower synergies from the recent acquisition. Upside risks: faster-than-expected growth and margin expansion, higher synergies from the recent acquisition.

TeamViewer is an established player in the remote control software market, a large market that industry analysts expect to post a ~15% CAGR in the medium term, driven by digitization as well as vertical alignments with secular megatrends in the Industry 4.0 sphere. We believe TeamViewer is differentiated from its competitors in some technical aspects but is currently facing stronger price competition on its user base and is realizing slower progress on its Enterprise sales efforts, partially due to lackluster execution. Slow progress on diversifying its SME-heavy customer base into stickier and larger Enterprise deals, combined with increasing competitive pressure from the lower-end, significantly reduce visibility on the company's outlook and we rate the stock Hold.

We value TeamViewer on a 50/50 blend of FY26E P/E and EV/EBITDA of ~6x and ~8x, respectively, significant discounts to the broader software sector. The valuation reflects still a show-me story, lack of confidence in the company's enterprise pipeline conversion, and potential risks from a recessionary shock to its core SME customers, who currently still represent a material portion of overall billings.

Key downside risks include: 1) increasing competition on the free user base; 2) sequentially lower NRR than the current run rate; 3) possible revision of targets as the demand environment deteriorates as well as potentially lower margins from a higher cost base given the volatile billings mix. Key upside risks include: 1) potential consolidation candidate, given M&A interest in the sector; 2) continued cost containment measures offsetting increases in FTEs and salary inflation; and 3) an improving demand environment for enterprise as well as a material ramp up in IoT/ AR contribution to billings.

Temenos is a leader in the core banking software market, a large market that industry analysts expect to grow at an ~8% CAGR over the medium term, driven by digitization, regulation, and a switch from in-house to third-party software as banks look to reduce total cost of ownership. We believe that Temenos is differentiated from its competitors by its sustained high level of product development investment and strong ecosystem partnerships. However, we believe the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a more challenging end-market environment among banks for some time and that core banking initiatives may drop down the IT agenda as a result. We rate the stock a Hold.

Our target price is based on a simple average of: 1) ~19x our FY27 EPS estimate, and 2) ~18x EV/uFCF on our estimated FY27 uFCF. Both are in line with their peers.

Key upside risks include: 1) a less-severe downturn in the banking industry than we expect, 2) a mega-deal signing boosting license revenue, 3) more traction in expansion markets than we expect, and 4) subscription and SaaS revenue ramping up faster than anticipated. Key downside risks include: 1) a more severe downturn in the banking industry than we expect, 2) execution misses on implementation, 3) share loss to competition, and 4) execution misses on SaaS and subscription that leads to medium-term targets being revisited.
