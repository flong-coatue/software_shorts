In recent years Roper Technologies has accelerated the company's transformation from a manufacturer of industrial products to a vertical software franchise with operations spanning healthcare, education, financial services and logistics. ROP's acquisition-centric approach has produced durable compounding free cash flow with a growing portion of recurring revenue in targeted, defensible markets. Execution against future M&A opportunities (integration and optimization) should continue to be the drivers of long-term shareholder value rather than any singular asset in the portfolio. However, we believe specific market disruptions within the business are set to ease in the coming quarters. Where shares sit today vs. the achievement of the company's own long-term compounding algorithm: double-digit revenue growth, 45% operating leverage, and mid-teens FCF growth, ROP looks attractive to us. We are initiating coverage with an Overweight rating and a $600 PT.

· From Industrials to Software | A decade of evolution with more opportunity ahead. The transformation to a recurring revenue software model played slowly for many years but was specifically accelerated by a handful of 2021 & 2022 divestitures (TransCore, Zetec, CIVCO RT, Indicor) that boosted the software mix from 46% in 2019 to 75% by the end of 2022 (& on to 77% today). These divestitures have reduced the cyclicality and asset intensity of the business while yielding much higher margins.

· Pure-play vs. M&A | 'Where's the value in a roll-up?' Roper serves as an interesting contradiction to how most investors approach value creation in the software application market. 'Pure-play', 'best-of-breed', and 'defensible moat' are common monikers to define the competitive advantage of a software company that has developed a focused approach to a certain market opportunity, continuously investing in R&D & intellectual property to grow/retain market share. Roper's acquisition-centric approach is antithetical to the software standard, but we believe is unappreciated in some key ways: 1.) Roper tends to be acquisitive in service of existing franchises rather than fragmenting the portfolio 2.) the risk of a pure-play entrant is often low as niche markets can often be too small to realistically attract new venture capital, and 3.) we argue with AI, R&D is made more effective, allowing ROP to maintain a competitive organic portfolio.

· Recent market weaknesses could ease and lift organic outlook. Despite reducing the cyclicality of top line with recurring revenue, Roper nonetheless has exposure to cyclical end-markets. In recent years, the company has seen headwinds from logistics, but more recently in 2025, market dysfunctions have been called out in GovCon & Neptune. We believe the reopening of the Federal government, a lower rate environment, or any copper tariff relief would ease organic growth headwinds and improve sentiment on Roper's durable growth prospects.

Reliance on future acquisitions & integrations, health of customer end-markets.

Roper is a diversified software & tech company with an M&A-based growth strategy.

Roper Technologies is a diversified vertical software & technology company with operations that span multiple sectors (e.g. education, healthcare, logistics) across 29 sub-businesses. Roper's acquisition-centric approach focuses on marketleading products from niche markets that can drive longterm compounding results.

Despite being public since 1992, much of Roper's history has been as a provider of industrial products. The company entered the software realm in 2004 with an acquisition of DAT and later expanded with CBORD in 2008, but the transformation to a vertical software company was specifically catalyzed by several major divestitures in 2021 & 2022 that exited the company from industrial products.

· TransCore divested for $2.680B in cash · Zetec divested for $350M in cash · CIVCO Radiotherapy divested for $120M in cash

· Sale of majority stake in Indicor, retained 49% minority stake · 51% equity interest valued at ~$829M Source: Company materials & filings

· Reliance on future acquisitions & integrations. Future growth is highly dependent on ROP's ability to integrate new acquisitions. The company could fail to identify suitable candidates, negotiate attractive terms, obtain acceptable financing, and successfully integrate acquired businesses. Acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt or equity issuances, and expenses which could have a material & adverse impact on the business & future acquisition capacity. · Health of customer end-markets. Roper's portfolio of companies may have specific risk factors tied to those companies' specific end markets such as exposure to certain supply chains - which more recently have been impacted by tariffs & trade agreements. Political dysfunction has led to an adverse impact on businesses that serve governmental entities or governmental contractors. While the diversification of the portfolio may mitigate these risks, end market impacts can weigh on overall organic growth & investor sentiment of the company as result.

· Departure of key personnel. Given the acquisition centric strategy, portfolio management & corporate development skills are tied to the process & people of Roper at the time - rather than intellectual property tied to a product. Therefore, departure of key personnel including leadership may be inherently more difficult to manage and may cause more outsized disruption to the company's growth prospects.
