Debate on the size of the Q4 beat and anxiety on the initial FY27 guide are the key concerns weighing on shares. While the initial guide is something to get thru, our checks remain constructive and recent CIO survey results screen positive, suggesting another strong year of growth ahead - stay OW. Why Are Shares Underperforming? Over the last 3 months, shares of Snowflake are down nearly 20% and down ~4% YTD. We continue to believe that demand trends for Snowflake remain solid but our investor conversations highlight the following concerns, which have been weighing on the stock...

· Debating the Magnitude of the Product Revenue Beat. With product revenue beating the midpoint of guidance by +5.1% in 2QFY26 but by +2.7% in 3QFY26, investor debate shifts to the magnitude of beat achievable in Q4. We note that management guided QoQ growth for Q4 the strongest in 4 years. While management was vocal intra-quarter pre Q3 results about not extrapolating the strong Q2 beat (as Q2 benefited from large migrations) the company communicated to us that it is not in the practice of commenting on the magnitude of beat on a quarterly basis. We would note that post the end of the ZIRP environment, Q4 has represented the smallest beat versus consensus on average and that for this Q4 a number of the major holidays fell in the middle of the week - a dynamic that should have been taken into account in the guide.

· Fears About the FY27 Initial Guide. According to FactSet, consensus is expecting $5.546 billion in product revenue in FY27, which represents growth of just under +25% on current FY26 estimates. As we noted in our December piece Assessing the Risk to 2026 Guidance , while we do not see the FY27 outlook as a lay-up, we do not see FY27 consensus for product revenue as unachievable particularly when compared to a beat-adjusted 4QFY26 exit growth. That said, investor anxiety relating to the FY27 outlook rests on: 1) new CFO Brian Robins providing guidance for the first time and 2) FY27 consensus implying a modest premium to the net-new dollars that are expected to be added in FY26

· Can a Rising Tide Keep Lifting All Major Boats? Data infrastructure has been one of the few areas of software spending strength over the last 12-18 months as customers prioritize data modernization and data readiness initiatives as part of a broader enterprise AI strategy. While we believe the competitive discussion on Snowflake is in a much better place than in late CY23 thru 1HCY24, with Snowflake's product revenue growth slowing from +32% in Q2 to +29% in the most recent quarter and with Microsoft touting 60%+ growth in Fabric and Snowflake's most direct private competitor citing 55%+ growth in December, investors question whether the competitive environment for Snowflake is intensifying.

Recent CIO Survey Points to Durability of Growth. Along with constructive partner commentary, our recent CIO Survey results point to Snowflake's growing stature among major software platforms and improved positioning of the core data warehousing market in the eyes of CIOs. Key highlights from our CIO survey include: 1) Snowflake heads into CY26 tied with Microsoft with the highest expected growth, outpacing Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, Adobe and Oracle; 2) Snowflake is expected to see the largest acceleration in growth in CY26 among the major software platform cited above; 3) the company is expected to see the 2nd highest net spending performance in CY26 (% increase minus % spending decrease) among the same peer group; 4) CIOs see 3rd party cloud data warehouses as the preferred way of meeting their analytics needs over the next 12 months; and 5) 37% of CIOs expect to use a 3rd party cloud data warehouse/lakehouse service as the data architecture powering their AI projects in production environments- up from 27% today.

Growth Likely Accelerates in Q4. Our assessment of the demand environment and evidence of traction across Snowflake's product portfolio suggest that product revenue growth can accelerate to at least 30% in Q4, which would imply a 2.4% beat relative to the midpoint of guide. Looking to the FY27 outlook, management has stated that the biggest factor influencing the FY27 guide will be consumption trends from the middle of January into February. There is clearly more time needed to make the assessment but at this stage we think the company can guide inline with consensus on a dollars basis ($5.546 billion) if not on a growth basis ( +25%).

Reiterate OW with $299 PT. While FY27 guidance may present investors with a near-term hurdle to get through, we believe an acceleration back to 30% product revenue growth is in the cards in 4QFY26. Furthermore, with partner conversations pointing to continued high priority of cloud migration and data modernization initiatives heading into CY26, we see relative stability in the core data warehousing business, a continued ramp of the data engineering business (likely at a $300+ million revenue run-rate) and the first full year of contribution from the AI portfolio (including the first full year of Snowflake Intelligence) which is already at $100+ million run rate. Our current base case forecasts +24% product revenue growth in FY27, but sustained execution across these 3 pieces of Snowflake's growth equation could result in product revenue growth closer to +30%, pushing shares closer to our $299 price target.

Our base case assumes revenue grows at a 23% CAGR (CY24-CY30), driving ~$12.5 billion in revenues in CY30 as operating margins scale to ~22% in that year, and generating ~$3.6 billion in FCF growing at a ~26% FCF CAGR from CY28-CY30. We apply a ~45x EV/FCF multiple to that FCF (~1.7x EV/FCF/Growth) and discount back at a 11.1% discount rate.
