26 Jan 2026 20:52:32 ET John Godyn AC john.godyn@citi.com +1-212-816-8014 Jeremy E Jason jeremy.jason@citi.com +1-212-816-7789 Flagship | MustC | Risk & Adaptation Investment Strategies | | Innovation Lab | Super-Sector Analysis | CITI’S TAKE

BAH’s F3Q26 Adj. EPS of $1.77 beat VA consensus of $1.28, largely due to taxes. Results showed signs of impact from the government shutdown but management expressed optimism in green shoots and exposure to growth in AI and Cyber. BAH expects to see outsized revenue growth if the budget grows significantly, as some expect. That said, shortly after, investors were reminded that the backdrop for Civil remains complex and has yet to bottom as BAH lost Treasury contracts. Both the immediate positive reaction to the print as well as the the subsequent negative reaction to the contract losses, considering they only represent ~$5M in annual spend, were both over-reactions in their respective directions, in our view. We update our FY26 EPS to $6.00, the low end of new FY26 Adj. EPS guidance of $5.95-$6.15, to incorporate data from the print, lower taxes, and leave our Price Target unchanged at $109. Neutral / High Risk Price (26 Jan 26 16:00) US$93.93 Expected share price return 16.0% Target price

We rate BAH as Neutral/High Risk (2H). Our view is based on the following: (1) BAH revenue growth is underperforming defense services peers, primarily due to weakness in its Civil segment, (2) Civil segment weakness is also creating a margin overhang, (3) Book-to-bill trends have been worsening in most recent data, (4) Offsetting Civil weakness, BAH exposure to higher U.S. Defense and AI spending is a relative growth driver, (5) Strong partnerships with marquee tech players reinforce BAH technology leadership, (6) Extensive venture arm allows for strategic access to newer technologies and additional returns, and (7) Attractive valuation enhances entry point. Valuation

We derive our $109 base case price target for BAH using the average of multiple valuation methodologies. Specifically, we apply a 12x EV/EBITDA Multiple to LTM F3Q28 EBITDA and we apply a 16x P/E Multiple to LTM F3Q28 EPS. These multiples are justified using historical valuation ranges in conjunction with trading relationships to fundamental factors such as margins, returns, growth and earnings momentum. Risks We rate shares of BAH High Risk due to the company’s exposure to short-cycle government contracting environment, which has proven to be riskier than long-cycle programs.

BAH has potential for upside as strong procurement dynamics and potential wins could improve revenue outlook. We also highlight the company’s expansion of outcome-based technology solutions in quantum cryptography, AI, and NextG wireless networks that could enable faster mission outcomes. That said, BAH faces significant risks stemming from its heavy dependence on U.S. government contracts as funding delays, government shutdowns, and budgetary constraints directly threaten revenue stability and backlog realization. The company also faces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities and talent retention challenges, which could pose critical operational risks such as service failures and security breaches. If the impact on the company from any of these factors proves to be greater or less than we anticipate, the stock will either outperform or underperform our target price.

The research analysts primarily responsible for the preparation and content of this research report are either (i) designated by “AC” in the author block or (ii) listed in bold alongside content which is attributable to that analyst. If multiple AC analysts are designated in the author block, each analyst is certifying with respect to the entire research report other than (a) content attributable to another AC certifying analyst listed in bold alongside the content and (b) views expressed solely with respect to a specific issuer which are attributable to another AC certifying analyst identified in the price charts or rating history tables for that issuer shown below. Each of these analysts certify, with respect to the sections of the report for which they are responsible: (1) that the views expressed therein accurately reflect their personal views about each issuer and security referenced and were prepared in an independent manner, including with respect to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates; and (2) no part of the research analyst's compensation was, is, or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the specific recommendations or views expressed by that research analyst in this report.

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES Analysts’ compensation is determined by Citi Research management and Citigroup’s senior management and is based upon activities and services intended to benefit the investor clients of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates (the “Firm”). Compensation is not linked to specific transactions or recommendations. Like all Firm employees, analysts receive compensation that is impacted by overall Firm profitability which includes investment banking, sales and trading, and principal trading revenues. One factor in equity research analyst compensation is arranging corporate access events between institutional clients and the management teams of covered companies. Typically, company management is more likely to participate when the analyst has a positive view of the company.

For financial instruments recommended in the Product in which the Firm is not a market maker, the Firm is a liquidity provider in such financial instruments (and any underlying instruments) and may act as principal in connection with transactions in such instruments. The Firm is a regular issuer of traded financial instruments linked to securities that may have been recommended in the Product. The Firm regularly trades in the securities of the issuer(s) discussed in the Product. The Firm may engage in securities transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Product and, with respect to securities covered by the Product, will buy or sell from customers on a principal basis. Unless stated otherwise neither the Research Analyst nor any member of their team has viewed the material operations of the Companies for which an investment view has been provided within the past 12 months.

For important disclosures (including copies of historical disclosures) regarding the companies that are the subject of this Citi Research product ("the Product"), please contact Citi Research, 388 Greenwich Street, 6th Floor, New York, NY, 10013, Attention: Legal/Compliance [E6WYB6412478]. In addition, the same important disclosures, with the exception of the Valuation and Risk assessments and historical disclosures, are contained on the Firm's disclosure website at https://www.citivelocity.com/cvr/eppublic/citi_research_disclosures . Valuation and Risk assessments can be found in the text of the most recent research note/report regarding the subject company. Pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation a history of all Citi Research recommendations published during the preceding 12-month period can be accessed via Citi Velocity ( https://www.citivelocity.com/cv2 ) or your standard distribution portal. Historical disclosures (for up to the past three years) will be provided upon request. Citi Research Equity Ratings Distribution 12 Month Rating Catalyst Watch

Data current as of 01 Jan 2026 Buy Hold Sell Buy Hold Sell Citi Research Global Fundamental Coverage (Neutral=Hold) 60% 32% 8% 37% 47% 16% % of companies in each rating category that are investment banking clients 36% 40% 28% 40% 34% 35% Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings: Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned. Investment Ratings:

Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign “Rating Suspended” status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—“ and “-“ respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned “Under Review” status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
