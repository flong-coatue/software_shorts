China's internet sector has been the top performer YTD-2025 with a +36.5% return, outpacing SEA's +18.3%, India's +17.6%, Japan's +16.8%, US's +16.2%, Korea's +12.8%. By contrast KOSPI has risen +64%, HSI +29%, Nikkei +26%, S&P 500 +15.8%, Nifty +10.4%. On these returns, riskoff is being seen in China, Japan and the US amid year-end profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. While the debate on AI valuations persists, we expect China's internet companies to trade at discounts to global peers due to geopolitical and AI supply-chain issues. But with AI adoption brisk, competition among China's AI players in 2026 could intensify - from

AI cloud infra, to chatbots, to applications. Monetization is likely to trail user traffic growth and that of global peers. Our 1H26 Top Picks: 1) Tencent, BABA - core AI plays; 2) TCOM, NTES for resilient/stable earnings growth; 3) J&T cross-border exposure; 4) Century Huatong among A shares.

AI Cloud Infra, Chatbots and Agents - The AI themes for China in 2026 are likely to be: 1) recurring revs growth of cloud infra/model stack/inference token usage (BABA, Baidu); 2) user traffic turf war between AI chatbots (Qwen, Doubao, Hunyuan) as key internet players (BABA, Bytedance, Tencent) rush to capture AI era traffic gateway for future ecosystem monetization; and 3) vertical players (Meituan, TCOM, Didi, etc), deploying their self-trained proprietary data AI agents to stay ahead of potential disruption and seeking to strengthen user engagement and monetization upside. We expect most internet companies will improve operating leverage through productivity gains from AI-assisted cost optimization, with some enjoying reacceleration of top-line growth thanks to effective AI agent deployment.

China AI chatbots penetrating global markets - Globally, ChatGPT leads by a wide margin, at 800m global MAUs (Nov 25), followed by Gemini at 335m. Dola (by Bytedance affiliate) and DeepSeek rank 4 & 5, after Perplexity at #3. Combining Dola (47m) + Doubao (197m), Bytedance's AI Chat is now ranked #3 globally with total MAUs of ~250m, a significant milestone that could draw more attention. Resilient leisure & entertainment wallet spend - Fast adoption of AI assistant tools is likely to improve consumers' productivity both in and outside work environments, which should give them more time for leisure and entertainment. Demand for travel and online gaming should support stable and resilient earnings growth for OTA and gaming companies, which we believe provide good portfolio diversification to offset higher risk from any AI hype.

Investment risks -Geopolitical risks, AI supply-chain constraints, muted consumption sentiment in the absence of stimulus policies, merchant support measures weigh on profits, lock-in of consumer wallet share through membership investment, more intense competition in AI apps, and slowdown in capital return. 3Q25 wrap & 4Q25 outlook - Of the 44 internet companies in our universe that have reported 3Q25 results, 18/27 delivered revs/earnings beats, 20/9 reported inline revs/earnings and 6/8 missed revs/earnings. In terms of 4Q guidance, 2/3/1 companies beat/flat-lined/missed on rev; on profits, 1 guidance beat, 1 missed.

Compared to previous quarters, the 3Q25 result season concluded with more companies delivering profit beats and more companies delivering in-line revs, which we attribute to continued cost optimization efforts and possible AIenhanced savings or productivity gains. Less exciting revs growth could be related to a muted macro, continued merchant support measures and higher mix of counter-revs subsidies. Into 4Q25, many subsectors face high base/tough comp levels for their top line while competition remains intense across multiple industry verticals that could weigh on profitability growth.

Compared with our 2Q25 wrap, where China internet sectors outperformed US peers as of Sept 1, in this 3Q25 wrap, YTD (as of Nov 28), the overall China Internet sector continued to outperform US peers, with BABA leading with an 86% return as of Nov 28, followed by Tencent at 47%, PDD at 20%; Meituan underperformed its US peers at -32%. Alphabet has broken out in the past couple months and ranked the highest among US peers at a 69% return, followed by Netflix at 21%; Meta and Amazon have trailed with 11% and 6% returns.

contrast, while Tencent's performance caught up with Baba's (figure 5) in August and early Sept, it could not participate in the further rally of BABA shares post Sept following BABA's upbeat FY1Q26 print and optimistic outlook at the Apsara conference on IDC capacity expectations. Both Baidu and Alphabet (Figure 6) underperformed their peers until Aug and then both started to rise, with Baidu breaking out in Sept following optimism about its Kunlun chip and Alphabet breaking away from Baidu and other US peers following the growing traction of its latest Gemini model. Alibaba and Amazon (both are in ecommerce and cloud services) have had different share price performance paths, which we attribute mainly to the sentiment on AI, foundation model capability and acceleration of cloud revs growth for BABA.

After outperforming Tencent from May to Oct, NetEase started to lose momentum likely due to sector rotation or year-end profit-taking (Figure 8). In ecommerce, BABA leads (+86%) VIPS (+46%), PDD (+20%), JD (-14%) and Meituan (-32%), reflecting the food delivery competition and lack of fundamental catalysts (Figure 9). Comparing Meituan to TCOM and Meituan to Kuaishou, we note that the share price performance divergence for Meituan/TCOM started from June while the divergence for Meituan/Kuaishou started earlier, from Feb 2025.

While both Meituan and TCOM have underperformed peers, TCOM saw a big divergence after its 2Q25 print (Figure 12). Kuaishou and Bili continue to trade in close correlation, with Bili further closing the gap with Kuaishou in the last two months (Figure 13).

YTD price performance of Kuaishou and Bilibili Below are a few interesting share-price performance comparisons, including Baidu vs Kuaishou (figure 14), TME and Spotify (figure 15), Alibaba vs. Meituan (figure 16), Kanzhun vs. Full Track Alliance (figure 17), TCOM vs YMM (figure 18), and TME vs. NTES (figure 19).

n Tencent ( 0700.HK; Buy; TP HK$751) : We retain our constructive view on Tencent as the company continues to demonstrate solid execution in driving steady/sustainable top- and bottom-line growth while pursuing its AI aspiration in the forefront of enterprise and user applications. Supply-chain constraints have not slowed Tencent's commitment to upgrading its foundation model architecture and developing agentic AI capabilities within Weixin, which we believe will yield notable investment return ahead. With solid grossing from a growing number of evergreen titles, upgraded ad platforms and AI cloud infrastructure, the growth trajectory across segments looks clear. Maintain Buy with a TP of HK$751.

n Alibaba (BABA.N/9988.HK; Buy; TP US$225/HK$223): We maintain our Buy rating on BABA with SOTP of US$225/HK$223. We continue to view BABA as one of the best AI plays for China AI exposure. BABA looks well-positioned to capture the AI evolution that should translate to sustainable cloud revs growth with efficiency margins upside in coming years. Leveraging its strong AI capabilities including the Qwen model, multi-modal cloud infrastructure and strong traction across industry enterprises in China, we expect Ali Cloud revs to sustain high level of cloud revs growth in the coming quarters following decent reaccelerated growth in the past 6 quarters. We expect synergies between Shangou and marketplaces to bring more resilient CMR growth despite lapse of fee and higher base and decent EBITA rebound post the heavy investment stage.

n Trip.com (TCOM : Buy; TP US$86): We remain positive on TCOM given resilient China travel demand and strong momentum for Trip.com. The recent recovery in the hotels industry presents tailwinds for domestic business, while outbound has shown decent trajectory despite a normalizing base. Trip.com is performing well thanks to strong enhancement in user engagement along with product and service upgrades. We remain optimistic over TCOM's margin trajectory ahead thanks to its more disciplined spending on both China and int'l businesses. Maintain Buy with a TP of US$86.

n NetEase (NTES: Buy; TP US$161): We like NetEase for its operation and execution track record developing and publishing high-quality, longevity games franchise titles. Not only is the company maintaining and achieving record grossing momentum of evergreen FWJ PC and FWJ Mobile , it is also consistently delivering growing evergreen franchises with increasing global success such as Where Wind Meets and Sword of Justice. Its renewed and deeper operation success of Blizzard titles further proves its localization and publishing strengths. Entering 2026, with steady and resilient grossing from flagship evergreen titles, together with upcoming release of Ananta , we believe NTES' gaming portfolio performance will further strengthen. Together with solid execution and stable shareholder return and what we think are undemanding valuations, we maintain Buy with a TP of US$161.

- n J&T Express (1519.HK; Buy; TP HK$12) : J&T Express remains our Top Pick in the China logistics sector. With a stabilizing China earnings outlook, J&T Express is gaining strong momentum in SEA driven by solid performance of its key customers and J&T's further wallet share gain thanks to its superior competitive edge vs. peers. We also see decent potential from new markets where J&T is enjoying rapid expansion of its Chinese customers and also penetrating into local ecommerce platforms. Maintain Buy with a TP of HK$12.

- n Century Huatong (002602.SZ; Buy; TP Rmb22): We expect near-term catalysts to include upcoming 12-month buyback program at Rmb0.5-1bn, potential media ETF/index inclusion by mid-Dec and possible new flows from HK Stock Connect and margin trading. We also expect a solid and resilient performance of Whiteout Survival and Kingshot in 4Q25/1Q26. With new hires from Century Games mainly focusing on new game development, we expect Century Huatong will continue to actively invest in global strategy and casual game markets. Maintain Buy with TP Rmb22, based on 20x 2026E PE.

We expect AI themed names to feature in key portfolio allocation decisions. In addition to AI cloud infra and LLM, 2026 could mark the race among AI chatbots and agents to explore potential monetization upside. Gaming names possess both resilient earnings and AI amplification while travel/leisure/entertainment services could gain further traction in wallet spend share.

This year was an inflection year for China AI sentiment thanks to the 'DeepSeek' moment in end-Jan. As noted back in our 4Q24 wrap, it triggered transformations including: reversal of investor sentiment toward the China market and valuations, especially for internet giants with AI plays like BABA and Tencent; and fast adoption of AI Assistant chatbots by a vast majority of consumers and deployment of LLM models across big and small enterprises across all industries and government departments. In addition, we also noticed a shift in capital allocation toward prioritizing investment in AI while shareholder returns for some companies slowed down. And investors had higher tolerance for core business performance as long as the AI story looked promising.

Fast forward to end-Nov/early Dec, as the market went through big volatility in early-April and the mega cross-investment projects by US tech giants into Open AI, etc., as well as optimistic IDC capacity comments made by Alibaba's CEO during the Apsara Conference in Sept, the share price performance of AI names continued to outperform yet face volatility as investors look to locking in profits. As we head into 2026, while the debate on whether we are in an AI valuation bubble or not rages on, we believe China internet stocks are likely to remain at discounts vs global peers amid geopolitical uncertainty and AI supply chain constraints. That said, with the adoption speed brisk, we expect intense AI competition among China players across AI infrastructure, AI Assistant chatbots to AI applications in 2026, with monetization likely trailing user traffic growth and that of global peers .

The AI themes for China in 2026 are likely to be: 1) recurring revs growth of cloud infra/model stack/inference token usage (BABA, Baidu); 2) user traffic turf war between AI chatbots (Qwen, Doubao, Hunyuan) as key internet players (BABA, Bytedance, Tencent) rush to capture AI era traffic gateway for future ecosystem monetization; and 3) vertical players (Meituan, TCOM, Didi, etc), deploying their self-trained proprietary data AI agents to stay ahead of potential disruption and seeking to strengthen user engagement and monetization upside. We expect most internet companies will improve operating leverage through productivity gains from AI-assisted cost optimization, with some enjoying reacceleration of top-line growth thanks to effective AI agent deployment.

n Tencent Cloud: In 3Q25, business services revs grew teens % yoy despite supply-chain constraints on sourcing GPUs, driven by cloud services and fees collected on Mini Shops ecommerce transactions. Management has highlighted notable YoY growth in revenues from cloud storage and data management products. During the quarter, Tencent has enhanced Hunyuan LLM's complex reasoning capabilities especially in coding, math and science. At the same time, Tencent will continue to strengthen the synergies between Weixin and Yuanbao by launching multiple AI features on Weixin powered by Yuanbao. Mgmt believes it is possible that ultimately there will be an AI agent embedded within Weixin to help users to achieve multiple missions within the Weixin ecosystem (link).

- n Baidu AI Cloud: In 3Q25, AI cloud revs grew 21% yoy to Rmb6.2bn, including AI cloud infrastructure revenues reaching Rmb4.2bn, +33% yoy. Within AI cloud infrastructure, subscription-based AI accelerator infrastructure revenues grew 128% yoy, accelerating from around 50% last quarter. AI applications revenues amounted to Rmb2.6bn, including Baidu Wenku and Baidu Drive, where AI has enhanced the functionalities across these products. For AI native marketing services, which include agents and digital humans, revenues reached Rmb2.8bn representing a robust 262% yoy increase and contributing 18% of Baidu Core online marketing revenues, up from 4% a year ago. Adding altogether, revenue from AI-powered business grew over 50% yoy to roughly Rmb10bn in 3Q25. (link).

As shown in Figures 28-31, it is clear that Doubao by ByteDance is leading the AI Assistant Chatbot in China with 197m MAUs and 54mn DAUs as of Oct, followed by DeepSeek at #2 and Tencent's Yuanbao at #3. Prior to the revamp and rebranding of Qwen, BABA's Tongyi app captured a very small number of users. However, since repositioning with Qwen Chat powered by the latest Qwen Max 3 model and others on Nov 17 th , BABA disclosed that Qwen app has been downloaded by >10m within a week since launch (figure 32-35), with DAU spiking and reaching 16.7m as Nov 21, per Quest Mobile.

Globally, ChatGPT continues to grow strongly, reaching 800m global MAUs as of Nov 2025, significantly ahead of all other AI apps. That said, with continued improvements through newer versions of models, Google Gemini MAU has climbed robustly in recent months to reach 335m as of Nov 2025, up from 128m a year ago. Perplexity ranks # 3 with 50m MAUs, followed by Dola at 46.6m, DeepSeek 39mn, Grok 31.9mn, Microsoft Copilot 29,96mn and Meta Ai at 17.8mn and Claude at 10.6mn. In comparison, Alibaba's Qwen global stood at 1.48m as of Nov 2025.

Before BABA decided to push its revamped Qwen Chat to global markets, some of Chinese AI chats like the Doubao international version Dola (only recently renamed, previously called Cici (published by ByteDance affiliate) have been penetrating quite a number of countries, especially emerging markets like Latam countries and Southeast Asia. Dola's MAU has grown rapidly in the past few months to reach 46.6m in Nov 2025 (ranked #4), up from 16.38m a year ago. If Dola (46.6m) + Doubao (197m) are combined, Bytedance's AI Chat would have ranked as #3 with total MAU of ~250m globally, a significant milestone. Figure 44.

- n TCOM: OTAs are actively integrating AIGC technologies into their operation. Beside coding development and customer service, the key area of the adoption is on travel assistant for its users by leveraging capabilities from major LLMs. TCOM's TripGenie is now used in mor than 200 countries and regions, with related users growing over 200% yoy in 1H25, supporting interaction of audio and image, travel planning, real-time translation and booking service to enhance user engagement. Like TCOM, Tongcheng also rolled out its AI-driven travel planner DeepTrip in Mar 2025 to provide viable and personalized travel itineraries for users, attracting millions of users with a steadily increasing number of orders placed directly through the portal.

n Meituan: Meituan is advancing its AI strategy by building capabilities in three core areas: self-developed large language models, AI productization, and AI infrastructure. The company has launched its open-source "Long Cat" series of self-trained LLMs, which have received positive feedback and are now deeply integrated into its applications to drive innovation. For merchants, Meituan has upgraded AI tools like "Shangqitong" for product planning and site selection, and "Smart Shopkeeper" with new modules for AI reception, operational analysis, and review responses. For consumers, the company is testing both a standalone AI assistant, "Xiaomei," and an integrated assistant, "Ask Xiaotuan," within the Meituan app, which can handle the entire service process from search and price comparison to order generation across all local service categories. Internally, Meituan is also developing AI programming tools to boost employee efficiency.

n Didi: Didi has an AI Lab focus on machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, voice recognition, operations research and statistical studies and has been focusing on investing in AI and self-driving technology. On Sept 25, 2025, Didi started to perform open beta testing of its AI Travel Assistant 'Xiao Di' which is embedded in the Didi dispatch system which uses intelligent understanding of user needs to provide them with customized car service plans. While in early stage, we believe that through its large volume of data and user traffic, applying AI tools will ensure Didi's app stays relevant and provide personalized experience to its users.

After the development of a new generation of video models in 2024, roll-outs by various domestic and int'l players in 2025 have not only intensified competition for the industry but have also pushed technology development and stimulated the adoption of video generation models by a wider group of users. The technology enhancement this year mainly involves better video effects and physical world simulation, audio-video synchronization, longer videos generated and easier editing tools.

Google released the Voe3 model in May 2025, which enhances visual fidelity, offers creators greater control and integrates audio directly into video generation. OpenAI's Sora2 rolled out in Sep 2025 has attracted strong response from consumer users for its strong physical world aroused simulation, native audiovideo synchronization and innovative features like Cameo and Remix. Bytedance's latest versions of Seedance has caught up with leading players in terms of technology, and Kuaishou has persistently upgraded its Kling model for drama and film quality videos generation with user friendly editing tools. Minimax's Hailuo is also a major player in video generation models. Beside Bytedance, Kuaishou and Minimax, domestic leading internet players like BABA, Tencent and Baidu have also rolled out video generation models.

Strategy of Kuaishou's Kling: Kuaishou's mgmt sees many more video generation models rolled out by peers now vs. 2 years ago but mainly views Seedance from ByteDance and Veo3 from Google as direct competitors in terms of accumulation of video data and technologies. The strategic focus ahead for Kling is 1) to generate videos with effects at film and drama level, 2) persistently upgrade its prompt tools to make it easier for users to generate videos, and 3) further push and explore monetization opportunities.

As AI Assistant tools support users' productivity improvement at work and personal lives, users might have more time to spare for leisure and entertainment activities. We believe the gaming industry will likely see benefits from AI adoption. Despite a relatively stable China online gamer base at 679m in 1H25, per CNG data, monthly ARPU of China gamers continued to rebound meaningfully since 2022 to reach Rmb41 in 1H25, +13.3% yoy. We believe such growth was driven by a normalized regulatory environment, resilient new game supplies and continued differentiation by top-tier and second-tier online gaming players through genre segmentation and slowdown of new game launches to focus on evergreen title operations and boost hit rate.

We also believe the online gaming sector would remain as the frontier for AIGC application in terms of productivity and efficiency gains in art design, content generation and further boost creativity such as AI NPC, AI companion and AI livestreaming features. Together with rich cash positions, generous shareholder returns and steady margin profiles, we believe the online gaming sector will likely generate a decent earnings profile entering 2026E with ample opportunities for further differentiation in the domestic market and huge TAM tapping into the overseas gamer base. Below are recent AI developments by major China game companies:

n Tencent: According to Peacekeeper Elite official account dated Nov 26 (link), Peacekeeper Elite has officially kicked off a new testing on AI gameplay by introducing industry's first AI pet companion supporting real-time voice recognition to provide more immersive interactive and diversified gameplay. n NetEase: Reported by GameMatrix dated Nov 26 (link), Where Winds Meet recent debut in overseas market on Steam, PlayStation and Epic on Nov 14, with concurrent players surpassing 250K on Steam in the second weekend, representing the top performing Chinese-developed game on Steam by concurrent players. In addition to high quality content and graphics designs, overseas gamers were also attracted to AI NPCs in which the article quoted that some gamers took hours talking to AI NPCs to learn about game background and Chinese culture. This article further suggested that this may further change the perception of overseas gamers in adopting AI gameplay and AI content generation in game title.

n Century Huatong: According to an offline investor meeting hosted by Century Huatong on Nov 25 (link), management leveraged AI tools to improve production efficiency including 2D art design, map design, music design and promotions video by 60-80%. The company also launched automated beta process through its proprietary PhraseTest platform to shorten game development time and beta cycle. n Kingnet: Kingnet also accelerated its AI commercialization progress through AI game development platform Soon, which targets small game developers and AI companion app EVE , both of which will start to monetize in 1Q26E.

Besides gaming as an entertainment choice, we believe improving productivity gains from AI will also lead to growing demand for leisure activity like traveling.

Before COVID, China travel spending and volume showed robust trajectory, resulting in a persistently rising ratio for travel spending to total GDP which reached 5.7% in 2019 from 4.9% in 2015. COVID disrupted the travel industry during 2020 to 2022. Post COVID, travel demand quickly recovered and surpassed the pre-COVID level in 2024, but the ratio of travel spending to total GDP at 4.3% was still below 2019 level, implying decent potential for further recovery ahead. Into 2025, China travel demand remained resilient mainly driven by volume growth despite some pressures on pricing. Recently we have observed ADR recovery for hotel industry, probably indicating stabilizing pricing pressures.

China's Int'l flights passenger volume (including HK, Macau & Taiwan) already recovered to pre-COVID levels in 3Q25, and the growth momentum has remained decent despite a normalizing base. We expect a more normalized growth rate for the industry volume ahead but still see decent room of more Chinese citizens to travel abroad gradually, considering 1) only >160m Chinese owned effective passports in mid-2025 vs. its total population of 1.4bn, 2) gradual shift of household spending more toward experience consumption, and 3) more friendly visa policies for Chinese citizens.

Per a report by Mastercard and Ctrip, the consumption patterns of Chinese outbound tourists are undergoing a shift from traditional shopping and accommodation toward experience-oriented activities. The data reveals that expenditure on transportation has seen the highest growth, indicating a preference for convenient and diverse travel options. Spending on entertainment and dining follows closely, highlighting a greater emphasis on immersive local experiences and cultural activities. This shift is further evidenced by increased per-capita spending at destinations, suggesting longer stays amid deeper cultural immersion. In contrast, growth in spending on shopping has slowed, implying that tourists are becoming more value-conscious.

Per TCOM's data, a clear trend towards longer and more immersive travel experiences is evident among foreigners visiting China, which is particularly the case for older tourist demographics. Per the data, 29% of young travelers aged 1824 stayed for 4-7 days and 16% stayed for over a week in 1H25, while extended stays over 7 days are chosen by 27/20% for tourists aged above 60 and 50-59. The proportion of visitors engaging in short 1-3 day trips decreased across all age groups in 1H25 vs. 2024, implying inbound visitors seeking deeper cultural and experimental engagement.

In 3Q25, 1) various advertising companies including Weibo and Focus Media noted advertising revenue growth from e-commerce players due to step-up in competition in quick commerce, while Tencent noted increases in all categories during the quarter; 2) AI capabilities have supported ad eCPM and helped advertising efficiency, as noted by Tencent, Kuaishou, Weibo, etc.; 3) Players like Weibo and Focus Media remain positive on e-commerce advertiser spending in 4Q25E due to continued competition in quick commerce, and entering 2026E, key events including Winter Olympics in Feb 2026 and World Cup in Jun 2026 are expected to contribute to advertising budgets.

Intensified competition is not a new thing for China's ecommerce sector. Specifically in 3Q25, competition between BABA and Meituan intensified in quick commerce, and competition further extended to local services. The competition between the two giants also impacted other players including PDD, which noted high competitive pressures. Entering 4Q25E, both BABA and Meituan reiterated the strategic importance of quick commerce investment, while subsidy intensities might have peaked in July/Aug, and see signs of moderation post Singles Day promotion (per Meituan management), both still stressing that competition remains dynamic. BABA expects quick commerce loss to narrow in 4Q25E with improving efficiency, but the EBITA fluctuations depend on competition. Similarly, Meituan also sees lower subsidy level post Singles Day promotions, but the ultimate performance for 4Q25E will be based on competition evolvement. Overall, we believe loss from food delivery/quick commerce investment should have peaked in 3Q25 based on both companies' comments; uncertainties remain, though, given both companies will not want to be the one that

scales back subsidy (which would benefit opponents). Hence, while we believe loss magnitude for 4Q25 and future quarters should be lower than 3Q25, it remains uncertain when Meituan/industry could return to profitability.

Syntun Data released a report estimating 2025 Double 11 GMV reached Rmb1.62trn, +12.3% YoY, or Rmb1.696trn if including Rmb67bn from quick commerce. Tmall, JD, and Douyin rank among the top 3 e-commerce platforms by GMV. There have been no comments from BABA and PDD about the actual performance on the Singles Day promotions while VIPS and JD gave positive comments on the promotions. We believe while BABA might have gained back some traction from overseas cosmetic brands and branded apparel demand, competition in white label/long tail merchants remained intense. More importantly, due to a high base from last year's trade-in program, we expect all platforms face a tough comp/high base, especially for JD and to a lesser extent BABA from appliance categories.

n VIPS stated that Oct and Nov growth was decent, and it also achieved good GMV momentum during the 11.11 promotion period, but with higher base and uncertainty on weather temperature trend. n During JD Double 11 Grand Promotion, the number of shopping customers increased by 40% year-on-year.

In Oct, China online physical sales grew by 5% yoy, vs +7.5% yoy in 3Q25. The deceleration was likely due to 1) the high base of the home appliance category benefiting from government subsidy trade-in programs last year, and the high base effect should sustain in Dec; 2) a slowly recovering economy. By category, we expect continued tough comp for home appliances in Nov and Dec while discretionary products like apparel, cosmetics and jewelry are likely to hold up relatively better in Dec. Additionally, we believe due to earlier 2025 CNY, some of the purchases might have been booked under Dec 2024 last year, which could lead to higher base for this year Dec, especially with 2026 CNY fall in mid Feb next year and hence most of the purchase will likely happen in Jan rather than Dec.

Among long video platforms, we prefer iQiyi over Mango Excellent Media as iQiyi should benefit more from the drama regulations as the leading drama producer and streaming platform, and iQiyi has started to see positive impacts from supportive regulations. Mango expects 1-2 years for audience to see more obvious impact. n iQiyi: In the two months since the policy implementation, iQiyi has observed positive progress. Some of iQiyi's projects have already benefited from the policy support, allowing them to reach a ready-to-broadcast status more quickly. As production proceeds smoothly in the future, iQiyi anticipates gradually seeing the broad benefits of the policies. n Mango Excellent Media : Regulators aim to support and improve the drama industry. There will be positive impact from the regulations on drama genres, faster review process, etc. Mango expects the audience to see material impact in the next one to two years.

n TME: Mgmt highlighted TME's competitive advantage in music library, experience in music asset mgmt and commitment in providing high quality listening experience. Comparison on mobile-only active users underestimated TME's large PC subscriber base and high penetration in in-car service and ability to leverage Tencent games and video IPs. n User metrics: MAU of Soda Music increased by 88% yoy to 127m in Oct 2025, vs Kugou Music at 211m (-8% yoy), QQ Music at 192m (-2%), Cloud Music at 149m (+1% yoy), and Kuwo Music at 109mn (-11% yoy). Average time spent per user of Soda Music was 76mins (+21% yoy), vs Kugou Music at 115 mins (-7% yoy), QQ Music at 90 mins (-15% yoy), Cloud Music at 27 mins (-6% yoy) and Kuwo Music at 112 mins (+10% yoy).

n Damai: China market should continue to grow but overall should be largely stable as music category's growth is capped by venue capacity. Overall Damai's take rate is stable in FY1H26 and we think competition impact is minimal. Damai International will invest in overseas markets and will 1) cooperate with local partners to host international artist events; 2) exploring ticketing services and participate in content production. n TME: Mgmt shared that live performances and concerts are a key commitment for the company, and they have made substantial investments in this area. TME has organized tours for top artists and have their own proprietary IPs like TMEA. The concert business not only helps build experience but also forges deeper partnerships with artists and the ecosystem. One example is the successful GDragon concert tour in Asia Pacific this past quarter.

n Maoyan: Maoyan noted that for 9M25, China music concert ticketing GMV grew at mid-single digit yoy, and Maoyan is growing faster than the industry. Generally after three years post Covid-19, the pent-up demand for music concert might decelerate and the industry will return to normal growth and expect next year's growth rate to be similar with 2025. For local entertainment performances like stand-up comedy & exhibitions, Maoyan shared that they are growing at high double digits.

Kamzhu mgmt shared that blue-collar recruitment continued to outperform white-collar with a record-high revs contribution, and transportation, logistics and service verticals outperformed within blue-collar recruitment, while AI, internet, new consumption and gaming outperformed within white-collar recruitment. Mgmt also sees persistently rising contribution from 3rd-tier cities and below with recovery on 1st tier cities and stable 2nd tier cities. With improving recruitment sentiment, we expect its mid-teens CCB growth is likely to sustain into 4Q25E.

Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk

Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months.

The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign 'Rating Suspended' status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as '-' and '-' respectively in the rating history price

chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned 'Under Review' status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may

be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
