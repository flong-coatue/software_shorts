Entering 2026, we believe positioning across AI, cloud, and consumer internet remains heavily shaped by narratives formed and lessons learned during the first phase of Gen AI, i.e., the economic shape of AI proved very different from consensus expectations. Across hyperscalers, AI cloud providers, social media platforms, e-commerce marketplaces, and on-demand services, AI increasingly behaved like capital-intensive infrastructure rather than high-margin software. This research note outlines ten key debates that we believe will define AI and internet stock performance in 2026. For each debate, we identify: (1) the prevailing consensus assumption embedded in current valuations; (2) the nonconsensus or surprise outcome that could emerge; and (3) the directional stock implications should those surprises materialize. Our objective is not to predict AI adoption, which now appears inevitable, but to highlight where expectations may be mispriced, and where outcomes could drive disproportionate stock moves relative to consensus.
