Price objective basis & risk Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Our PO of $90 is based on a 0.8x relative EV/EBITDA multiple to the defense primes, at the lower end of the 0.8x-1.4x historical range. This reflects a 11x EV/EBITDA multiple. We think a relative multiple at the lower end of the historical range fairly reflects the downward pressure from Civil exposure and delayed accelerations in Defense We think valuation will remain pressured until BAH can return to a net growth trajectory. Risks to the upside are a better-than-anticipated upturn in the federal budget, faster-than-expected normalization from post-DOGE environment, inexpensive and well-integrated M&A activity and unexpected capital return to shareholders in the form of buybacks or special dividends.

Risks to the downside are cuts to the DoD budget vs. anticipated, unfavorable timing between DOGE-related cuts and the bridge to new tech-oriented solutions. Should BAH run into any problems with integrating M&A, containing its costs or a heightened competitive environment there could be downside risk to our estimates.

Booz Allen Hamilton BAH disappoints with beat stemming below the line Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) shares rose 6.8 % (vs S&P500 flat ) the day it reported earnings, despite what we consider relatively poor quality of earnings. While adj. EPS beat expectations, this was primarily driven below the operating line with a tax benefit of $13mn vs. BofAe tax expense of $46mn . Overall revenues missed expectations, with BAH ' s NatSec portfolio (comprised of its Defense and Intelligence work) surprising to the downside. We see challenges ahead in BAH meeting its FY26 ou tlook, with downside to FY27 consensus numbers. We do appreciate better margins and cost-cutting actions than expected, but it may imply less room to react in the case of a sudden award acceleration. We reiterate our Underperform and maintain our PO of $90 . See p ages 3 - 4 for explanation of EPS changes. Is this really the bottom for Civil? As expected, Civil revenues fell 28% Y/Y .

The question remains, is this the bottom for Civil or is there more downside to come? We are expecting FY26 Civil revenue to be down 21 % Y/Y, followed by a 10 % Y/Y decrease in FY27. A significant portion of the work in BAH ' s Civil business is related to Health and Veterans Affairs. Management noted that spending priorities have somewhat shifted to Homeland Security, the FAA, and readiness initiatives. We could continue to see pressure at Civil i f BAH is unable to be agile and adapt to these changing priorities. FY26 outlook implies step up in Defense & Intel

While the decline in Civil revenues was expected, we were disappointed to see NatSec portfolio revenue decrease Y/Y as well, driven by Intelligence. Even accounting for a seasonal uptick in Civil in the fourth quarter, BAH FY26 outlook implies high-single digit revenue increase Y/Y in NatSec in 4Q (with a couple of points explained by deferred billables due to the shutdown). Management pointed to the double-digit pipeline of opportunities for both Civil and NatSec as enabling this growth, but the Y/Y decrease in funded backlog and staff headcount may cause challenges.

Booz Allen Hamilton Decoupling of backlog, headcount, and expected revenue As highlighted, funded backlog decreased 21 % Y/Y (and was down 23 % sequentially). We note a recent decoupling between BAH ' s TTM backlog , headcount, and next-six-month revenue. In our view, even if there is double digit growth in the pipeline, it could take until mid-2027 for BAH to actually execute on that growth. We see downside to FY27 consensus numbers. Exhibit 1 : We see downside to FY27 consensus numbers with soft leading indicators TTM backlog, headcount, BofA Next 2Q revenue, BBG Consensus Source: BofA Global Research estimates , company filings BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Productizing Vellox Reverser for comm'l customers BAH highlighted its Vellox Reverser, an AI-enabled reverse engineering solution. BAH has productized its IP for commercial sales and is launching Vellox Reverser in general availability to both federal and commercial customers.

We previously discussed the Vellox Reverser after seeing it at AUSA ( read our AUSA 2025 report here ). Treasury Dept. cancels all contracts with BAH On the Monday following BAH ' s 3QFY26 report, it was announced that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cancelled the Treasury Department ' s contracts with BAH after one of BAH ' s employees leaked President Trump ' s tax record to the Times. According to the Treasury Department, the Department has 31 separate contracts with BAH totaling $4.8mn in annual spending and $21mn in total obligations. Reiterate Underperform, maintain PO at $90 We re it erate our Underperform on Booz Allen Hamilton. We roll forward our valuation to C Y27 E . Our PO of $90 is based on a 0.8x relative EV/EBITDA multiple to the defense primes, at the lower end of the 0.8x-1.4x historical range (unchanged) . This reflects a 1 1 x EV/EBITDA multiple (vs. 12x prior on CY26)

. We think a relative multiple at the lower end of the historical range fairly reflects the downward pressure from Civil exposure and delayed accelerations in Defense We think valuation will remain pressured until BAH can return to a net growth trajectory. Raising adj. EPS to account for tax benefit We raise our adj. EPS estimates in FY26 to account for the tax benefit seen in 3QFY26. We are now expecting FY26 adj. EPS of $6.05 (vs. $5.60 prior). We delay our growth expectations in Defense & Intelligence, partially offset by stronger Civil growth. As a result, we are now expecting slower topline growth in the outyears. In FY28 we expect adj. EPS of $6.05 (vs. $5.60 prior) and in FY28 we e xp ect adj. EPS of $6.90 (vs. $6.65 prior).

BAH continues to face mounting challenges in its Civilian exposure, which makes up 1/3 of revenues. While we continue to see BAH strongly positioned across the National Security portfolio, leveraging a strong mix of technical expertise and mission intimacy to operationalize AI, 5G/6G, cloud, cyber, and zero trust solutions. However, we do not expect this to be enough to offset growing pressure from civil or propel growth in the near term.
