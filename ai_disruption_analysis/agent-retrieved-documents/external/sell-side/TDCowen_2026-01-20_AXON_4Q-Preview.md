We expect bookings growth of ~50%, implied by FY guide of high 30s. We expect FY26 rev growth guide in line w/ Street of 25% & EBITDA margin guide of ~25%. We scoured through ~100 cities & found some solid 4Q deals & strong new product traction (AI, Drones, RTCC). We expect strong new 3-year rev/margin guides, & we rolled out '28 ests. Reiterate Top Pick. ■ AXON is coming off a noisy 3Q (LINK) with a smaller than normal revenue beat & raise but a very bullish tone & reiteration of FY bookings guide. For 4Q, we expect strong bookings growth of ~50%, implied by mgmt's FY guide of high 30s. We model total revenue of $754m (+31% Y/Y), in line w/ guide & expect a slight beat (4Q typically beats by less as it is the only qtr guided).

■ On FY26, we expect guidance at least in line w/ Street of 25%, which we think is conservative given FY25 bookings growth of high 30s. AXON's initial FY25 guide was +25% and will likely end up doing +32%. We expect EBITDA margin guide of ~25%, in line w/ our new est (lowered by 50bps) to reflect added opex from Prepared & Carbyne. Mgmt will also update its 3-year growth & margin targets: we think a revenue growth CAGR ('25-'28) of ~25% & EBITDA margins of ~28% are reasonable, in line w/ our new '28 estimates. We think these targets should be well received by investors as this should quell any concerns that growth is slowing or margins have limited upside. We raised our FY26 Devices growth from 17% to 20%, now in line w/ Street.

■ We analyzed the Major Cities Chiefs Association member agencies, plus additional agencies, for ~100 total city databases to find AXON deals. While this is far from an exhaustive list given AXON's 17k+ U.S. customers, it includes the largest agencies, & we found some interesting 4Q deals. 1) Dallas approved a large $268m 10-yr deal (up from $147m prior), upgrading from OSP 7+ to OSP 10 Premium & increasing licenses, adding city security officers, DFR, AI Era, Dedrone, Fusus, & more; 2) Miami-Dade Corrections upgraded to T10 ($4.4m 10-yr); 3) Omaha continued its DFR expansion; 4) Denver Police, Sheriff, & Fire Depts approved a $27m 5-yr deal; 5) Chula Vista approved AI Era & Fusus. Our net takeaway is this gives us greater confidence in 4Q bookings, AXON's durable competitive advantages, & strong cross-sell of new products AI Era, Drones, & Fusus. We outline some other deals

w/ smaller agencies on pg 3. ■ Shares are up >20% off the 11/20 bottom & ~10% below pre-3Q print. Trading at ~12x EV/ CY27E Sales, multiples are still well below mid/high-teens range of 1H25. AXON remains our Best Idea for 2026 (LINK) & we think deserves a healthy premium to comps given its highly durable end markets, high growth profile, AI product cycle, little competition, & high moat. Reiterate Buy & $925 PT (~18x EV/CY27E Sales).

Our thesis is 1) public safety is a large and stable TAM; 2) TASER 10 and Axon Body 4 product cycles are strong growth drivers; 3) our customer checks were very bullish; 4) AXON has several strong growth drivers including up-selling the OSP bundle, new US markets, and International; 5) AXON deserves a premium valuation, and this should prove sustainable.

■ Knoxville (TN, population ~200k) approved a $37m 10-year deal in January that included RTCC/Fusus, Drones, & LPRs, plus expansions of BWCs, Fleet, and TASER 10. This was an expansion from its $27.6m 10-year deal signed a year ago.

■ Chula Vista (CA, population ~275k) approved Fusus in early January 2026 (Real-Time Crime Center or RTCC) for $135k/year, replacing MSI's Command Central Aware, and will integrate existing tech including city-owned cameras, drone feeds, license plate readers, BWCs, officer GPS locations, & its CAD system. This follows the city's approval in late Sept for the AI Era plan for $268k/year. From the meeting slide deck, officer feedback was very bullish, including "I can confidently say that this tool is absolutely amazing and has completely transformed the way I approach report writing. The efficiency and time savings it offers are unparalleled. During the beta phase, I consistently found myself completing my reports hours faster than my colleagues - something that not only enhances my productivity but also allows me to spend more time focused on fieldwork and other important tasks."

■ Reedley (CA) approved a new deal for $1.2m over 10 years and, in addition to TASER & BWC updates, added the Axon Sky Hero Drone System and AI products including BWC RealTime Translation, Draft One, & AI Evidence Mgmt enhancements (automated video tagging, improved search features, streamlined digital discovery for prosecutors, enhanced workflow for detectives & records staff).

- ■ AXON currently trades at ~16.5x EV/NTM Sales, ~17% below its 1-year median of ~19.9x.

- ■ Our sales headcount analysis shows that AXON sales headcount increased +23% Y/Y and +9% over the last 6 months to a total of 585 sales-related employees. Because of recent restatements by LinkedIn, we do not have clean Q/Q comparisons.

NASDAQ: AXON ESG Score: 49/100 ESG Industry Percentile: 15 th

Establishing materiality is critical to evaluating a company's ESG performance. Factors most material in one sector (or to a particular company) may not be as important to another. In addition, the factors that are material - and the degree to which factors are material - can change over time. Applying data to frameworks established by SASB (the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and by FactSet, we present in the chart above the three most material ESG factors that investors should focus on for the company that is the subject of this report; the Dynamic Materiality™ of each factor (i.e., what percentage of overall materiality the category represents for the subject company); and a Score for the subject company in each of these three categories (on a 0 to 100 basis, with 50 being average). We also calculate an overall ESG Score for the subject company, which is presented above (in green) and on the cover of this report. A full explanation of how this ESG Score is derived is presented below.

200,000+ SOURCES 4,500,000+ DATA POINTS 300,000 SIGNALS SCREENED BY ESG FRAMEWORK processed per month generated monthly TD Cowen leverages technology from FactSet to generate our ESG scores. Truvalue uses artificial intelligence to capture the stakeholder view of how companies are performing on ESG metrics, using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) materiality framework (www.sasb.org). These data are leveraged to calculate a score for each company, which allows TD Cowen to have a common framework and uniform way to approach ESG discussions with our clients. TD Cowen ESG scores appear on Company and Company Quick Take notes and are updated daily.

The process begins with capturing unstructured data from more than 200,000 sources, in 38 languages. These data are culled from a wide range of sources with varied perspectives, including industry publications, news outlets, NGOs, trade unions, government sources, legal and regulatory filings, and academic publications. Natural language processing is used to interpret semantic content from the original sources and generate analytics by applying criteria consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks. Performance is scored on a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate more positive ESG performance, and scores below reflect more negative ESG performance. A score of NA means not enough data is available on the company to generate a score.

Our valuation methodology is primarily based on Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow (EV/FCF), followed by Price-to-Earnings (P/E). However, this varies by company; for instance, we will often use Enterprise Value to Revenue (EV/Revs) or a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis for software companies that are primarily subscriptions-based, or for growth companies that have recently entered the public equity markets. We make investment recommendations on certain early stage, pre-revenue companies based upon an assessment of their business model, technology, probability of market success, and the potential market opportunity, balanced by an assessment of applicable risks. Such companies may not be assigned a price target.

The global economy or specific end markets significantly worsen, contracting IT spending and impairing software growth. The rate of SaaS/Cloud adoption slows, resulting in prolonged sales cycles and higher-than-anticipated quarterly volatility across much of our coverage universe. Competition increases materially, driving deflationary pricing pressure and compressing margins. In particular, innovation by new entrants in the software sector often produces solutions with similar or better functionality at materially lower prices than incumbents' legacy offerings.

1) Shares trade at a premium valuation, creating high expectations; 2) RPO & bookings can fluctuate due to the timing & execution of large deals; 3) the product cycles of TASER 10, Axon Body 4, & the AI Era Bundle could see slower adoption than we expect; 4) expansion into newer markets could be slower than we expect; 5) margin expansion could be less than we forecast.
