Price objective basis & risk DSV (DSDVF / DSDVY) Our PO (based on a multiple analysis) of DKK2,200 per share (ADR price $175) assumes a 25.0x P/E multiple on 2027E on our estimates. Our target multiple is above its 10-year historical average of 23.5x which we think is fair given growth expectations. Upside risks are a stronger-than-expected macroeconomic recovery resulting in higher volumes, stronger-than-expected air and sea yields, further shareholder returns, greater-than-expected cost cuts and synergies from Schenker acquisition. Downside risks are weaker-than-expected macroeconomic recovery resulting in lower volumes, yield pressure from de-globalization and competition from digital forwarders, lower-than-expected cost cuts and synergies from Schenker acquisition.

DSV Potential cost-savings outshine soft 2026 guide Shares have rebounded intra-day as 2026 guidance disappointment made way for optimism over incremental cost savings from technology advancements during the earnings call . 4 Q EBIT of DKK5,592m was in-line with consensus as weaker Air & Sea yields were offset by better-than-expected Road and Contract Logistics. DSV accelerated its Schenker acquisition timeline and now expects full synergies by 2027 (from 2028 before ) . The 2026 EBIT guidance of DKK 23-25.5bn is -3% below consensus at the mid-point . We lower our 2026E EBIT estimate by 2% to DKK 24.2 bn to reflect lower Air & Sea gross profit , while 2027E increases by 3% to reflect synergy phasing. This drives our PO (based on 202 7 E EPS) to DKK 2,200 (ADR to $ 175 ). S hares trade on 2 0 x 202 7 E P/E, well below the 1yr fwd LT avg. of 23.5 x, whic h

we believe is unjustified given earnings growth from additional cost savings . DSV is one of our " 25 stocks for 2026 " and on our Europe 1 list ( see Bumper AI & Synergies upside ) . Reiterate Buy S ynergy timeline accelerates, big cost saving potential DSV reaffirmed its DKK9bn synergy target and accelerated the integration benefit to be fully realized in 2027. Customer churn has remained low with all large customers relationships intact . During the earnings call , management highlighted " billions " of incremental cost-savings from AI and technology , reinforcing our view of DSV as a potential AI adoption winner (see What's the potential AI benefit? ). The CEO said they will likely combine " phase 2 synergies " and AI benefits in one cost savings bucket with details at its 12 May CMD. The company has not confirmed its decision on CargoWise but stated its " very likely " to move towards an internal solution. 2026 outlook: Upside to Air yields; Ocean challenging Air yields fell - 7 %

q/q in 4Q with a negative one-off impact from Schenker contracts and DSV expects DKK8000 levels in 2026 . Ocean yields suffered from Schenker dilution and lower freight rates , and DSV targets to keep yields flat at DKK3800 in 2026 as market weakness is offset by improving Schenker yields . The 2026 guidance assumes Air & Sea markets to grow 2-3% in line with GDP. We model 2026 underlying Sea/Air volumes at flat / +1 % y/y and yields at DKK3800/7900 .

DSV Action-packed results Cost-savings front-and-centre DSV highlighted the potential for incremental cost-savings above the DKK9bn synergy guide from the Schenker acquisition. Management highlighted ' phase two ' , which suggested that cost-synergies and technology advancements could save " billions ' for the company. We continue to believe DSV can upgrade integration synergies based on low customer churn , transitioning away from CargoWise and improving legacy Schenker yields by incorporating more value-added services. Additionally, we believe DSV can be an ' AI winner ' with AI advancements capable of stripping vast amounts of cost out of its largest cost bucket - labour (see What's the potential AI benefit? ). DSV will outline its technology ambitions and associated cost benefits at its CMD in May. Weaker guide reflects challenging underlying markets Shares initially weakened after the results, as the 2026 EBIT guide of DKK 23-25.5bn -

with a midpoint roughly -3% below the DKK 25bn consensus - fell short of market expectations. The outlook incorporates a DKK500m FX headwind from a weaker USD and reflects continued uncertainty in Air & Ocean, with no assumptions around a Red Sea reopening. DSV expects 2026 Air & Sea markets to grow 2 - 3% in line with GDP, with Air yields rising mid ‑ single ‑ digit to around DKK 8,000 and Sea yields remaining flat at DKK 3,800. Road is expected to improve gradually with flat to low ‑ single ‑ digit growth, while Contract Logistics should grow low ‑ to mid ‑ single ‑ digit. The Schenker acquisition has temporarily elevated the tax rate, with 2026 guided at 28%. Capital allocation policy could see 2H26 buyback and FY27 acquisitions DSV reduced net debt by DKK 2bn in 4Q and DKK 7bn over 2025, bringing gearing down to 2.8x and closer to its 2x target. Strong cash ‑

flow generation combined with solid progress on the Schenker integration puts the company in a strong position to resume buybacks in 2026. This is further supported by potential sale of Schenker ' s real ‑ estate portfolio of € 1.5 - 2.0bn. Additionally, management flagged future deal-making, stating that " we would hope there would be a deal in 2027 " Road & Contact Logistics offset A&S weakness in 4Q Road and Contract Logistics delivered a solid 4Q despite a soft European backdrop. 4Q Road EBIT of DKK1,009m was a +15%/+9% beat vs. consensus/BofA. Road benefited from the scale added through Schenker, lifting revenue and gross profit roughly 1.5x, with margins expected to trend higher as conversion improves and integration progresses, though Germany remains the toughest market. Contract Logistics posted solid results, with 4Q EBIT of DKK1,514m c10% ahead of consensus supported by economies of scale and cost control . Key takeaways from the conference call: Management highlighted substantial cost ‑ reduction potential from AI, noting it is

" very likely " DSV will ultimately adopt an internal system rather than CargoWise, with further detail to come at CMD. DSV targets to transform the business and organize it on the enterprise level. The company believes these changes are difficult to execute and others will be reluctant to implement. DSV wants " to be the problem for everybody". The DKK 9bn synergy target was reaffirmed, though management sees " significant " additional upside - potentially measured in billions - driven largely by technology. Management cautioned against extrapolating the weak 4Q Air performance, which was mainly tied to legacy Schenker contracts . The guidance has DKK 500m FX headwind already embedded in the outlook. DSV reiterated its double ‑ digit margin ambitions for Road, aiming to lift returns on capital as market conditions improve, with more to be shared at CMD. Guidance assumes current Red Sea disruptions persist, with the net impact uncertain as higher complexity may lift value added services , but potentially be offset by lower freight rates.

DSV has become the largest global freight forwarder following the acquisition of DB Schenker. Our comparative analysis shows DSV has the highest margins amongst its peers and we think the company can partially offset the decline in yields with lower costs. DSV has a strong track record of M&A over the past decade, and we forecast strong EPS accretion from the Schenker acquisition.
