We believe the impact from AI will be a major theme in Business & Information Services in 2026, with some companies - particularly those in the Info Services sub-sector - poised to bene fi t from AI-led product innovation that fuels product upsell, accelerated pricing increases, stronger retention rates and increased new business wins. Names in our sector that we think are best positioned with respect to AI include FICO, MCO, MSCI, SPGI, TRI and VRSK given they have proprietary data, entrenched work fl ows, scale and brand advantages, and/or a regulatory moat, with su ffi cient investments in AI capabilities to be competitive. Names that we believe face disintermediation risk from AI include FDS, HRB and RHI given they lack su ffi cient proprietary data, have labor-based business models that can be automated, or generate revenue from lower tier white collar sta ffi ng. Additional themes that we expect for the year ahead include healthy debt issuance growth, rapid expansion in private credit and private market data demand, improving

buy-side and sell-side budgets, and solid consumer credit trends. We believe top performers in 2026 within Business & Info Services will have a combination of strong positioning with respect to AI, defensive characteristics, pricing power and/or secular tailwinds; these include Buy-rated BFAM, FICO, IRM, SPGI and TRI. Among our Sell ratings, we are particularly cautious on FDS, HRB and RHI on AI disruption and competitive headwinds that will likely pressure earnings and valuation multiples.

The Business & Information Services sector declined an average of 10.7% in 2025 , while the S&P 500 increased 16.4%, with Information Services down 15.1% and Business Services down 7.4%. The Info Services sub-sector experienced particular pressure during the middle of the year due to concerns around competitive threats from AI . FDS and IT led the declines in Info Services, spurred by debates on whether their product o ff erings could be replicated by AI, with decelerating organic revenue growth fueling those debates. That said, some of the worst performers in

2025 were in the Business Services sub-sector, re fl ecting macro pressures and execution issues. In a departure from typical years, Business Services companies with defensive characteristics and idiosyncratic turnaround stories led stock price outperformance in 2025 . Notable outperformers included: ULS, due to defensive growth and secular tailwinds from industrial automation and the electri fi cation of everything; PBI, given idiosyncratic initiatives to improve pro fi tability and shareholder returns, including the sale of its ecommerce business; and ROL, re fl ecting the resilient and defensive nature of pest control. KLC underperformed given enrollment headwinds from macro uncertainty and exposure to low-tier consumers, as did RHI due to reduced white collar hiring volumes and VSTS due to market share loss from customer service quality and sales force execution issues. Stock picking was key in Business & Info Services last year, as demonstrated by the dispersion of returns owing to the sensitivity of business models to AI risks as well as

idiosyncratic catalysts at the company level. We believe stock picking will remain important in 2026.

Looking ahead to 2026, we have a positive outlook for organic revenue growth in the Info Services sector , with Business Services growth likely to be more muted. Within our coverage sector of 30 stocks, we expect average organic revenue growth to be 7.6% in Info Services and 3.5% in Business Services. We believe organic revenue growth in Info Services in 2026 will be strongest at FICO, CSGP, MCO, MSCI and TRI. These names have a combination of pricing power, secular tailwinds, proprietary data and leverage to AI . As in past years, we believe organic revenue growth will take a front seat over margins in determining valuation multiples in Info Services given revenues better capture a company's value proposition with customers, competitive positioning and, ultimately, its terminal value. Within Business Services, we expect organic revenue growth in 2026 to be strongest at IRM, BFAM, CTAS, ROL and ULS, re fl ecting scale advantages, defensive growth and market share gains. Our top

picks for 2026, which we discuss in more detail below, all have healthy organic revenue growth landing in the top half of our sector coverage. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We expect Business & Info Services companies to see attractive EBITDA margin expansion in 2026 driven by e ffi ciency gains and operating leverage. We forecast Info Services average EBITDA margins to be a healthy 42.1% in 2026, twice that of Business Services at 21.6%, due to low human capital intensity and operating leverage from a 'build once, sell many times' business model. Relative to 2025, we expect average EBITDA margins to expand 90 bps in Info Services and 60 bps in Business Services in 2026. We expect savings across the sector arising from AI-driven e ffi ciencies, increased automation and operating leverage. At the top end of our 2026 EBITDA margin expectations are MSCI, FICO, VRSK, MCO and SPGI in Info Services and ADT, IRM, PBI, CTAS and HRB in Business Services. Our top picks for 2026 re fl ect companies delivering on average 80 bps of EBITDA margin

expansion this year. Exhibit 3: Info Services EBITDA margins should come in twice that of Business Services in CY2026E CY2026E EBITDA margins Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Within the Business & Info Services sector, EPS generally outperformed FactSet consensus expectations across the 1Q, 2Q and 3Q 2025 earnings cycles, helped by revenue outperformance and cost optimization initiatives. The median EPS upside was 7.4% in 1Q, 5.2% in 2Q and 3.6% in 3Q. Revenue also surprised to the upside relative to consensus over the course of 2025, with companies beating by 0.8% in 1Q, 1.1% in 2Q and 0.9% in 3Q at the median. 4Q results for the sector will begin to be announced the last week of January, beginning with MSCI and MAN. Companies with consistent revenue outperformance vs consensus over the course of last year included CLVT, CSGP, CTAS, EFX, FDS, HRB, KFY, MAN, MCO, MH, ROL, SPGI and TRU due to idiosyncratic initiatives, pricing power, share gains,

unvended market penetration and/or secular tailwinds. We note that CY2026 FactSet consensus EPS estimates were revised lower by an average of 7.8% over the course of 2025, pointing to more conservative and potentially de-risked expectations as we enter 2026. The largest positive 2026 EPS estimate revisions were seen at MH due to healthy market share trends in K-12 and higher education, PBI re fl ecting cost-cutting initiatives, FICO given planned 100% pricing increases for mortgage scores, ULS due to strong Industrial growth lifted by industrial automation and electri fi cation, and MCO re fl ecting healthy debt issuance trends. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the largest negative 2026 EPS estimates revisions occurred at VSTS owing to market share losses linked to mixed customer service quality and sales execution, RHI and MAN given constrained hiring volumes in the US and Europe, KLC

due to enrollment declines, and EFX re fl ecting white collar hiring declines weighing on background screening volumes in EWS Talent Solutions and higher opex. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

- Evidence of AI monetization or AI disruption in both the Info Services and n Business Services sub-sectors, with 2026 likely being a key adoption year of AI by enterprises. Based on fi ndings from our 2nd annual Silicon Valley AI Field Trip, companies with a sustainable moat vs AI have proprietary data, entrenched work fl ows, scale and brand advantages, and/or a regulatory moat, with su ffi cient investments in AI capabilities to be competitive. Companies that we believe have the strongest AI positioning based on these criteria include FICO, MCO, MSCI, SPGI, TRI and VRSK. We expect companies with revenues favorably leveraged to AI to begin to increasingly monetize their AI functionalities, in the form of product upgrade cycles, accelerated pricing increases, increased cross-sell, stronger retention rates and 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

greater new business wins. Companies that we believe have the weakest AI positioning based on the criteria above include FDS, HRB and RHI. In these cases, we believe lack of su ffi cient proprietary data, or exposure to sta ffi ng headwinds as lower tier white collar jobs are automated, will pressure revenue performance.

Defensive names remaining in favor given ongoing macro uncertainty, geopolitical n volatility and technology disruptions in the economy. Companies with the strongest defensive characteristics, in our view, provide essential services and have strong pricing power, recurring revenue streams and secular tailwinds. These names include ADT, BCO, CTAS, FICO, IRM, ROL, TRI, ULS and VRSK. Global debt issuance increasing solid-mid-single digits in 2026 , bene fi ting the n rating agencies, driven by a strong corporate re fi nancing pipeline totaling $5tn+ across the US and EMEA over the next four years, a rebound in M&A volumes and declining interest rates. Based on our analysis of data over the past 20 years, every 100 bps of US policy rate cut adds ~15% to corporate debt issuance growth.

Robust growth in private markets , lifting revenues at the rating agencies and MSCI, n fueled by private credit and demand for private markets data. Private credit AUM has grown at a robust 16% 5-year CAGR, while private credit-related ratings revenue has been increasing 60%+ annually, demonstrating rising ratings penetration of the private credit market. Meanwhile, demand for private markets data is rising to support private investments, with MCO's Orbis database and recent deals such as SPGI's acquisition of With Intelligence in November 2025 and MSCI's acquisition of Burgiss in October 2023 bolstering private market capabilities.

Strengthening trends among buy-side and sell-side fi rms leveraged to improving n active manager fund fl ows, market appreciation and ongoing new fund formation, in addition to greater capital markets activity and M&A volumes. This serves as a tailwind for SPGI, MCO, MSCI and FDS, though share loss at FDS will likely o ff set the bene fi t.

Stable-to-improving consumer credit conditions, driven by relatively low n unemployment and positive real wage growth. Credit delinquency rates under these conditions should improve, supporting ongoing low-to-mid single-digit growth in card, personal loan and auto originations, though we are watching for signs of low-tier consumer strain with subprime personal loan delinquencies trending up y/y in recent months. We expect mortgage origination growth to accelerate as mortgage rates come down, noting mortgage unit volumes remain ~50% below pre-COVID levels. Improving consumer credit conditions serve as a tailwind for EFX, TRU and FICO.

US government actions impacting select Business Services companies , such as n fraud prevention initiatives in child care services, for-pro fi t higher education and social services having negative implications for KLC and PXED due to reduced funding and company steps to deter fraudulent enrollments, and positive implications for EFX due to greater demand for income veri fi cation. IRM stands to bene fi t this year from the US Department of Treasury's digital modernization initiative, while IT should see a lapping impact from reduced federal government spend in 2025. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Ongoing declines in US temp sta ffi ng revenue through at least the fi rst half of the n year due to white collar labor disruptions from AI. With instances of hiring freezes and corporate downsizing, we expect demand for labor to soften and the supply of labor to increase, putting downward pressure on temp penetration rates. We view RHI as most negatively exposed given its mix of bookkeeping, admin and customer support temp sta ffi ng. Pricing increases a tailwind for revenue growth among companies with a wide n competitive moat, monopolistic market structure and strong product value proposition. We expect CSGP, CTAS, FICO, IRM, MCO, MSCI, ROL, SPGI and TRI to realize particularly healthy pricing increases in 2026. AI product upsell should selectively accelerate pricing increases in Info Services.

Ongoing e ff orts to optimize costs and drive e ffi ciencies including managing n headcount growth, lowering T&E spend, reducing facilities costs, upgrading the tech stack and migrating to the cloud.

The Business & Info Services sector trades at an average 20.9x CY2026E P/E multiple, with the Info Services sub-sector averaging 25.0x, which represents a premium to the Business Services sub-sector at 17.8x due to the former's superior organic revenue growth and EBITDA margin characteristics. We value Info Services companies primarily on an NTM P/E basis given their capital-light business models and typically unlevered balance sheets ; we value Business Services names primarily on an NTM EV/EBITDA basis given they are more capital intensive in incur more D&A expense. At 47.8x CY2026E P/E, CSGP trades at the highest multiple in Info Services given the company's temporary period of under-earning from elevated residential investments. At the opposite end of the spectrum is CLVT, which has a 4.7x CY2026E P/E multiple due to slow progress with its turnaround in organic revenue growth. The

Info Services average NTM P/E multiple has de-rated from approximately 35x at the beginning of 2025 to 25x currently, primarily on AI concerns, creating buying opportunities in companies with a wide competitive moat vs AI that de-rated with the broader sector. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Multiples as of 1/13/26, based on GS estimates Source: FactSet, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Business & Info Services companies currently trade at an average CY2026E EV/EBITDA multiple of 13.5x, with the Info Services sub-sector averaging 17.7x and the Business Services sub-sector averaging 10.3x. Most Business & Info Services companies commanding high EBITDA multiples - such as CSGP, ROL, FICO, MSCI, CTAS and MCO have strong organic revenue growth pro fi les supporting their valuations. KLC has the lowest CY2026 EV/EBITDA multiple due to child care center occupancy rate declines, while PXED's low multiple re fl ects enrollment growth deceleration due to actions to combat fraud and MAN's depressed valuation is attributable to reduced hiring volumes in Europe and North America.

As we look ahead to 2026, we believe top performers within Business & Info Services will have a combination of strong positioning with respect to AI, defensiveness, pricing power and secular tailwinds. We highlight Buy-rated BFAM, FICO, IRM, SPGI and TRI - all of which possess the characteristics of being long-term compounders . BFAM is defensive in an uncertain macro environment, is generating an ongoing recovery in child care enrollment trends toward pre-COVID levels with high incremental margins, and bene fi ts from a high-growth and high-margin back-up care business. FICO's strong pricing power in its Scores business also confers economic resilience and a robust EPS growth outlook, with a wide AI moat. IRM enjoys defensiveness and stability in its record storage business with healthy pricing power, while also being leveraged to secular tailwinds in its data center, asset lifecycle management and digital solutions businesses.

is favorably leveraged to a healthy debt issuance outlook, diversi fi ed growth across its non-Ratings businesses and strong positioning with respect to AI. Finally, TRI is bene fi ting from a product upgrade cycle and higher price realization from AI-enabled product launches, which should drive revenue growth acceleration in 2026. Among our Sell ratings, we are particularly cautious on FDS, HRB and RHI on AI disruption and competitive headwinds that could drive downward pressure on earnings and valuation multiples. All three names have unfavorable AI positioning, in our view, that will drive muted revenue performance in 2026 and challenge terminal values. In the section below, we highlight the theses and catalysts for these fi ve Buy ideas and three Sell ideas for 2026, followed by a discussion of the remaining names in our broader Business & Info Services coverage sector.

Bright Horizons (BFAM, Buy-rated, $130 12M PT, $6bn market cap) : Bright Horizons continues to generate improving child care center occupancy rates, which reached the mid-60s in 3Q (from low-60s in the year-ago period) and compare with 70%+ pre-COVID. Importantly, the company's back-up care business, which generates ~30% of revenue but ~75% of operating pro fi t, is delivering ~25% y/y growth, extending a long history of strong double-digit growth that often surpassed guidance. BFAM's back-up care business is being driven by rising utilization rates among existing clients and the onboarding of new clients, with growth meaningfully stepping up since COVID. Management has committed to investing in back-up care to expand capacity and increase utilization, noting this is a long-term strategic growth opportunity that remains in its early stages. We believe an ongoing recovery in child care center occupancy rates, coupled with sustained double-digit growth in back-up care with high incremental margins, will drive attractive upside in

BFAM shares. Fair Isaac (FICO, Buy-rated, $2,070 12M PT, $39bn market cap): Fair Isaac is continuing to generate robust Scores revenue growth lifted by strong mortgage score pricing increases. Looking ahead to F2026, we expect mortgage score pricing to accelerate from ~40% in F2025 to ~100% over the course of the year, noting mortgage revenue makes up ~40% of overall Scores revenue. FICO is well along in its discussions with mortgage score resellers to distribute its FICO scores directly in 2026, which is key to unlocking accelerated pricing increases as this new distribution mechanism bypasses 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

the credit bureaus and transfers the economics to FICO. We believe that once a reseller signs on to the program (with fi ve resellers capturing 90% market share), others will follow suit for competitive reasons. Further, calculation of the scores is operationally easy for the resellers, lowering implementation hurdles. Meanwhile, we expect FICO's Software platform ARR to accelerate from mid-teens currently to ~30% over the next 4-6 quarters. As in prior periods, FICO speci fi ed that its F2026 guidance is conservative, even more so this year than in the past, and we expect the company to beat-and-raise over the course of the upcoming year. The company closed out F2025 with 26% EPS growth, and we expect that to accelerate to ~30% in F2026 and remain 20%+ in F2027/2028, driving attractive upside in the shares.

Iron Mountain (IRM, Buy-rated, $127 12M PT, $27bn market cap): Iron Mountain is generating robust organic revenue growth, which accelerated to 10% y/y in 3Q from 9% in 2Q, driven by pricing power in its legacy records information management business and strong growth across data centers, asset lifecycle management and digital solutions, which collectively comprise nearly 30% of total revenue. IRM is seeing positive momentum in its data center business, with revenue growth accelerating to 32% y/y in 3Q from 26% in 2Q and leasing activity rising in 2H compared to 1H. ALM is also delivering double-digit growth led by volumes in the context of enterprise cross-sell and hyperscaler server decommissioning work, with rising memory and semiconductor component prices a strong tailwind. Of note, IRM was awarded a $715mn 5-year contract by the US Treasury Dept in its digital solutions business, which we expect to accelerate organic revenue growth and lift estimates. We believe broad-based growth drivers across IRM's growth

portfolio, combined with sustained mid-single-digit pricing increases in the legacy storage business with fl at-to-up volumes, will drive attractive organic revenue growth and valuation upside.

S&P Global (SPGI, Buy-rated, $638 12M PT, $165bn market cap): We believe S&P is favorably leveraged to secular and cyclical tailwinds in debt issuance, as well as positive underlying trends in its diversi fi ed non-Ratings businesses, including Market Intelligence, Indices and Commodity Insights. SPGI's Ratings revenue growth accelerated to low-double digits in 3Q on strong high yield and structured issuance, and we expect positive momentum to continue over the near-term. Notably, Market Intelligence organic revenue growth recently accelerated from 6% y/y in 3Q to 7.5% in 4Q, reducing concerns over a slowdown in client spending and competitive pressures. SPGI is also optimizing its portfolio, with actions in MI largely complete, including the pending $1.8bn acquisition of private markets data provider With Intelligence, completed sale of OSTTRA, and planned divestitures of EDM and thinkFolio. Indices is sustaining robust double-digit growth on market appreciation and positive fund fl

ows, while Commodity Insights is poised to reaccelerate to high-single-digit growth in 2026 once headwinds from consolidation and reduced discretionary spend lap. The company's recent investor day points to sustained 7-9% overall organic revenue growth over the medium-term with 50-75 bps of annual operating margin expansion. Per the company, the Mobility spin-o ff is also on track to be completed in the next 12 months. SPGI is focused on product innovation incorporating AI functionalities, which we expect to drive further growth acceleration across the business over time. We believe Ratings strength, diversi fi ed non-Ratings growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, margin expansion from cost e ffi ciencies and upward consensus estimate revisions will drive attractive upside in the shares. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We believe TRI's positioning with AI has signi fi cantly strengthened in recent quarters, driving robust and accelerating high-single-digit organic revenue growth in its Big 3 segments. The mix of annualized contract value from Gen AI-enabled products at TRI reached 24% in 3Q 2025, up from 15% in 3Q 2024, driven by signi fi cant product innovation involving Gen AI and agentic AI, as well as e ff ective monetization of these products. We view the company's recent launches of Westlaw Advantage and CoCounsel Legal, as well as Ready to Review and Ready to Advise in Tax & Accounting, to name a few, as drivers of product upgrade cycles and accelerating pricing increases over the next several years. Of note, the broader Info Services sector has de-rated from an average of 34x NTM P/E in late-July 2025 to 25x currently on AI concerns, with TRI's multiple

compressing from 49x to 29x despite accelerating organic revenue growth, quarterly outperformance on revenue and EPS, and upward revisions to management's outlook medium-term outlook since its 2024 investor day. We believe TRI's sustainable competitive moat in AI backed by proprietary data, editorial expertise and integrated work fl ows, as well as accelerating organic revenue growth, will drive multiple expansion and attractive upside in the shares.

FactSet (FDS, Sell-rated, $253 12M PT, $11bn market cap): FactSet's F2026 guidance implies organic ASV growth of 5.2% at the midpoint, decelerating from 5.7% growth in F2025, as well as F2026 revenue growth of 4.9% that points to deceleration from 5.4% in F2025. The company is also seeing margin pressure from investments in technology and sales infrastructure, and these investments represent an ongoing commitment rather than a temporary initiative. These investments are not being o ff set by e ffi ciency gains or price realization, leading to operating margin contraction of ~150 bps in F2026 based on guidance. While FDS' new CEO has provided strategic initiatives around commercialization, productivity and long-term growth, management did not specify medium-term fi nancial targets that ground these initiatives, resulting in limited fi nancial visibility or clarity into how these actions will translate into pro fi table growth. Given a highly competitive end-market, risks from AI disintermediation, limited pricing power at FDS and elevated investment

requirements to stay competitive, we believe the company will have di ffi culty in delivering organic revenue growth north of mid-single digits and operating margin expansion simultaneously.

H&R Block (HRB, Sell-rated, $48 12M PT, $6bn market cap): We believe the upcoming 2026 tax season entails risks involving market share loss and limited revenue growth. HRB has relatively subdued expectations for 1% industry tax volume growth in 2026, with an assumed 20 bps mix shift from DIY to assisted that may prove optimistic given the long-standing secular shift from assisted to DIY. The company's F2026 guide at the midpoint also assumes ongoing market share loss in assisted at half the rate of F2025, with market share loss last year attributable to independents' better ability to provide personalized service to tax fi lers. We note HRB's assisted market share has dropped from 24% in F2010 to 15% in F2025, with primarily independents capturing the share. We believe ongoing market share loss in HRB's core assisted tax prep category in a low-growth industry with secular headwinds will drive valuation downside in the shares. In our view, AI is a long-term headwind to

HRB, as well, given the rote and procedural nature of tax preparation and the expensiveness of labor-based assisted tax prep that will likely drive consumers to cheaper AI-fueled alternatives. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Robert Half (RHI, Sell-rated, $24 12M PT, $3bn market cap): Robert Half is continuing to see reduced hiring activity and project starts due to client and job seeker caution, culminating in the company's third year of revenue declines that reached high-single digits y/y on a same day CC basis in 3Q. While RHI observed early signs of stability in temp sta ffi ng weekly sequential revenues in Sept and Oct, 3Q exit rates and guidance point to signi fi cant sustained declines in revenue, which we expect to be pressured by a weakening labor market. The company's Protiviti consulting business also in fl ected to a y/y decline for the fi rst time in a year, signaling elongated sales cycles and smaller project sizes. With sustained revenue declines, RHI is additionally experiencing operating margin contraction from negative operating leverage. Of note, the negative estimate revision cycle at RHI is ongoing, with the guide for 4Q EPS coming more than 30% below consensus, and we view AI as a

long-term threat to low-tier white collar sta ffi ng volumes.

ADT (ADT, Buy-rated, $10.40 12M PT, $7bn market cap): ADT is delivering solid mid-single-digit organic revenue growth despite an uncertain environment, given the defensiveness and resilience of residential security monitoring. ADT is also managing subscriber acquisition costs well to drive strong EPS and FCF. That said, attrition recently ticked higher from greater non-payment cancellations and voluntary losses, while gross RmR additions declined due to minimal direct and dealer channel additions and the small bulk account purchase. ADT's prior sale of its commercial business and wind-down of the unpro fi table solar business drive greater pro fi tability and strategic focus. We continue to expect robust mid-teens FCF growth annually through 2027 that should drive healthy valuation upside.

BrightView (BV, Sell-rated, $10.50 12M PT, $2bn market cap): BrightView is experiencing broad-based revenue declines across its commercial landscape maintenance and development businesses. Maintenance revenue declines re fl ect cyclical pressures in contracted and ancillary revenue, and we expect tough comps from clean-up work following Hurricanes Milton and Helene last year and increased cyclical uncertainty to keep maintenance revenue fl at-to-down over the next 1-2 quarters. Development revenue declines are due to project delays since the start of the year, originally caused by labor shortages related to immigration reform and material shortages related to tari ff s, and have been slow to restart. We continue to believe BV operates in a competitive industry with limited pricing power that makes it di ffi cult to deliver strong revenue growth with margin expansion simultaneously, and we view the ongoing negative estimate revision cycle as a driver of further valuation downside in the shares.

Brink's (BCO, Buy-rated, $129 12M PT, $5bn market cap): Brink's is seeing positive momentum in its high-growth, high-margin Digital Retail Solutions (DRS) and ATM Managed Services (AMS), which collectively accelerated in growth to 19% y/y in 3Q from 16% in 2Q and now represent 27% of TTM total revenue. DRS is bene fi ting from conversions of legacy cash-in-transit customers, while AMS is being lifted by the onboarding of large customers seeking to outsource their ATM fl eet management. Re fl ecting macro defensiveness, BCO's legacy Cash & Valuables Management business remains stable and relatively fl at. We believe BCO's ongoing execution of its DRS/AMS 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

strategy will support solid mid-single-digit revenue growth and 40 bps of EBITDA margin expansion annually, with a greater mix of high-value solutions improving the company's terminal value and sustainability of growth.

Cintas (CTAS, Buy-rated, $253 12M PT, $78bn market cap): Cintas is seeing stable sales cycles and customer purchasing behaviors despite macro uncertainty. Organic revenue growth accelerated from 7.8% y/y in F1Q to 8.6% in F2Q, driven by new sales, record retention rates, pricing increases and expanded service contribution into existing accounts. The company has proven to be resilient to a slowing labor market given its ability to drive customer savings and penetrate the no-programmer market, as well as its greater focus on blue-collar verticals that are less a ff ected by AI. Normalized for last year's gain on asset sale, incremental operating margins are also tracking to be ~30% for the year, consistent with management's 25-35% targeted range, which is supportive of margin expansion over the medium term driven by e ffi ciency initiatives. We believe healthy and resilient organic revenue growth rates in the 7-9% range will drive valuation upside in CTAS shares.

Clarivate (CLVT, Neutral-rated, $3.60 12M PT, $2bn market cap): We believe Clarivate's Value Creation Plan, which involves phasing out transactional sales in favor of subscription o ff erings, upgrading sales talent, improving product innovation and rationalizing the portfolio, will require an extended timeframe to produce meaningful improvements in organic revenue growth, which is tracking to be roughly fl at in 2025, given signi fi cant changes required in the business and end-market pressures. CLVT's organic revenue performance will also be incrementally dampened, in our view, by increasing competition from AI-native entrants across its segments and its limited ability to drive pricing increases beyond low-single digits. The company's organic revenue has been subdued over the past three years, fl uctuating between fl at and low-single-digit declines y/y, and we believe it will take several years before organic revenue growth reaches management's medium-term target in the mid-single-digit range. In contrast, EBITDA

margins at CLVT are robust in the low-40s, above average Info Services peers, and should return to expansion in 2026 as revenue performance and mix begin to improve. We see limited upside potential in CLVT shares over the next year given the likely protracted organic growth turnaround and associated execution risk.

CoStar (CSGP, Buy-rated, $84 12M PT, $26bn market cap): CoStar is delivering accelerating organic revenue growth across its residential and commercial businesses, as well as meaningful margin expansion and EPS growth. CSGP announced plans to lower its net investments in Homes.com by $300mn+ in 2026 and $100mn+ annually thereafter through 2030, with a target to break-even at Homes.com exiting 2029. Homes.com net investments are tracking to be $850mn in 2025. CSGP's 2026 revenue growth guidance of 17.5% implies organic growth of ~11%, representing an acceleration from ~8.5% in 2025, and its 2026 EBITDA margin guidance of 20% represents expansion from 13% in 2025. Meanwhile, the company's medium-term outlook of a 2025-2028 revenue CAGR of 15% and 2028 EBITDA of $1.25bn imply EBITDA margins of ~25.5% in 2028. We believe CSGP's proprietary data, large unvended market opportunity in

commercial, di ff erentiated o ff ering in residential and robust EPS growth from a step-down in Homes.com net investments will drive attractive valuation upside. Equifax (EFX, Neutral-rated, $235 12M PT, $27bn market cap): While Equifax's mortgage volumes surprised to the upside in 3Q, declining less than management expected due to a drop in mortgage rates in Sept, we expect a sharp slowdown in USIS 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

mortgage revenue growth in 2026 and beyond as FICO mortgage score pricing increases no longer pass through the credit bureaus (with FICO going directly to third-party resellers and bypassing the credit bureaus). EFX acknowledged that VantageScore 4.0 uptake by lenders could be slow, and we expect heightened competition for VantageScore given lower price points o ff ered by TRU and EXPN. Beyond mortgages, the broader consumer credit environment is tepid, with minimal card and auto volume growth, and white collar hiring is down due to macro, tari ff s and AI displacements, pressuring the company's background screening business within EWS. The government sector in EWS represents a bright spot for EFX given the federal government's focus on reducing fraud and increased redeterminations for Medicaid and SNAP in 2026. We believe mixed fundamentals are fairly re fl ected in EFX's current valuations.

Gartner (IT, Buy-rated, $390 12M PT, $18bn market cap): Gartner's Insights CV growth continues to decelerate, reaching 3% y/y in 3Q from 5% in 2Q, due to headwinds from the federal government and tari ff s, as well as muted tech vendor trends. The extent of the deceleration came fractionally worse than we expected, and we expect 2% CV growth in 4Q vs 3% growth previously. Management reiterated its expectations for CV growth to reaccelerate to the high-single digits in 2026 and double digits in 2027 as federal and tari ff impacts lap, which contributed CV headwinds of 3% and 1%, respectively, and as tech vendor trends stabilize and operational improvements such as AI innovation and sales e ffi ciencies are executed. We believe IT shares have an attractive risk-reward pro fi le as we see a path to CV growth reacceleration over the next 4-6 quarters, re fl ecting our view that Gartner's Insights product has a wide competitive moat vs AI given its proprietary and

essential content.

KinderCare (KLC, Neutral-rated, $5.20 12M PT, $0.5bn market cap): KinderCare's child care center enrollments declined 2% y/y in 3Q, causing occupancy rates to fall 160 bps y/y to 67%, due to macro headwinds and lower consumer con fi dence, state subsidy headwinds and local market dynamics. We believe enrollment headwinds are currently more pronounced at KLC than peers due to its higher mix of lower income consumers, who are more sensitive to economic uncertainty and more dependent on state subsidy programs for child care. KLC derives approximately one-third of revenue from government subsidies. We view local market dynamics, such as lower conversion of inquiries to enrollments and the need for stronger leadership execution, as idiosyncratic in nature. In addition to enrollment declines, tuition growth decelerated to 2% y/y from higher subsidy mix and rate reductions in some states. Meanwhile, margins are contracting due to negative operating

leverage from enrollment declines. Champions and B2B revenue growth represented bright spots in the quarter. Korn Ferry (KFY, Buy-rated, $77 12M PT, $4bn market cap): We believe Korn Ferry's diversi fi ed business mix confers macro resilience and enables cross-selling and share gains, while its emphasis on executive search provides insulation from AI risks. New business trends at KFY accelerated in y/y growth from F1Q to F2Q, reaching record levels in the months of October and November. The company is bene fi ting from structural labor market trends such as an aging workforce, shifting skill requirements and evolving workforce strategies driving demand for its talent acquisition and consulting solutions. We expect KFY's recent launch of its newest Talent Suite platform to drive improved performance in its consulting and digital businesses, and we view the company's increased focus on selling integrated solutions as a catalyst for greater cross-selling.

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Manpower (MAN, Sell-rated, $27 12M PT, $1bn market cap): Manpower is observing gradual signs of stabilization in Europe and North America sta ffi ng declines, contributing to the fi rst quarter of positive organic CC revenue growth in 3Q 2025 after 11 consecutive quarters of declines. The company is also engaging in a broad-based restructuring initiative, with much of the focus centered on Northern Europe, where demand is the weakest, in order to rightsize costs and improve e ffi ciencies with the help of AI. That said, labor markets remain frozen in terms of hiring and workforce reductions due to economic softening, geopolitical uncertainty, cautious consumer sentiment and the impact of AI, culminating in temp sta ffi ng activity through 3Q coming well below historical levels. MAN is also experiencing gross margin pressures due to an increasing mix of enterprise accounts, which have lower average pricing than smaller accounts, as well as lower permanent placement activity and lower outplacement volumes from a lack of hiring. FCF in 2025

through 3Q was also lackluster due to working capital, tax and technology licensing payments. We believe MAN's revenue and margins will remain constrained over the near term, with increasing risks from a macro slowdown and client AI adoption.

McGraw Hill (MH, Buy-rated, $22 12M PT, $3bn market cap): McGraw Hill is seeing positive momentum in K-12 with capture rates up 200 bps y/y outside of CA, TX and FL, noting FL and TX represented particularly strong adoption cycles for MH last year. Given ~90% of K-12 districts have already made their purchasing decisions for this year, we believe visibility is high into performance for the second half of F2026. We continue to expect a 10%+ rebound in the K-12 addressable market in F2027 based on the adoption schedule for instructional materials across states. The company is also seeing market share gains in its higher education business, driven by growth in Inclusive Access, client adoption of Evergreen, enrollment growth and pricing. We believe market share gains, a rebound in the K-12 TAM in F2027 and strong positioning with AI in the context of the company's proprietary content, adaptive learning technologies and teacher work fl ow automation, will drive healthy valuation upside in MH shares.

Moody's (MCO, Buy-rated, $603 12M PT, $96bn market cap): Moody's is bene fi ting from a strong outlook for debt issuance, including a healthy re fi nancing pipeline and private credit growth, as well as cyclical factors such as rising M&A volumes and declining interest rates that should drive increased debt issuance. As the closest pure-play rating agency, MCO is uniquely positioned to bene fi t from these trends, in our view, noting ratings comprise 53% of total 2025E revenue at MCO. MCO's ratings business is generating low-double-digit y/y growth led by leveraged loans, high yield and fi nancial institutions, with bene fi ts from mix and private credit, and the company expects favorable debt issuance conditions to persist. Meanwhile, we expect MA revenue growth in the high-single-digits is sustainable given stable high-single-digit ARR growth supported by increasing client focus on climate risk and KYC and increasing

AI functionalities. MCO is making further advancements in its AI strategy, including expanding its partnership with Salesforce to o ff er proprietary Gen AI-ready data and agentic AI capabilities, as well as initiatives to drive internal sales and product development e ffi ciencies. We believe favorable growth drivers in MIS and MA with a strong AI overlay will fuel valuation upside. MSCI (MSCI, Buy-rated, $686 12M PT, $45bn market cap): MSCI continues to bene fi t from double-digit growth in asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM linked to MSCI indices in the context of broader market appreciation. Client budget 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

trends remain stable despite an uncertain macro environment, with notable strength in Americas Index and Analytics subscription revenue growth. Subscription revenue growth trends were consistent in 3Q compared to 2Q, with ~6% y/y active asset manager and 12% non-active asset manager growth despite tougher comps, reinforcing a stable environment that will likely improve as AUMs continue to rise. We believe MSCI's signi fi cant focus on product innovation leveraging AI creates opportunity for strong price realization and upsell, as well as meaningful margin e ffi ciencies that the company intends to reinvest back into the business to drive growth. We expect product innovation leveraging MSCI's proprietary data and risk models to drive accelerating subscription revenue growth and upside in the shares, ampli fi ed by the company's $1.5bn buyback in 2025 through 3Q and $3bn new repurchase authorization supported by cash and leverage.

NCR Atleos (NATL, Neutral-rated, $37 12M PT, $3bn market cap): NCR Atleos is seeing positive momentum with its ATMaaS strategy, with ATMaaS revenue growth of 37% y/y in 3Q and company expectations for that to accelerate to 40%+ in 4Q, driven by demand for the outsourcing of comprehensive ATM fl eet management. NATL also bene fi ted from strong 24% y/y growth in hardware, lifted by the refresh cycle of devices installed during 2019 and uptake of upgraded cash recycler products. That said, the Network segment remains in decline due to prepaid payroll card softness, and Network margins continue to be under pressure due to cash rental costs, with evolving tari ff policy an added source of uncertainty for margins. We believe positive traction with NATL's ATMaaS strategy is balanced by the Network segment's near-term growth and margin pressures.

Pitney Bowes (PBI, Neutral-rated, $11 12M PT, $2bn market cap): Pitney Bowes has e ff ectively executed a multi-year transformation to meaningfully improve pro fi tability, with the exit of the unpro fi table Global Ecommerce business and implementation of a ~$250mn cost savings program boosting EBITDA margins from mid-teens in 2023 to high-20s currently. PBI has also reduced leverage and shifted its capital allocation priorities toward share buybacks and dividend increases. The company is managing through secular headwinds in the mailing industry, with US mail volumes declining 3-4% on average annually over the past decade, which has placed pressure particularly on the SendTech business. We believe PBI can drive an in fl ection to low-single-digit revenue growth over the medium-term from a mid-single-digit decline in 2025 from several initiatives. Within SendTech, these include product investments into mail meters, sales force restructuring to be vertically based and expansion of the

non-captive fi nancing business. Within Presort, these include share gains leveraging scale following recent USPS regulatory changes and tuck-in acquisitions. We believe PBI's current valuations fairly balance its transformation strategy with secular declines in mailing. Phoenix Education Partners (PXED, Neutral-rated, $37 12M PT, $2bn market cap): Phoenix Education Partners is seeing healthy applicant interest, new student growth and retention rates, with traction with employer partnerships and use of AI to enhance marketing and the student experience. Meanwhile, new Gainful Employment metrics show all of PXED's programs reporting data so far have passed the minimum earnings threshold, reducing regulatory risk. That said, enrollment growth is decelerating in F2026 from F2025 due to actions that the company said it was taking to combat fraud and suspicious enrollment activity that are fi ltering out applicants with a higher risk of non-persistence or fraudulent intent. Additionally, improved controls to fi lter out

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 students fl agged for unusual enrollment activity or lower success attributes are causing revenue per student to normalize and decline in F2026 from elevated levels in F2025. We believe decelerating revenue growth from mid-single digits in F2025 to low-single digits in F2026, as well as contracting margins from public company costs and investments, is fairly re fl ected in PXED's discounted valuation multiple relative to peers.

Rollins (ROL, Buy-rated, $64 12M PT, $30bn market cap): Rollins' operating performance re fl ects the inherent resilience of its business model attributable to the non-cyclical and essential nature of pest control, as well as the company's idiosyncratic initiatives to drive growth. ROL is delivering robust organic revenue growth in the 7-8% range, consistent with the company's growth outlook over the medium term, lifted by increased residential cross-selling activity, a sharper focus in commercial and broader share gains from competitors. M&A opportunities in a fragmented market add to the overall growth outlook, with ROL typically targeting 200-300 bps of growth contribution from acquisitions annually. Further, EBITDA margins are expanding meaningfully y/y driven by operating leverage and e ffi ciencies in its procurement, technology and back-o ffi ce functions. We believe ROL has valuation upside potential given its strong and durable organic growth outlook, which we fi nd appealing in the current uncertain macro

environment. TransUnion (TRU, Neutral-rated, $92 12M PT, $17bn market cap): TransUnion is delivering mid-single-digit y/y non-mortgage revenue growth on an OCC basis, or high-single digits excluding the breach win, re fl ecting accelerated growth in emerging verticals, bene fi ts from product innovation and share gains against a backdrop of largely stable lending conditions. TRU also bene fi ts from a discounted valuation multiple relative to credit bureau peers. That said, we expect mortgage revenue growth to decelerate sharply in 2026 when FICO bypasses the credit bureaus and sells its mortgage scores directly to resellers. We also see risks from a weakening labor market and an economic slowdown that could cause revenue growth to decelerate, with the lower-tier consumer more exposed. We believe lack of an explicit framework on capital allocation could also constrain valuations.

UL Solutions (ULS, Neutral-rated, $79 12M PT, $16bn market cap): UL Solutions is delivering resilient and accelerating organic revenue growth across its segments despite an uncertain macro environment, re fl ecting secular tailwinds and the essential nature of testing, inspection and certi fi cation services. Performance is being led by high-single-digit growth in the Industrial segment fueled by accelerating data center build-out and ongoing mega trends including industrial automation, the electri fi cation of everything and digitization. The company plans to exit certain non-strategic, TIC service lines in Industrial and Consumer to focus on higher-growth areas, which the company expects to improve annual operating income by $25-30mn once the restructuring is completed by 1Q 2027, though organic growth will be dampened by 100 bps in 2026 as a result of these actions. Operating leverage and cost e ffi ciencies are driving solid and expanding EBITDA margins in the mid-20s. We believe ULS' healthy organic growth and margin pro fi

le, secular tailwinds and strong execution are fairly re fl ected in its premium valuation multiple relative to peers. Verisk (VRSK, Neutral-rated, $239 12M PT, $31bn market cap): We believe VRSK's proprietary and essential data enables sustainable 6-8% long-term organic revenue growth and confers a wide competitive moat vs AI. Verisk's organic CC revenue growth is stepping down from high-single digits in 1H 2025 to mid-single digits over the near-term 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

due to a high-single-digit decline in transactional revenue in light of historically low levels of severe weather activity that has reduced demand for property estimating solutions, as well as auto market share losses. We also expect subscription growth to continue to decelerate toward the 6-8% range as transactional revenue conversions taper, attrition levels revert toward historical levels and insurance net written premium growth decelerates. VRSK recently announced that it has terminated its de fi nitive agreement to acquire AccuLynx for $2.35bn after noti fi cation by the FTC that it has not completed its review of the transaction by the 12/26 termination date speci fi ed in the agreement. We believe decelerating organic CC revenue growth and recent negative estimate revisions will limit upside in VRSK shares.

Vestis (VSTS, Sell-rated, $5.30 12M PT, $0.9bn market cap): We believe Vestis' organic revenue growth turnaround will be constrained by persistent customer service quality issues that are di ffi cult to remediate quickly given signi fi cant process standardization, technology integration, talent training and cultural change required at the local level. The company has limited pricing power in its business, with pricing up just 0-1% y/y in recent quarters given service quality issues, which we expect to contribute to a prolonged recovery in organic revenue. The need to rebuild the sales force after recent reductions and install appropriate sales tools and processes to win and retain customers will also be time intensive, in our view. Based on our estimates, VSTS is experiencing same day organic revenue declines of 2% in CY2024, 4% in CY2025 and 1% in CY2026, meaningfully underperforming uniform rental peer CTAS where growth is tracking in the positive high-single-digit range. Importantly, VSTS had net leverage of 4.72x

as of F4Q 2025, which comes close to covenant requirements of 5.25x, limiting the company's ability to reinvest in the business to e ff ectively drive an organic growth turnaround. We believe ongoing market share losses and a constrained ability to deploy capital will drive downside in VSTS shares. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

(-) Regulatory changes to Title IV aid, challenges with 90/10 Rule or                                                                         |
| PXED     | Phoenix Education | Neutral  | $31.71           | $37            | 4.00x NTM + 1YR EBITDA of $271mn, forecast NTM average net debt of -$0,375mn and forecast NTM shares outstanding of 39mn. Our target multiple is below the for-profit education peer group median to reflect PXED's modestly lower revenue growth and EBITDA margins relative to peers, decelerating revenue growth in F2026, and lack of a recent public market track record.                                                                                            | Gainful Employment compliance, slower enrollment growth from competition or fraud controls and any deterioration in student outcomes that could impact reputation and federal funding eligibility. (+) Potential enrollment acceleration, increased B2B employer partnership traction, greater regulatory clarity or changes to federal funding, successful execution of technology-driven initiatives, and strong returns to shareholders enabled by no debt and an asset-light operating model. |
| RHI      | Robert Half       | Sell     | $27.86           | $24            | 9.0x NTM + 1YR EPS of $2.70. Our target multiple represents a discount to the staffing peer median to reflect RHI's exposure to the lower growth FP&A and admin/customer support end-markets, mitigated by scale advantages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Improving macroeconomic conditions, strong Protiviti growth, market share gains, and margin expansion from operating leverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ROL      | Rollins           | Buy      | $61.64           | $64            | 30.0x NTM + 1YR EBITDA of $1047mn, forecast NTM net debt of $192mn and forecast NTM shares outstanding of 485mn. Our target multiple represents a premium to the Business Services peer group median to reflect ROL' higher revenue growth, higher EBITDA margins, attractive scale and route density, healthy balance sheet, and strong track record of execution.                                                                                                       | Potential market loss if the acquisition of TMX by RTO creates a well- integrated scaled competitor in the US, adverse weather or climate changes that could reduce pest activity, a shortage of labor supply or rising labor costs, supply chain disruptions, environmental safety and acquisition integration risks.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ULS      | UL Solutions      | Neutral  | $80.98           | $79            | 18.0x NTM + 1YR EBITDA of $895mn, forecast NTM average net cash of $2mn and forecast NTM shares outstanding of 203mn. Our target multiple comes at a premium to European TIC peer group median reflecting strong execution as a new public company, robust Industrial growth trends and improving efficiencies, partially mitigated by its lower FCF conversion from EBITDA compared to peers.                                                                            | (-) Macro and geopolitical uncertainty, premium pricing relative to competitors, elevated investments into growth initiatives that could limit the pace of future margin expansion and FX (+) acceleration in the rate of product innovation, effective returns on the company's recent laboratory and testing site investments, regulatory actions that impose more stringent safety standards, M&A activity and efficiency gains at testing facilities.                                         |
| VSTS     | Vestis            | Sell     | $6.46            | $5.30          | 6.20x NTM + 1YR EBITDA of $314mn, forecast NTM net debt of $1,245mn and forecast NTM shares outstanding of 135mn. Our target multiple comes below the Business Services peer group median to reflect lower revenue growth, EBITDA margins and higher financial leverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Improvements in customer service quality, effective reinvestments into product innovation, increased sales force productivity and effective execution of cost cutting initiatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

We, George K. Tong, CFA, Sami Nasir, CFA, Anna Wu and Alex Lakritz, hereby certify that all of the views expressed in this report accurately re fl ect our personal views about the subject company or companies and its or their securities. We also certify that no part of our compensation was, is or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the speci fi c recommendations or views expressed in this report. Unless otherwise stated, the individuals listed on the cover page of this report are analysts in Goldman Sachs' Global Investment Research division.

Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.
