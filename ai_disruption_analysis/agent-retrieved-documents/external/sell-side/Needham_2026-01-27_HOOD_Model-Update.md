Robinhood is positioned to be a major beneficiary of more positive regulation within the crypto space, while emerging as a leader in its equity & options offering via advanced trading product launches. We expect HOOD to launch a number of new crypto related products, in particular those that appeal to a retail customer base, in 2025 which should allow the company to take share from centralized and decentralized peers. Additionally, we believe with a more advanced equity & options and robust margin product offering, HOOD becomes closer to a one-stop shop for all things financial services. Our PT is predicated on a 33x our discounted '26 EV/EBITDA multiple.

Crypto revenues surge as the bitcoin bull market leads to "alt season", a period of heightened alt coin valuations and trading, throughout 2025. Equity and options activity rises substantially amid declining interest rates. HOOD diversifies and grows its customer base by launching more products, including narrowing the gap to peers on crypto asset offerings. We believe 36x our '26 EV/EBITDA is an appropriate valuation multiple.

Robinhood (HOOD) is a leading e-broker and fintech company offering investors a platform to trade equities, options, and crypto as well as yield-based products, crypto wallet, and payment cards. The company generates the majority of its revenue from trading (41% in 2023 and 42% in 2022) and net interest revenue from margin trading, securities lending, and cash sweeps. The company's targeted demographic is younger, first-time investors.

HOOD top-line grows 30% in 2025 as declining interest rates and a pro-crypto regulatory outlook leads to increased trading volumes across the board. HOOD adds new products expands its crypto offerings, leading to more rapid user growth. HOOD becomes a key beneficiary of the crypto bull market and steps closer to a one-stop-shop for financial services as retail customers come back into the market. In this case we believe 33x our '26 EV/EBITDA is an appropriate valuation multiple.

Our Price Target of $145 is based on an EV/EBITDA multiple of 33x our 2026 estimate, ahead of the brokerage and exchange peer group and other companies operating in the high growth financial services vertical (COIN at 25x). Our multiple primarily reflects HOOD's leverage to a high growth vertical (crypto), tokenized assets, prediction markets and its competitive positioning as a one-stop shop for all things financial services with very robust product growth. We also view the improved regulatory climate for exchanges, in particular crypto platforms and prediction markets, as the removal of an overhang on HOOD.

General liquidity conditions easing. Broad equity and crypto market rally.

A broad-based decline in equity, options, crypto trading volumes. We see risk of a worsening regulatory environment around payment for order flow in the US (key tenet of HOOD's business model). In June 2023, the EU issued rules that formally ban payment for order flow by 2026. This poses a risk to HOOD's upcoming UK expansion as the company will have to rely on non-PFOF sources of income. Robinhood has been the focus of lawsuits in the past, and we could see similar risks arising in the future.
