Industrial Technology Brian Gesuale | (727) 567-2287 | brian.gesuale@raymondjames.com Mitch Ingles, CFA, Sr. Res. Assoc. | (727) 567-6035 | mitch.ingles@raymondjames.com Ryan Rackley, Sr. Res.

The company wrapped up an eventful CES and despite execution inconsistencies over the past couple years, the risk/reward skews favorably as the core business has stabilized, higher content products get closer to revenue matriculation, and the company has a couple of embedded call options in the robotaxi and humanoid robotic space that need duration to mature but are free to investors at current levels. The company provided additional details on the second Top-10 OEM to adopt Surround ADAS, acquired Mentee Robotics, and began to lay the foundation for a company beyond the automotive industry with considerable earnings leverage to incremental revenue. The obvious earnings leverage comes from an R&D line that is ~50% of our revenue projections. We reiterate our Outperform rating and $19 price target.

Mentee Robotics: Platform optionality, contained near-term risk: Mobileye announced an agreement to acquire Mentee Robotics for $900M (~$612M cash + up to ~26.2M shares; ~3% dilution), with closing expected in 1Q26. We view this as a strategic Physical AI platform move - adding a vertically integrated humanoid robotics product line and AI talent while leveraging MBLY's existing strengths in edge AI, simulation/validation, and RSS safety. Financial impact appears contained: Low-single digit 2026 adj. opex lift, no meaningful near-term revenue (proofof-concept deployments in 2026; commercialization targeted 2028), and Mentee will operate independently without disrupting Automotive R&D execution. Surround ADAS: Moving advanced ADAS into the mainstream: Mobileye announced additional details of a second Top-10 automaker which selected its EyeQ6H-powered Surround

ADAS, bringing expected future deliveries to >19M surround systems (including ~9M tied to the newly announced U.S. OEM, in addition to VW programs). This was incremental detail to the already disclosed design win. Management reiterated mid-2028 SOP and positioned surround as the next evolution of mainstream ADAS for SDV architectures (hands-free, eyes-on) with higher content/ vehicle vs. front-camera ADAS. Furthermore, OEM roadmaps increasingly point to advanced ADAS moving down-market by 2028, perhaps jump started by BYD's broad inclusion of technology, Ford's plans to introduce higher-capability systems on ~$30K vehicle platforms (Ford), and eyesoff functionality debuting on flagship EVs (GM) amongst other broader industry points. We view this as reinforcing that higher-content ADAS is becoming mainstream, consistent with the timing and positioning of Mobileye's Surround ADAS roadmap.

Model Update: We now model 2027 revenue/AEBITDA of $2.3B/$543M vs. the consensus view of $2.5B/$607M. We continue to see Surround ADAS and SuperVision driving a meaningful uplift in content/vehicle over time - supporting a path for average ADAS content/vehicle to reach ~$100 in the early 2030s (vs. ~$50 today).

Shares of MBLY trade at ~26x our NTM EBITDA while our $19 target is based on ~26x our 2027 EBITDA estimate and represents ~65% upside to the stock.

Mobileye is a leading ADAS and autonomy technology provider with solutions deployed across 13 of the top 15 global OEMs. With the core business stabilizing, growth is increasingly driven by higher-content ADAS, particularly the shift toward Surround ADAS on softwaredefined vehicle platforms. Beyond automotive, Mobileye retains embedded optionality in robotaxi and humanoid robotics, supported by a common autonomy stack and significant earnings leverage as content per vehicle and scale increase.

Mobileye Global, Inc. engages in the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AV) technologies and solutions. The company was founded by Amnon Shashua in 1999 and is headquartered in Jerusalem, Israel.

| Bear Case   | Current Price   | Price Target (Base Case)   | Bull Case   |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| $9.00       | $11.55          | $19.00                     | $24.00      |

Our bull case target of $24 is based on a ~32x multiple of our 2027E EBITDA, toward the upper end of Mobileye's historical trading range. This scenario would be supported by faster-than-expected Surround ADAS monetization, incremental Top-10 OEM wins that sustain above-market unit growth, and meaningful operating leverage as R&D intensity declines with revenue scale. Additional upside could come from earlier commercial traction in highercontent programs (SuperVision, Chauffeur, Drive) and the market assigning greater value to Mobileye's embedded call options in robotaxi and humanoid robotics.

Analyst Compensation : Research analysts and associates at Raymond James are compensated on a salary and bonus system. Several factors enter into the compensation determination for an analyst, including: i) research quality, ii) team productivity, iii) client feedback, iv) rating accuracy, v) overall revenue and profitability levels of the department and firm (a portion of which is generated by investment banking activities) and vi) compensation levels for comparable research analysts at competing firms. Registration of Non-U.S. Analysts : The analysts listed on the front of this report who are not employees of, or associated with, RJA are not registered/qualified as research analysts under FINRA rules and are not subject to FINRA Rule 2241 restrictions on communications with covered companies, trading securities held by a research analyst account, and obligations related to identifying and managing conflicts of interest.

This global disclosure considers all entities of Raymond James and its affiliates. The jurisdiction where the analyst(s) is registered will determine what is permitted. For example, if the persons responsible for the content of this report are not licensed as research analysts in accordance with applicable rules promulgated by the regulatory organization(s) where this report is distributed, any client wishing to effect trades in any security should contact their Raymond James representative. The analyst Brian Gesuale, primarily responsible for the preparation of this research report, attests to the following: (1) that the views and opinions rendered in this research report reflect his or her personal views about the subject companies or issuers and (2) that no part of the research analyst's compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views in this research report.

Our methodology of calculating fair value for MBLY includes a multi-tiered framework of comparables analysis, including EV/EBITDA, as well as a DCF valuation.

Following are some general risk factors that pertain to the businesses of the subject companies and the projected target prices and recommendations included on Raymond James research: (1) Industry fundamentals with respect to customer demand or product/service pricing could change and adversely impact expected revenues and earnings; (2) issues relating to major competitors or market shares or new product expectations could change investor attitude toward the sector or this stock; (3) Unforeseen developments with respect to the management, financial condition or accounting policies or practices could alter the prospective valuation.

Mobileye participates in highly competitive markets where a significant and growing number of established and new technology companies and auto manufacturers have entered.

The company may encounter unexpected delays or technical and production challenges.

A global semiconductor shortage could impact the supply of EyeQ SoC.

Mobileye currently depends on STMicroelectronics solely to manufacture EyeQ SoCs, and STMicroelectronics depends on TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) as its subcontractor. As a result, Mobileye is vulnerable to the risk that STMicroelectronics or TSMC may be unable to meet demand or cease operations. Additionally, Mobileye will depend on Quanta to manufacture the ECUs for Mobileye Chauffeur, Mobileye SuperVision, and Mobileye Drive, and will depend on Intel for the fabrication of silicon photonics used in FMCW LiDAR. To the extent that access to such technologies is curtailed, it will adversely impact the results of operations, and financial condition.

Mobileye depends on a limited number of Tier 1 customers and OEMs for a substantial portion of revenue. The three largest Tier 1 customers - ZF, Valeo, and Aptiv - accounted for 30%, 24%, and 14% of 2023 revenue, respectively. A sales reduction or loss of one or more key customers could negatively impact revenue and operations. However, these Tier 1 automotive suppliers are directly selling through multiple OEMs.

Mobileye has heavy exposure to China. If there were further trade restrictions and additional or increased tariffs and export controls imposed at short notice, Mobileye may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such actions.

Moderate Risk/Provide Income (M/INC) Larger capitalization, lower volatility (beta) equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings, and dividend yields meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. Many securities in this category are structured with a focus on providing a consistent dividend or return of capital. Moderate Risk/Wealth Accumulation (M/ACC) Larger capitalization equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings growth, the potential for long-term price appreciation, and often a dividend yield. Moderately Aggressive Risk/ Provide Income (MA/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a dividend meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. These companies typically feature sound financials, positive earnings, and the potential for long-term price appreciation. Moderately Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (MA/ACC) Generally equities of companies in fast growing and competitive industries with less predictable earnings (or losses), potentially more

leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, and potential risk of principal. Aggressive Risk/Provide Income (A/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a meaningful dividend but may face less predictable earnings (or losses), more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, financial and competitive issues, higher price volatility (beta), and meaningful risk of loss of principal. Securities of companies in this category may have a more volatile income stream from dividends or distributions of capital. Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) Generally equities of companies with a short or unprofitable operating history, limited or less predictable revenues, high risk associated with success, high volatility (beta), potential significant financial or legal issues, and the meaningful risk of loss of principal.

RJL has developed a proprietary algorithm for risk rating individual securities. The algorithm utilizes data from multiple vendors, and all data is refreshed at least monthly. Accordingly, suitability ratings are updated monthly. The suitability rating shown on this report is current as of the report's published date. In the event that a suitability rating changes after the published date, the new rating will not be reflected until the analyst publishes a subsequent report.
