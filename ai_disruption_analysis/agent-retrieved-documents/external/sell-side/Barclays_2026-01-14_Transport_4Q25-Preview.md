With truckload (TL) rates moving higher in early 2026 for the first time in several years, investor enthusiasm that the freight cycle has positively inflected is building and driving a rally in most transportation equities over the past two months. However, with most data and market commentary pointing to tighter trucking supply as the primary culprit supporting higher freight rates, we suspect early 2026 could remain challenging from a demand perspective, as has been the case across most of the sector for several years. Please see our recent analysis of sector performance during prior TL rate inflection periods here: "Transport Stock Performance Following TL Rate Inflections." There are some bright spots such as growth in domestic intermodal (favorably offsetting international declines for the rails) which is likely to support favorable volume commentary from companies such as J.B. Hunt and Hub Group. But the data does not lie — early 2026 reads on rail demand, TL volumes, LTL tonnage and international imports remain subdued and or negative given “tough” comparisons from pull forward activity present in early 2025 as supply chains rushed to get ahead of being

liberated. Adding it up we unfortunately expect most transport guidance and management commentary to reflect the still soft volume aspects present in many freight verticals while acknowledging the obvious favorable turn in trucking rates. With TL inflation likely to increase for shippers in 2026, we at least take solace that yield expansion could be more prevalent for railroads, driving favorable pricing outcomes beyond the consistency of Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) and parcel verticals in the past year. Given this slightly more favorable but still relatively subdued freight backdrop in 2026, we expect most management teams will take a “wait and see” approach to forward forecasts, likely sticking to a still conservative outlook while acknowledging plenty of upside could develop, especially if large end-market demand from core industrial shippers and/or the housing market accelerates given likely lower interest rates and a greater focus on domestic production. In this note we update our transportation forecasts for recent industry volume, pricing and fuel estimates and provide commentary by sector verticals and specific stocks.

As we await a broader turn in freight demand, our focus in early 2026 is on idiosyncratic opportunities such as C.H. Robinson (CHRW), likely favorable railroad M&A developments Equity Research 14 January 2026 North America Transportation POSITIVE Unchanged North America Transportation Brandon R.

(UNP & NSC), the upcoming freight spin at FedEx (FDX) and Fortress Aviation’s entrance into the AI driven power market (FTAI). For greater thoughts on these and other stocks, please see our recent 2026 outlook for more details, “6-7 Stocks for 2026; Upgrade CHRW and LUV.” Perhaps it is not overly shocking that two of our idiosyncratic stocks are supported by developments in AI, with CHRW set to benefit from lower costs and higher productivity through leveraging agentic AI in its operations and FTAI entering into the power generation market utilizing end of life jet engines to extend the value of its portfolio. While we acknowledge the recent rise in TL rates could “squeeze” gross margins at CHRW and other brokerage competitors in early 2026, we expect management will nonetheless point to significant operational efficiency gains and AI-supported commercial initiatives that could support net margin expansion despite known market headwinds. For the railroads, recent proposed rule changes

by the US STB regulator (see "Proposed US Rail Switching Regulations Could Aid M&A Competitive Review") making it easier for captive shippers to request service from a competing railroad via reciprocal switching could be setting the stage for a smoother review process of the UNP-NSC merger application, potentially supporting a more favorable STB initial response in the coming weeks relative to skeptical investor sentiment around the complexities of the M&A process. Rounding out our idiosyncratic focus for early 2026 is Fedex, given the upcoming Freight LTL spin (in June) as well as the ongoing integration of the prior Express and Ground package businesses which we suspect continue to drive core profitably higher throughout 2026.

Railroad outlook in 2026 will likely be defined by still weak core volume performance but potentially buoyed by M&A developments. For the US railroads, we suspect much of the stock performance this year will be dictated by the level of scrutiny the STB places on the merger application between UNP and NSC. Nonetheless, on a standalone basis we expect Union Pacific to speak to service driven volume opportunities this year but likely with some offsets from a still weak west coast import outlook. For Norfolk Southern, we expect a focus on improving safety and supporting service will drive management to err on the side of additional costs, likely engendering lower margins relative to market expectations. At CSX, recent challenges in export coal markets and some network incidents could dent near-term outcomes but we expect new CEO Steve Angel to set a more aggressive long-term agenda for the once industry-leading east coast network. At Canadian Pacific Kansas City we expect the company to again guide for double digit EPS growth in 2026 despite known market headwinds from US

tariffs as the well executing management team continues to deliver on synergy upside form improved single line rail service. And finally for Canadian National, recent results likely support a more favorable near-term earrings picture, but we expect recent management changes will keep a lid on guidance, potentially setting up for relatively stronger outcomes as the year progresses.

Truckload commentary set to turn more positive given recent move in spot rates. As we have been monitoring in our weekly notes (see "Barclays T.R.U.C.K.S" published 13 Jan 2026 for the most recent), TL spot rates surged 20-30% in the final seven weeks of 2025 and are now up double digits on a YoY basis. The sharp rebound comes on the heels of nearly three years at trough levels during which capacity (as proxied by FMCSA operating authorities) slowly exited the market. Recent regulatory action to enforce English-language proficiency and more restrictive non-domicile CDL rules (administrative stay notwithstanding) have likely served as a catalyst for more measurable moves late last year, with broad industrial indicators such as the ISM PMI still lackluster through December (though we note some carriers did call out decent peak demand activity, indicating retail consumption has held in). The primary question now facing shippers, carriers and investors is whether the recent tightness can persist through a

seasonally slower period (e.g. Jan & Feb), which could have material implications for bid season outcomes over the coming months. We take a somewhat measured view and do not bake in any further gains until later in 2026, giving way to a gradual upcycle into 2027. The result is spot rates up about 10% in each of the next two years, with contract rates up 3% in 2026 (vs. our 14 January 2026 2 Barclays | North America Transportation

prior 2% forecast) and mid-single digits in 2027. There is certainly a case for more upside, as we only model 25-30% of seasonally-adjusted trough-to-peak spot improvement (vs. historical cycles closer to 40%) with peak rates lagging broader economic inflation by nearly 20% (vs. 10-20% of outperformance in historical cycles, see Figure 8). However, given numerous head fakes in recent years as well as a lack of clear demand support, we prefer to take a relatively conservative view. During earnings season we expect mixed commentary from Knight-Swift on the quarter (with a squeeze in Logistics and soft demand in LTL) but likely some incremental optimism for 2026. Werner is likely to face questions regarding an incremental pivot into the less-cyclical Dedicated trucking vertical, while pure-play Heartland Express could feasibly see a more improved margin outlook (albeit with top-line missing expectations in recent periods).

LTL fundamentals likely little-changed despite recent share price improvement. ODFL, SAIA and XPO equities have improved an average of nearly 20% since the end of November (vs. the S&P 500 +1%), fueled by the recent improvement in truckload spot rates. As we discussed in our recent note "Transport Stock Performance Following TL Rate Inflections" published 8 Jan 2026, TL upcycles have historically coincided with meaningful outperformance in LTL stocks, likely explaining some of the recent moves. Nonetheless, with industrial output still lagging, we expect messaging from LTL management teams will ring similar to the past few years in which weak demand has been offset by consistent pricing gains. We trim our forward estimates accordingly (with lower fuel prices also having an impact) but note earnings upside remains substantial in an eventual demand recovery. While sentiment for XPO has been more mixed in recent periods, we remain optimistic that the company can improve margins this year even if volumes are flat to down, as management has established credibility generating above-market

yield gains. Saia is also likely to make a case for at least some OR improvement in 2026 as newer terminals mature, though mix likely remained a headwind in 4Q. Old Dominion had a solid November and likely continued to deliver solid price and cost control, but we expect 2026 will represent the fourth consecutive year of tonnage declines for the carrier.

The intermodal space should see some volume improvement but still muted yield gains, with cost performance likely driving stock reactions in the near term. J.B. Hunt's domestic intermodal volumes have outpaced primary partner rail carriers Norfolk Southern and Burlington Northern for the last two quarters as international import volumes contracted, a trend we expect continued in the fourth quarter. Volume contraction at Hub Group and Knight Swift intermodal should also be modest. The recent increase in trucking rates will eventually benefit intermodal yields, but we would expect the effect to be muted in the short term (see Figure 12 and "Seeking Predictive Power in TL Rates"), with rates largely locked in through the spring. The more immediate effect will likely be increased incentive to shift volumes to intermodal, but we do not expect material mode shift until well into 2026. Intermodal marketing companies are likely to be judged heavily during earnings season on expense performance, with progress toward a $100mm cost reduction initiative likely critical for investor sentiment around J.B. Hunt.

Truck broker results likely to be impaired in the short term by reduced gross margins, with forwarding yields likely to be low in 2026. The aforementioned surge in trucking spot rates is a net negative for truck brokers in the near term, with purchased transportation costs "squeezing" gross margins before contract rates can catch up (see Figure 13 and Figure 14), driving our below consensus earnings at major truck brokers C.H. Robinson, Landstar, RXO and Hub Group. We expect C.H. Robinson to guide to favorable cost outcomes in 2026 as the company continues to leverage technology to drive down operating expenses and improve carrier selection, which we believe investors will view favorably even if 4Q earnings fall short of near-term expectations. Landstar's BCO independent contractor model and high spot exposure should support earnings more so than competitors. In forwarding, tepid air and ocean rates should maintain decent gross margins through 1Q, and demand for customs brokerage should 14 January 2026 3 Barclays | North America Transportation

We est. 4Q came in at the low end of the guide range given more condensed peak demand, a margin squeeze in Logistics and soft demand in LTL; however, the December surge in TL spot rates could support a favorable shift in management's forward commentary. Werner recently noted solid peak season trends and has been bullish that recent regulatory action could materially constrain industry supply.

Investors likely interested in management's decision to pivot further into Dedicated amid a rebound in One-Way spot rates. Norfolk's merchandise volumes have been relatively resilient, though intermodal share losses and incremental coal yield headwinds are likely to pressure the top line. Excess resources amid the STB's merger review could weigh on earnings potential in 2026. UNP's volumes came in ahead of our prior expectations, albeit with mix perhaps a bit less of a tailwind and derailments likely to pressure casualty costs. Investors likely to remain most interested in M&A, particularly with STB's initial comments forthcoming. L o g is ti c s RXO earnings will likely be materially impacted in 4Q and 1Q by the recent surge in trucking rates; we see 4Q EBITDA at the low end or below prior guidance, with 1Q guidance likely below seasonality. Expect an update on cost reductions as Coyote synergies are realized. O th

. Continued progress with SCI partnerships and international expansion should drive a reiteration or increase in EBITDA guidance. Investors will likely focus on details of converting engines to power turbines, including impacts on margins and asset lifespans. In te rm o d . Barclays EPS (cons.) Landstar's BCO model should insulate earnings from trucking spot rate increases in comparison to pure play brokers. We expect continued gains in heavy haul industrial loads, but reduce near-term forecasts on expected brokerage gross margin weakness. R a il ro a d s Management called out $40mm of earnings headwinds in 4Q from a coal derailment and lower auto shipments; expect focus on new CEO Steve Angel's recent cost-cutting actions as well as latest thoughts on M&A. Guidance may focus on bottom line in focus shift for CSX. December volumes outperformed expectations, which would benefit the top line and margins for 4Q. We expect a conservative guide for both 2026

volume and earnings as trade tensions and a weak housing market are partially offset by strong energy demand. 4Q volumes came in below our forecast, but we expect yields and cost controls will deliver 2025 earnings near the low end of guidance. Although reduced intracontinental trade in auto and consumer goods could weigh, we still expect double digit earnings growth guidance for 2026. The intermodal and dedicated businesses should be delayed in benefiting from trucking spot rates increases; weak demand and high brokerage costs should drive 4Q EPS low in the range. Despite continued cost improvements, we expect a conservative 2026 EPS guide. Despite weak volumes at existing customer facilities, we see 3.5-6.5% organic revenue growth as achievable; legal and tax charges may weigh on EPS and FCF. New growth pipeline disclosure will be critical to supporting 2026 outlook, which could be in the MSD range. 4Q results will likely be hindered by higher PT costs, but we expect the market will be more interested in the potential for cost reductions due to AI

implementation. Forwarding earnings likely to remain weak but recent increases in trans-Pac ocean spot should benefit 1Q. Customs brokerage continues to benefit from global market volatility and supply chain repositioning, but higher trade barriers and reduced trans-Pac throughput should weigh on volumes and yields; recent airfreight rate declines should support 1Q gross margins. L T L November tonnage and yields came in ahead of expectations, possibly supporting a 4Q OR in the favorable end of the guide range. Investors continue to await a demand inflection. Lower fuel prices are likely an incremental earnings headwind in '26. Saia's daily tonnage turned positive in November, albeit on a likely easier comparison given shifts in GRI timing. Mix likely remains a challenge given growth in 1-2 day lanes and declines in southern California. Investors likely eager to calibrate OR outcomes for 2026. XPO's November volumes came in below seasonality, with the run rate indicating declines will likely persist into the first half of 2026. Investors

interested in margin expansion potential in a flat volume environment as well as capital priorities for this year.

Ryder has established an above- market growth trajectory within the expanding leasing, rental and contract logistics segments, but is valued at lower levels than peers, which suggests significant potential upside in the company’s shares if growth prospects can be maintained.

Upside case Ryder's upside case is estimated assuming a stronger economy increases freight rates, demand for new and used trucks, while a lower 10-yr yield improves borrowing costs. Under this scenario, we assume market multiples would remain consistent with mid-cycle levels. Downside case Ryder’s downside case is estimated assuming weaker freight and new and used truck markets, higher 10- yr yield and borrowing costs and lower earnings relative to our estimates. Under this scenario we assume market multiples compress to near trough levels.

Valuation Methodology: We value EXPD shares at $135, which is based on an average of 16.0x EV/EBITDA and 23.5x P/E multiples on our 2027 EBITDA forecast of $1.0bn and our 2027 EPS forecast of $5.80, respectively. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Risks specific to Expeditors: Increasing competition in asset-light and digital freight service providers could pressure Expeditors' ability to maintain its current margin profile. Consolidation in Ocean shippers could increase the value to Expeditors' ocean capacity. Disruptions in global trade resulting from geopolitical tensions or other factors could materially impact freight throughput among Expeditors' carrier base, including presenting outsized opportunities to increase gross margins. FX fluctuations can

significantly affect Expeditors' earnings given the company's global exposure. FTAI Aviation Ltd. (FTAI / FTAI) Valuation Methodology: We value FTAI Aviation Ltd (FTAI) shares at $260 based on an 18.5x EV/EBITDA multiple on our 2027 EBITDA estimate of $1.6bn. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation and transportation related companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Risks specific to FTAI include: The company relies on maintenance and security deposits to offset potential customer credit losses. The inadequacy of these deposits could impact the company's cash position, depending of insurance recovery where applicable. Volatility in air travel demand, specifically on the short haul 14 January 2026 43 Barclays | North America Transportation Valuation Methodology and Risks

domestic routes using the CFM56 engine, could impact demand for aircraft and engine leasing within FTAI's aviation segment. FTAI maintains and internationally diverse fleet of aircraft and engines where can be subject to specific geopolitical risks in discrete countries and/or regions. GXO Logistics, Inc. (GXO / GXO)

Valuation Methodology: We value GXO shares at $58, based on an 8.5x EV/EBITDA on our 2027 EBITDA forecast of $1.0bn. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Apart from general macro-economic concerns, we see GXO risks specific to customer exposure across North America and Europe. While historical retention rates have been around 93% for the company, there is no guarantee future renewal rates will remain at these levels. Further, competition in the global contract logistics sector is intense. Future higher capital spending requirements and or pricing pressure could develop as a result, challenging future GXO margin and cash flow outcomes. GXO acquisitions are subject to regulatory review in home nations, which could impose conditions limiting the ability of GXO to drive margin improvement. Acceleration in volumes above historical levels could drive outsized earnings accretion. Heartland Express, Inc. (HTLD / HTLD)

Valuation Methodology: We value Heartland Express (HTLD) shares at $9 based on an EV multiple of 3.0x our 2027 EBITDA estimate of $0.2bn averaged with a 23.5x P/E multiple on our 2027 EPS estimate of $0.38. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Risks specific to Heartland Express: Future industry capacity growth could limit Heartland's ability to pass along cost inflation via price increases, including potential future fuel price increases. A shortage in available drivers could limit Heartland's ability to fully utilize the company's tractor fleet, potentially negatively impacting earnings. Changes to government safety and driver hours of service regulations could materially impact Heartland's future productivity and revenue generation potential.

Significant capital expenditures and/or acquisitions are required to maintain revenue levels, and supply chain fluidity and the ability to effect M&A is not guaranteed. Acceleration in the truckload rate environment could generate outsize profits, which would attract investors to the shares. Continued improvement in the operating ratio of acquired companies could improve returns to shareholders. Reduction in trucking supply could drive rates higher, improving Heartland's earnings profile. Hub Group Inc. (HUBG / HUBG)

Valuation Methodology: We value HUBG shares at $48, which is based on an average of 8.5x EV/EBITDA and 19.0x P/E multiples on our 2027 EBITDA forecast of $0.3bn and our 2027 EPS forecast of $2.60, respectively. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Risks specific to Hub Group: Consistent price increases from regional duopolistic railroads can drive cost inflation that may not be able to be passed through to customers in more challenging macroeconomic environments Improvements in autonomous trucking technologies could threaten the value proposition of rail intermodal relative to over-the-road transportation options JB Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT / JBHT)

Valuation Methodology: We value JBHT shares at $200, which is based on an average of 10.5x EV/EBITDA and 24.0x P/E multiples on our 2027 EBITDA forecast of $1.9bn and our 2027 EPS forecast of $8.30. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Risks specific to J.B. Hunt: Future railroad negotiations could result in materially higher purchased transportation expense for J.B. Hunt. Fuel price declines could erode modal competitiveness within the company's intermodal franchise, creating potential earnings pressure. Future industry capacity growth could limit J.B. Hunt's ability to pass along cost inflation via price increases, including potential future fuel price increases. Management's capital expenditure program could drive above average

growth in intermodal at strong returns, supporting the shares. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings (KNX / KNX)

Valuation Methodology: We value KNX shares at $65 based on an EV multiple of 7.5x our 2027 EBITDA estimate of $1.6bn averaged with a P/E multiple of 20.0x our 2027 EPS estimate of $3.30. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Risks specific to Knight Transportation: Future industry capacity growth could limit Knight's ability to pass along cost inflation via price increases, including potential future fuel price increases. A shortage in available drivers could limit Knight's ability to fully utilize the company's tractor fleet, potentially negatively impacting earnings. Changes to government safety and driver hours of service regulations could materially impact Knight's future productivity and revenue generation potential. Landstar System, Inc. (LSTR / LSTR)

Valuation Methodology: Our LSTR price target is $155, which is based on an average of 16.0x EV/EBITDA on our 2027 EBITDA forecast of $0.3bn and 26.5x P/E on our 2027 EPS forecast of $5.90. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies’ earnings can be exposed to risks from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Increasing competition in the truck brokerage and forwarding markets could lead to lower gross revenue margins and profit erosion. Equity valuation multiples could continue to compress, limiting share price appreciation. Reduction in truckload rates could reduce sourcing costs, improving gross margins in a contraction cycle and making the shares attractive to investors seeking an alternative to asset-based transportation equities. The company's unique business model effectively 14 January 2026 44 Barclays | North America Transportation

Valuation Methodology and Risks precludes M&A at scale, which could allow competitors to grow faster. The US government, including the department of defense, is a major customer, which could be attractive in contracting consumer demand environment, but also presents a risk in the event of interruption or a reduction in scope of government operations. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC / NSC)

Valuation Methodology: Our NSC price target of $340 is based on the average of applying a 24.5x P/E multiple on our 2027 EPS estimate of $13.85 and a 15.0x EV/EBITDA multiple on our 2027 EBITDA estimate of $6.1bn. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions, and operational challenges, among other things. Norfolk Southern is particularly export to domestic and export coal consumption, declines in which could materially impair earnings. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (ODFL / ODFL)

Valuation Methodology: We value ODFL shares at $165 based on an EV multiple of 16.5x on our 2027 EBITDA estimate of $2.0bn averaged with a P/E multiple of 27.5x on our 2027 EPS estimate of $6.00. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Risks specific to Old Dominion: Future industry capacity growth could limit Old Dominion's ability to pass along cost inflation via price increases, including potential future fuel price increases. Further, improvement in peer service could reduce Old Dominion's ability to charge above market pricing. A shortage in available drivers could limit Old Dominion's ability to fully utilize the company's tractor fleet, potentially negatively impacting earnings. Changes to government safety and driver hours of service

regulations could materially impact Old Dominion's future productivity and revenue generation potential. Formal organization of labor could increase labor cost and reduce operational flexibility, reducing operating margins. Old Dominion's service superiority could drive market share shift, increasing earnings above our estimates. Reduced investor appetite for risk could improve relative investor sentiment for higher quality transportation companies, including Old Dominion, increasing the relative trading multiple on future earnings in comparison to peers. RXO, Inc. (RXO / RXO)

Valuation Methodology: We value RXO shares at $15, based on a 13.5x EV/EBITDA multiple on our 2027 EBITDA forecast of $0.2bn. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Increasing competition in the truck brokerage market could lead to lower gross revenue margins and profit erosion. Equity valuation multiples could continue to compress, limiting share price appreciation. Reduction in truckload rates could reduce sourcing costs, improving gross margins in a contraction cycle and making the shares attractive to investors seeking an alternative to asset-based transportation equities. Further, management has a history of accretive M&A, which if executed in the future would make shares more attractive to investors. Ryder System, Inc. (R / R)

Valuation Methodology: We value Ryder shares at $220 using an average of 5.5x EV/EBITDA multiple on our 2027 EBITDA forecast of $3.1bn and 13.0x multiple on our 2027 EPS forecast of $16.85. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies’ earnings can be exposed to risks from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. Increasing competition in the new and used truck leasing and maintenance markets could lead to lower pre-tax margins and profit erosion. Weakness in the used trucking market would reduce gains on sale and could potentially be a drag on asset utilization. Equity valuation multiples could continue to compress, limiting share price appreciation. A reduction in consumer goods demand would reduce warehousing throughput, impacting contract logistics throughput and reducing cross sell for

other value add services. Further, management has a history of accretive M&A, which if executed in the future could make shares more attractive to investors. A change in the tariff on truck and truck parts could impact pricing and customers' preference for Ryder's leasing and rental offerings. Saia, Inc. (SAIA / SAIA)

Valuation Methodology: We value SAIA shares at $380 based on an EV multiple of 12.5x on our 2027 EBITDA estimate of $0.8bn averaged with a P/E multiple of 27.0x on our 2027 EPS estimate of $14.00.

Risks specific to SAIA: Future industry capacity growth could limit SAIA's ability to pass along cost inflation via price increases, including potential future fuel price increases. Further, improvement in peer service could reduce SAIA's ability to charge above market pricing. A shortage in available drivers could limit SAIA's ability to fully utilize the company's tractor fleet, potentially negatively impacting earnings. Changes to government safety and driver hours of service regulations could materially impact SAIA's

future productivity and revenue generation potential. Formal organization of labor could increase labor cost and reduce operational flexibility, reducing operating margins. Union Pacific Corp. (UNP / UNP) Valuation Methodology: Our UNP price target of $285 is based on the average of applying a 21.0x P/E multiple on our 2027 EPS estimate of $13.60 and a 14.0x EV/EBITDA multiple on our 2027 EBITDA estimate of $14.0bn. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, 14 January 2026 45 Barclays | North America Transportation Valuation Methodology and Risks labor disputes, weather disruptions, and operational challenges, among other things.

Reduction in trucking supply could drive rates higher, improving Werner's earnings profile.. XPO, Inc. (XPO / XPO) Valuation Methodology: We value XPO shares at $160, based on a 13.5x EV/EBITDA on our 2027 EBITDA forecast of $1.6bn. Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Investing in transportation companies can be risky. In addition to macroeconomic risks, the companies' earnings can be exposed to risk from changing geopolitical conditions, changing fuel prices, labor disputes, weather disruptions and operational challenges, among other things. XPO relies on service to win market share. The perception of a degradation in service would likely drive volume and potentially revenue contraction.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence

as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
