Earnings Revised - January 26, 2026

TOST reports 2/12. Based on management's track record of execution, we believe TOST can print another 4Q beat and expect initial '26 guide to be in line with 3Q25 commentary. We believe this would be positive for shares. Shares have underperformed since very strong 3Q print. We believe this is primarily due to debates around penetration of core SMB restaurant TAM & competition dynamics, and anti-software sentiment. However, on 12/3, TOST said that core net location adds should be similar in '26 as in '25, and that core net adds will continue to be + for years to come. We think this is supported by ample white space from non-integrated legacy systems, TOST's best-in-class platform, & an effective salesforce.

Anticipate 4Q upside, which could help shares. Based on management's track record of execution, we believe TOST can print another 4Q beat. WFSe 4Q GPV of 23.0% is above Street at 20.6%. WFSe recurring GP of $488M (+24.6% y/y) is in line with guide of $480M-$490M (+22-25%) and below Street at $493M (+25.7%). WFSe adj. EBITDA of $148M is in line with guide of $140M-$150M, and below Street at $151M. We believe a clean/solid overall print and upbeat mgmt commentary could be positive for shares.

Initial '26 guide expected to be in line with 3Q25 commentary, 1Q26 ests seem reasonable. We expect TOST to put a finer point to the ">20%" growth in recurring GP previewed for '26, with WFS/Street at 20.9%/22.3% (Exhibit 1). TOST also disclosed that '26 adj. EBITDA margins are expected to be flat/up, due to growth investments. WFS/ Street at ~150bps margin expansion, reflecting traditional mgmt conservatism. Street 1Q26 recurring GP/adj. EBITDA margin estimates of 20.6%/32.8% seem reasonable.

4Q consensus net adds look reasonable: Street 4Q net new location adds of 7.1K seem achievable and implies 29.1K in '25, up vs. 28K in '24, consistent with guide. TOST expects to increase total net new location adds in '26 again (L-T target of 500K), which we believe will be reiterated. Expect Toast Capital GP to be ~10bps of GPV for '25. Expect SaaS ARPU growth to remain in the mid-single-digits for the near term. We slightly tweak our '25 recurring GP estimates, to $1,873M from $1,859M prior.

Our $47 PT is based on 11.5x '26E recurring GP (vs. historical average of 13x) and DCF (11% WACC, 3.5% terminal growth) given robust execution and growth, as well as solid execution on newer growth markets.

4Q25 earnings Strong restaurant spending data points

We are Overweight on Toast. TOST's ingredients as the leading restaurant point-of-sale provider yields an attractive combo of growth + profitability. We believe TOST has room to increase its high-teens penetration in its core US SMB restaurant market and are encouraged by execution to date against TAM expansion efforts in enterprise, int'l, and food/beverage retail, which should drive upside potential to 2H estimates.

*As of 01/23/26 Source: Wells Fargo Securities, LLC estimates and Factset.

Upside to our PT would be driven by fasterthan-anticipated same-store-sales growth in SMB restaurants or faster uptake of newer growth markets. In this case, our upside price target is $56, which reflects a 14x C26E EV/GP multiple and our DCF.

Toast is a cloud-based, end-to-end platform providing software, hardware, and financial technology purpose-built for the restaurant industry. Toast currently serves 148,000 restaurant locations globally in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, and Australia. Toast offers software modules for the front and back of the house, with integrated payment processing. In '24, Toast processed $159B in GPV, $1.42B in recurring Subscription and FinTech Solutions GP, and $373M of adj. EBITDA. Downside to our PT could be driven by slowing restaurant SSS trends, slower adoption of newer products, and weaker credit trends than anticipated. In this case, our downside price target is $35, reflecting a 9x C26E EV/GP and our DCF. Exhibit 1 - TOST WFS vs. Consensus - 4Q25e/1Q26e/2025e/2026e

Downside risks include: 1) slowing restaurant same-store-sales growth, impacting Toast's GPV growth and net new location adds, 2) increasing competition potentially lowering Toast's take rate, 3) slower adoption of newer Toast products, which results in slower ARPU growth, 4) increased credit risk from Toast Capital
