"The 411 on 911" (4Q25) | Friends Don't Let Friends Use Taser 7 Anymore

We initiated on AXON & MSI in Sep-2025, and recently upgraded MSI. Inputs this quarter point to relatively inline bookings prints for both. There are a few notable callouts from our work this quarter: 1) There were decent mentions for drone security in some of the contracts we parsed through that could further help bookings; 2) Axon has mentioned to multiple customers the end-of-support for Taser 7, which could further help renewals (including with LAPD), and most importantly, the upcoming 2026 guide and 3-year outlook; 3) MSI's likely bookings gives confidence in management's initial ~$12.6B outlook given last quarter. Both represent investment opportunities, in our view, with debate around the January potential shutdown, new geopolitical and ICE conflicts, and rise in the US Defense budget rhetoric picking up over the last few weeks. See our takes from our Public Safety day here.

· Axon | Downloads & Traffic: Web traffic and unique monthly visitors of Evidence.com each accelerated, and while against easy compares, the magnitude is fairly impressive. App downloads and job-postings are less correlated to bookings, though each showed a slowdown (especially downloads). We believe the job posting slowdown has more to do with the recent acquisitions that should bring in ~350 new employees (which is about the prior and current level of postings anyways). Inputs point to ~$3.4B in FQ4 bookings, which would put the year in the mid-30s.

· Axon EoS of Taser 7?: Axon notably has a large amount of renewals in Q4 and upcoming, but what makes this most interesting, some of the renewals called out that Axon has advised customers that it will no longer support Taser 7 after December 31, 2025 as it transitions to Taser 10. Additionally, the high volume of Taser 7 sales in the cohort coming up for renewal could act as a force multiplier for Taser 10 sales, such as the LAPD, with more than 7k CEDs (Taser 7). Axon won a $4.4M Body Cam & Evidence Mgmt with the US Marshal Service. Axon also won a drone contract that got rescinded from Brinc as the fulfillment was taking too long. On a S&L level, Axon won a $41M / 9-yr renewal with Cincinnati PD (including $4.8M of Skydio) and $13M / 10-yr renewal with Fargo PD (including drone-as-first responders).

· Motorola Solutions | Traffic, Postings, Notable Wins: Total website traffic grew 21% in Q4 and exited at ~30%, while portal traffic accelerated again (easier compare) to 8% Y/Y. Job postings also were up strongly in Q4 and December specifically. Inputs point to $3.9-$4B in bookings vs. $3.94B estimate MSI won a $586K deal with NASA for networkservice, $517K with Dept. of VA, $7M with Kerr County, TX for emergency radio system modernization, and $1.9M with Reno for drone-as-a-first responder.

· Local Agency Spotlight | LAPD: This quarter, we're highlighting the Los Angeles Police Department (~9k sworn-officers vs. ~9,500 five years ago). The LAPD's primary Axon contract for CEDs and Body is set to expire in mid-2026, with a potential for early renewal at any point. The contract initially consisted of Taser 7 and Body 3, with Fleet 3 units added in 2022. LA is of course in focus given the major scheduled events (World Cup & Summer Olympics) there over the next few years. LAPD will play a major role in these events, but has billed the Olympics as a 'no-cost' event for the city. The initial contract was ~$50M over 5 years (Taser and Body Cams), which given the OSP upgrades, AIofferings, and need for drone security, our framework implies at a 20% volume-based discount a potential ~$150-$175M range for this net-renewal could be feasible.

Government spending, public safety events, tax funding, macroeconomic, IT spending, competition, ASPs, and valuations.

Evidence.com web-traffic was +23% Y/Y (vs. -1% LQ) with unique monthly +23% y/y (vs +9% LQ). App Downloads showed further weakness from last quarter down 94% Y/Y (vs. -20% Y/Y LQ) pointing to a greater mix of renewal/expansion vs. new customer bookings. Job posting were down but recently acquired carbyne and prepared with total headcount of ~350. Inputs point to ~$3.4B of bookings.

Website traffic accelerated on a Y/Y basis to +21% (vs 18% LQ), exiting the quarter +28% Y/Y for December. Customer Portal traffic recovered to +8% Y/Y (vs. -25% LQ) and similarly exited strong (+29% Y/Y in December). The average of both traffic methods points to ~$3.9-$4B of bookings.

Both Axon and Motorola has unsurprisingly quiet quarters on the Federal side given the general seasonality seen with Fed awards. In state and local, Axon showed strength in renewals and expansions, with many renewing agencies adding drone products.

'In 2020,5 City Council authorized the City Manager, or their designee, to execute purchase orders with Axon for the purchase of Taser 7 Evidence.com access software subscription licenses and Taser 7 CEWs, including related accessories, training, and installation as required (Agreement for Tasers). The Agreement for Tasers is set to expire on December 2, 2025. Meanwhile, Axon has advised the City that it will no longer support Taser 7 after December 31, 2025, because it is transitioning to Taser 10.' - - San Jose Contract Amendment Memo Upgrading to TASER 10 (10/10/2025) Given the 5 year useful life of the TASER product (which aligns with the most common Axon contract length), upgrades from TASER 7 to TASER 10 are likely to be elevated from 4Q25 through 4Q26 as we lap the most elevated quarters of TASER 7 unit-sales volume. Further pressure from an 'end of support' of the older model would be an additional tailwind.

The LAPD main Axon contract for CEDs and BWCs (body worn cameras) is set to expire mid-2026, with potential for early renewal anytime up to that date. With the major events scheduled to take place in Los Angeles over the next few years (Summer Olympics in '28 & World Cup matches in 2026), we see the potential for upgrades and early renewal to the LAPD contract.

OSP7 Contract: Expires mid-2026  CEDs - 7530 Taser 7 devices (2021)  BWCs - 7355 Body Cam 3 devices (2021) Fleet 3 Contract: Expires mid-2027  1500 installed units (2022)

LA28 has billed the Olympics as a 'no-cost' event for LA, with the LAPD a major part of the security. Given the limited headcount of LAPD, the city will likely seek to increase the policing power of each officer via increased technology investment, a trend already being seen in LA over the last few year.
