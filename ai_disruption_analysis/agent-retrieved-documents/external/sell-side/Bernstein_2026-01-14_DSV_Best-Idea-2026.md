Alex Irving, CFA +44 20 7676 7044 alex.irving@bernsteinsg.com Antoine Madre +33 1 58 98 74 52 antoine.madre@bernsteinsg.com DSV is our top pick in European Transport, and in our view the only stock investors need to own in European Logistics. Despite a strong run in Q4 (+26%), we do not believe investors have missed their opportunity to buy. This year brings two important catalysts. First, the May 12 CMD, at which management will likely lay out 2030 targets. That requires a call on some of the incremental opportunities beyond the DKK 9bn guided synergies, and we see a strong probability this comes in ahead of what is currently priced in. Second, H2 may see buybacks restart, providing further EPS accretion and pushing numbers up. We roll our model ahead of FY results in 3 weeks, and raise our TP to DKK 2,150 (25% upside).

Crunch time: 2026 is the year synergies get de-risked, or missed. The integration of DB Schenker is progressing at pace. Headcount is already falling, and many of the group's largest countries have gone live with the integration. The CEO's office is likely already moving on to the next leg of the equity story, as local countries with decentralized P&L responsibility manage change on the ground. By the end of 2026, we should be able to conclude one of two things: either 1) synergies are de-risked, or 2) the integration has gone wrong. The tone from Denmark suggests scenario 1 to be considerably more likely.

Catalyst 1: Open-the-curtain CMD. DSV hosts its first CMD in 4 years on May 12. We expect targets for 2030 profitability, where we see a good chance of them coming in above what is discounted in current valuations. Importantly, management will need to make a call on several possible opportunities that are not formally part of the existing DKK 9bn synergy guide. Can road margins hit 10%? Can Air & Sea conversion get to 60%? How large is the AI opportunity? All to be answered in 4 months' time, none with much credit in numbers or valuations today.

Catalyst 2: Return of the buyback. DSV has long had a simple capital allocation policy: leverage below 2x, then M&A if attractive deals exist, then buybacks. That 2x leverage soft ceiling was in part to keep the credit rating at A-/A3, which it has had since 2020 and 2021 respectively. We understand that management is making the case for a lower risk profile assessment, which would permit buybacks to resume above 2x leverage without a rating downgrade. If successful, H2 2026 could see buybacks restart. We currently model this for 2027, with buybacks rising to DKK 24bn p.a. (~6% of market cap) by 2028.

In line on Q4. DSV reports Q4 results on February 4. Our EBIT estimate is in line with consensus. The guide for 2026 likely ends up around the consensus range of DKK 25bn; we are at DKK 24bn on an assumption of higher volume churn in Air & Sea as the integration bites, and former employees find roles at competitors. If DSV has continued to achieve minimal churn by mid-year, we will concede this point. Rolling model, raising TP to DKK 2,150. DSV had a strong run in Q4, returning 26%. It reports FY 25 results on February 4, and we roll our valuation year today for a clearer picture of where we see fundamental fair value. Historically DSV has traded at 20x FY2 P/E; we discount the multiple by 1 turn for M&A execution risk, and value at 19x 2028 earnings with a new TP of DKK 2,150.

DSV is the world's largest freight forwarder, and is in the middle of integrating its latest acquisition, DB Schenker. Management has a track record of flawless execution in previous M&A deals, and we expect the same again here. Current valuation levels, in our analysis, suggest that synergy targets, organic growth, or both, fall well short of expectations. We take the opposite view: that if anything, the DKK9bn guide is likely to prove conservative, as the group captures incremental sources of upside from ocean yields, further benefits on air and sea margins, or road margins, and that underlying organic growth of around 4% should be about right. 2026 brings two important catalyst opportunities, and DSV is our top pick in European Transport.

M&A masters. Just over 20 years ago, few outside the logistics industry or specializing in Danish stocks knew who DSV was. Since then, from a Nordic road freight forwarding specialist with a market cap of DKK 4bn (c. $600m), the company has transformed itself into one of the largest global airfreight and seafreight forwarders through a string of well-executed, highlyaccretive acquisitions that saw revenues 10x, EBIT 20x, and the stock return >1000%. The company is now the world's largest freight forwarder. Prior M&A deals have marked inflection points in DSV's EPS growth: we expect the same again.

Guided synergies overly discounted... DSV has guided an initial DKK9bn cost synergies from its acquisition and integration of DB Schenker. Add mid single digit underlying EBIT growth, and that comfortably suggests triple-digit EPS (BERNe: DKK 112) when integration completes in 2028. With shares typically trading at around 20x FY2 earnings, a path to DKK 2,000+ is becoming clearer; the more synergies become de-risked, the more likely we see investors willing to value the company closer to historic multiples. Current valuations suggest DSV's synergies and organic growth to 2028 disappoint. We see this judgment as too pessimistic, for a management team with a stellar 20-year track record in M&A integration.

… And may even be conservative. DSV's initial DKK 9bn number is only the initial steer on synergy, and we see this as representing a number that management is very confident in achieving. There are further sources of upside. First, in gross profit on ocean yields, as DSV insources logistics value-added work currently outsourced to third parties, and may see this rising to the upper 4,000s. Second, the possibility of air and sea conversion margins reaching towards 60%, as management has suggested may be possible towards the end of the decade. Third, a possibility for road EBIT margins to hit double digits: the largest incremental source of further profitability. Not in our numbers, nor in guidance, but with a non-zero chance of realizing. The company, and the freight forwarding industry more broadly, also has an opportunity to drive value creation through the deployment of AI to reduce costs and improve pricing.

Catalyst 1: CMD. DSV hosts its first CMD in four years this May, and once again we will be in Hedehusene for the show. The CMD should provide management's answers to how achievable the incremental sources of upside discussed above are, and more generally sketch out the path to 2030. We expect this to give investors greater comfort around the earnings power of the group, and add a new leg to the investment case beyond the debate over Schenker synergies.

Catalyst 2: Buyback (maybe). DSV has historically had a three bullet point capital allocation policy: leverage below 2x, M&A if attractive opportunities exist, and buybacks if they don't. Management has discussed the possibility to restore buybacks as early as 2026. However, that would mean breaching the first principle. We expect the decision to be made with an eye on credit rating: DSV will likely seek to preserve is A-/A3 rating, and if agencies agree that the company's business risk is lower, they may bless a return of buybacks this year. We currently, more conservatively, model this happening in 2027.

The most important downside risk to a position in DSV is the merger going wrong. This is not yet a zero-probability event. WE see the biggest risk in the merger as cultural: if DSV is unable to manage change at the best business they have bought in a long time, and keep employees on board, this could see former Schenker people resist the integration and derail synergies. This is not our base case: the tone from Denmark has been encouraging, and DSV understands integration very well. By the end of 2026, this risk will be either realized or gone.

As discussed above, we are in line with sell side consensus for Q4 results on February 4. We are slightly behind in 2026 on our estimates of higher volume churn in the integration - which we see rising as employees leave the combined business and find employment elsewhere. More importantly, we can infer a buy-side consensus figure for 2028 earnings, and are around 30% ahead on EBIT for what looks to be priced in.

Globalization, Reborn: International Logistics Is Changed Forever (2025) A Twist of Freight: The Forces Reshaping Freight Forwarding (2022)

DSV: A freight with destiny - Mapping out the Schenker integration DSV: Best Idea Q4 2025 - Priced to disappoint on deal synergies, despite glowing track record; Outperform European Logistics: The top 10 analyses from our "Globalization, Reborn" Blackbook

DHL: Wait until a stronger macro recovery takes hold. Downgrade to Market-Perform, TP €42.8 DSV: How it's done, done, done. Outperform, TP DKK 1,800 Kuehne+Nagel: Will cost reductions put a floor under earnings? Remain Market-Perform, TP CHF 155 Maersk: Good quarter, but supply risks continue. Remain Underperform, TP DKK 10,700

DSV has continuously delivered both organic and inorganic total shareholder return. As a freight forwarder, more complex logistics demand provides a structural boost to the group's earnings potential. A laser focus on cost has seen margins expand over the last decade, and its conversion ratio in air and sea, post-synergy, should stand some 20%pt above closest peer Kuehne+Nagel. With the May 2025 acquisition of DB Schenker, DSV became the world's largest freight forwarder - and arguably the world's largest 3PL. A defensive, asset-light business model that results in resilient earnings even in an economic slowdown. The future looks bright.

· M&A masters strike again. Just over 20 years ago, few outside the logistics industry or specializing in Danish stocks knew who DSV was . Since then, from a Nordic road freight forwarding specialist with a market cap of DKK 4bn (c. $600m), the company has transformed itself into one of the largest global airfreight and seafreight forwarders through a string of wellexecuted, highly-accretive acquisitions . The DB Schenker acquisition saw the Danes finally claiming the title of the largest freight forwarder in the world. Prior M&A deals have marked inflection points in DSV's EPS growth : we expect the same again with its latest, largest deal.

· Rolling up their sleeves and diving into the integration. DSV closed on its acquisition of DB Schenker in Q2 2025. This is a significant opportunity for another earnings inflection. The basic playbook remains the same : align organizational architecture structures, replatform IT infrastructure, fully allocate costs to the local businesses, and manage up labor productivity and the conversion margin. But there is so much more to play for. The most exciting incremental opportunity is arguably in Road , where the combined business may have the potential making of a scale European LTL play, and Schenker's IT infrastructure can be brought to bear to enhance pre-deal DSV's efficiency. Management suggested double-digit EBIT margins may be possible: once again breaking new ground. Our estimates suggest at least DKK 110 of EPS postsynergy in 2028, more than double the DKK 50 (underlying) it achieved in 2024.

· On the road to 50%+ conversion margin in Air & Sea. DSV has long had the best conversion margins among freight forwarders , and the conversion ratio is the group's North Star: targeted, protected and prioritized. The group had a 2026 target for an Air & Sea conversion margin >50% by 2026, which represents new ground for what may be possible in this business, and even hit it in Q3 2024 before taking on additional cost to prepare for the Schenker deal. Once the integration completes, we expect conversion margins to permanently and meaningfully exceed 50%. Under a blue-sky scenario, on DSV's long-term trajectory, this could approach 60% by the end of the decade. Too early to credit this yet, but DSV has long got better as it has got bigger.

Recommendation: Outperform Target price 12 (Months): DKK 2,150 (28% upside)

Roll model to treat 2028 as FY+2, value at 19x P/E (inclusive of 1x discount for execution risk on M&A vs 20x historic average multiple)

· Delivery on synergy targets. Valuations, in our analysis, substantially undervalue post-synergy earnings, with less than half of the guided synergies priced in . Over the next 12 months, the uncertainty will go. DSV will either successfully realize synergies, or fail at this integration. We expect the former, leading to a re-rating. · CMD with path to higher medium-term earnings growth. DSV's initial synergy guide may prove to be conservative. The CMD on May 12 will provide an ideal forum to take medium-term earnings guidance higher. Some of this may be additional improvment to Schenker earnings, some self-help (e.g. technology / AI). · Restoration of share buyback. DSV has suspended the buyback as it delevers from the Schenker acquisition. With rating agency blessing, buybacks could resume as early as H2 2026.

· A failure to realize significant cost synergy from the DB Schenker deal and higher volume churn · Cultural resistance among former DB Schenker employees to changes to processes: this is a better asset than prior deals, magnifying that risk · Weaker trade growth · Lower supply chain complexity

The first major catalyst for 2026 is set to be the company's Capital Markets Day, scheduled for May 12. The last CMD was in April 2022, just as the pandemic-era logistics boom was coming to an end. We expect the CMD to be far more than a mere update on the integration of DB Schenker and a confirmation of or change to synergy targets. Notably, we will be watching for signs around incremental sources of earnings upside that did not form part of the initial synergy guide from the Schenker merger. These are especially meaningful around margins: if either Road EBIT margins could reach double-digit levels, or Air & Sea conversion margins could reach 60%, both would represent upside to our forecasts. Finally, we expect DSV to provide greater detail around its AI strategy, and see the company's scale and well-structured data as likely to position it well to win in the industry-wide adoption of AI.

· Several opportunities beyond Schenker synergies: which ones are achievable? The big story of 2025 was the DKK 9bn synergy target from the DB Schenker acquisition, which positively surprised the market when it was announced. However, this is only part of the earnings improvement. It is a 'spreadsheet' number prepared before the merger, and relates only to the consolidation of operations, logistics facilities, back-office functions, finance and IT infrastructure. More stretching or uncertain targets are not included. That includes any reduction in procurement costs, more uncertain profitability goals (e.g. 10% EBIT margin in Road) and decisions not yet made (e.g. possible migration to an in-house transport management system for Air & Sea). The CMD will likely provide direction on all these opportunities, and management's view on their chances of success.

· How profitable can DSV get? Our DKK 36.3bn EBIT estimate for 2028 does not include these incremental opportunities, but rather works out to the DKK 9bn synergy number with 4% annual organic growth over the 4-year period from 2024 to 2028. The biggest idiosyncratic opportunities are around margins, and DSV has in the past hinted at a path to 10% EBIT margins in Road (c. DKK 3bn incremental opportunity) and possibly 60% conversion margin in Air & Sea (c. DKK 1bn incremental opportunity). Beyond this, an even larger driver would be if the world finally drags itself out of the long-lasting soft volume environment that has persisted since the end of the pandemic: each additional %pt of organic growth would be worth about another DKK 2bn EBIT on a business with those higher margins.

· Current share price continues to excessively discount earnings potential. To calculate what is priced in today for synergies from the deal, we begin with the current share price and DSV's own long-term (10y) valuation multiple of 20x FY +2 (rolling the model so FY+2 = 2028). That suggests post-synergy (2028) EPS of DKK 84. Multiplying by the share count, adding back tax and net interest get us to an implied EBIT in that year of DKK 27.8bn. In 2024, DSV's own EBIT was DKK 16.1bn, and DB Schenker's was DKK 6bn. The difference to the implied 2028 number is DKK5.7bn. We see a DKK 14bn improvement as more likely, based on the pro forma businesses, the minimum DKK 9bn of synergies, and c. 5% organic growth after the churn of Schenker business.

· AI: A blessing or curse? Expect to hear more and more about how forwarders are deploying AI, chiefly in service of cost reduction, but also around revenue generation. DSV is no exception - indeed, this was covered at the 2022 CMD - but likely has more time dedicated to it this year. Forwarding still has many manual, routine sub-processes that could be automated away. DSV's well-structured data and IT platforms will make this easier to deploy than in companies with more chaotic technology. The risk is that productivity gains are given away to customers in pursuit of higher market share. However, we expect market structure to provide an offset. Forwarding is a highly fragmented industry, and while scale forwarders will be able to bear upfront costs for group-wide productivity gains, smaller forwarders will likely find this more difficult. Even if DSV and other large forwarders use cost improvements to lower pricing in pursuit of market share, we would see the most likely outcome as a redistribution of industry profit away from the long

tail: net net, advantageous for the scale players.

The second catalyst we see for DSV this year is a potential return of share buybacks. At this early stage, our numbers are more conservative, envisioning a restoration of buybacks in 2027. The key deciding factor regarding whether buybacks restart looks to be credit considerations. DSV has had an A-/A3 rating since 2020/2021, and we understand is keen to preserve it. Restoring the buyback in 2026 would mean breaching a longstanding pillar of capital allocation: leverage below 2x before buybacks. Yet DSV has a credible argument that its business should be assessed as lower risk, with greater scale and higher margins than at the end of the 2010s. If the agencies agree, we could see buybacks return this year - pulling numbers higher.

· Longstanding simple capital allocation policy: leverage, M&A, buybacks. DSV's capital allocation policy as it has stood for over a decade, fits on the back of a beer mat. First, leverage below 2x net debt / EBITDA. Second, inorganic expansion where sufficiently attractive opportunities exist. Third, buybacks. The buyback is currently on hold as the company deleverages following the DB Schenker acquisition, and we expect it to fall below 2x in 2027.

· Could buybacks restart in 2026? We can see the logic - can the rating agencies? Management has been hinting increasingly strongly that it hopes to recommence buybacks as early as this year. Doing so would be ahead of consensus estimates, requiring EPS upgrades - indeed, we model buybacks restarting only in 2027, and leverage hitting 2.3x by the end of 2026. We understand management to have one eye on credit ratings in this decision, keen to preserve the A- rating it has had since 2020/2021. This would require the rating agencies to agree that DSV's risk profile is lower than when those ratings were set. A reasonable proposition in our view, given business volumes more than doubling, and conversion ratios in Air & Sea rising by c. 10%pt in the interim.

· About half of EPS growth comes from buybacks: restoring these matters. Once the merger is complete, in 2028, we see DSV achieving annual organic EBIT growth of 4-5%. That principally comes from the largest Air & Sea division, where we currently assume limited margin growth: breaking with the underlying improvement path that persisted from 2012 to 2025. As discussed above, that may be conservative, especially if DSV is able to use AI to improve unit economics and keep some of the gain. With some modest reduction in net leverage, that would mean net income growth of c. 5%. We model buybacks at our target price, which at DKK 24bn run-rate is another 5-6% EPS growth, bringing annual EPS growth above 10%. As synergy-driven EPS growth slows, buybacks will need to replace it.

We value DSV on 2028 (post-synergy) earnings, rolling the model ahead of FY results in 3 weeks' time. DSV has historically traded at 20x FY2 P/E, and we discount this by 1 turn for execution risk from the integration of DB Schenker for a multiple of 19x (previously 16.2x for an FY+3 valuation). This provides our new target price of DKK 2,150. We remain Outperform, top pick in European Transport.

We value DSV at DKK 2,150 using a P/E of 19.1x applied to our 2028 EPS. The greatest downside risks to our DSV target price: · Weaker trade growth · Lower supply chain complexity · Softer unit gross profits · A failure to realize significant synergies from the DB Schenker deal
