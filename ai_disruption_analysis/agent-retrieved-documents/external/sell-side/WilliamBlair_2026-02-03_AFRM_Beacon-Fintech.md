February 3, 2026

Alpha call. We encourage investors to increase exposure into Thursday's earnings report. We see Affirm as poised to beat consensus GMV, revenue, and EBIT as it extends buy now, pay later (BNPL) market leadership. Shares have been pressured recently by what we consider overstated credit and regulatory fears. We contend that BNPL is beyond the purview of a proposed credit card interest rate cap, and note that resulting restricted consumer credit would likely drive BNPL demand. We see Affirm aligned with the best e-Comm partners, including Shopify (SHOP $132.20; Outperform), Amazon (AMZN $242.96; Outperform), and Expedia (EXPE $276.67), and expect the company to deliver 20%-plus long-term organic revenue growth and 30%-plus EBIT compounding.

Strong momentum. Affirm has recently announced deals that bolster our long-term confidence: 1) an Amazon contract extension; 2) an extension of its Expedia relationship, in which it is the exclusive BNPL provider for lodging and packages; and 3) an exclusive Intuit QuickBooks integration offering BNPL to Intuit's millions of SMB customers. Lastly, the company announced an application to establish an industrial loan company. We are bullish on Affirm's ability to obtain a bank license as it should lower funding costs, offer insulation from secondary market volatility, and speed up product development.

Huge TAMs and share gains. We think new deals and growth at its largest partners will drive above-consensus 30%-plus fiscal 2026 GMV growth, and we see comparable fiscal 2027 growth as it spools up newer customers and takes wallet share. We note that Affirm's Shop Pay attach is less than 10%, and we think it has about 5% Amazon wallet share. These observations are in the context of $120 billion of U.S. BNPL volume versus an approximate $1.1 trillion eComm TAM and a nearly $8 trillion carded retail TAM. We anticipate that Affirm's move into the $1.1 trillion international TAM will bear fruit in second half fiscal 2026 or early 2027. We believe secular BNPL growth will offset potential short-term e-Comm volatility.

Short-term consumer liquidity is a key 2026 theme. Shares of short-term liquidity providers, like Affirm, Cash App (XYZ $60.40; Outperform), and Chime (CHYM $24.03; Outperform), have underperformed year-to-date as investors grapple with regulatory and consumer credit fears. It is our view that these worries are overblown given superior value proposition versus traditional banks, reasonable fees, strong data-driven underwriting and structural consumer demand. There are at least 185 million U.S. households living paycheck to paycheck, and these solutions address a structural need with fair, transparent solutions that are superior to credit cards.

Operating leverage. Despite some detractors focused on Affirm's nominal GAAP profitability, we highlight an outlook for 11.1 points of fiscal 2024-2026 EBIT margin expansion, and more importantly, an estimated $864 million of trailing 12-month FCF. This is almost 90% FCF conversion, and we see higher ROIC driving multiple expansion. Andrew W.

Stock thoughts and risks. We remain bullish on Affirm shares, which trade at 16.8x estimated calendar 2027 EBITDA, which is now about a 6% premium to a group of fintech category killers that have seen about eight points of estimated P/E contraction over the last quarter as macro, competitive, and consumer credit fears have risen. We generally view this convergence as a sign of an impending bottom, particularly as the spread between the highest-valued names in the group, Figure (FIGR $52.31) and Robinhood (HOOD $89.91), has seen relative premiums roughly halved, to about 40%, during this period.

We believe Affirm will see significant long-term multiple expansion as it builds on leadership in a nascent BNPL industry and generates consistently above-average GMV, revenue, RLTC, EBIT, and FCF ROIC growth. Our FCF ROIC analysis suggests Affirm could command an approximate 20x 2027 EBITDA multiple, or a 20% premium to its current valuation and 27% higher than fintech category killers. This outlook supports $94, or more than 50% 12-month upside potential. Key risks include: credit risk, capital adequacy, funding and liquidity, loan mark assumptions, competition, regulatory scrutiny, and macro.
