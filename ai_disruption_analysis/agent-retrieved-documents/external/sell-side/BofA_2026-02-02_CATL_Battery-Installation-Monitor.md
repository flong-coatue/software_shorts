Price objective basis & risk CATL (CTATF) We derive our PO of HK$605 for CATL from the average of DCF and EV/EBITDA valuation. DCF valuation: A fair value of HK$609 is derived from our DCF calculation, with assumptions of 2% free-cashflow (FCF) perpetual growth and 12.4% weighted average cost of capital (WACC). For WACC, we use 1.1x equity beta, 3.0% risk-free rate and 12% market return, to calculate and derive the discount rate (WACC) of 12.4%. EV/EBITDA valuation: A fair value of HK$601 is derived from 18x target EV/EBITDA over its 2026E EBITDA, largely in-line with the average of global leading manufacturing companies. Risks: (1) slower-than-expected EV sales growth, (2) raw material price hikes, (3) market share loss due to fierce competition, (4) uncertainties and risks in overseas manufacturing and operations, and (5) foreign exchange rate fluctuations, (6) US tariff uncertainties.

CATL (H) Local share at 4 8 % in Dec ; Feb prod . plan at -10 % MoM According to RealLi, CATL ' s installed battery capacity (at cell level) in Dec in China was 50.6 GWh, up 50 % YoY. Its domestic market share was 4 7.9 % in Dec , up 2.4 ppt Y oY / 4.6 ppt MoM . CATL ' s top Chinese clients in Dec were Geely/Tesla/Changan , accounting for 1 0 %/ 9 %/9% of its installed battery capacity in China. According to our supply chain check, CATL ' s planned production is estimated to be 68.0 GWh in Feb , up 4 0 % YoY/ down 10 % MoM , which looks resilient to us, considering the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday in Feb. We believe batter y demand from commercial vehicle and ESS remains strong, which should support CATL ' s battery shipment in 1Q26. We have a Buy rating on CATL.

CATL (H) Launch es Tianxing II battery for light commercial vehicles On 22 Jan, CATL launched the Tianxing II light commercial vehicle battery series. The Tianxing II battery includes four variants : 1) f ast- c harging v ersion , which enables battery charging from 20% to 80% in 30 minutes under -15 ° C temperature, and it improves battery cell cycle life by 10% to 8 , 000 cycles ; 2) l ong- r ange v ersion , which deploys battery pack capacity of 253kWh, achieving a maximum range of 800k m; 3) h igh- t emperature f ast- c harging v ersion , which supports 4C rate fast charging, enabling 10km range within 1 minute charging. The new technology also helps battery pack maintains stable fast-charging performance and battery life in high-temperature environments ; 4) low-temperature sodium-ion version : t he 45kWh sodium-ion battery allows for immediate charging even when completely frozen at -30 ° C , eliminating the winter operation challenges faced by commercial vehicles in cold regions.

In addition, CATL also unveiled Tianxing II swappable battery versions, which include three battery packs options: 20#-42kWh, 25#-56kWh , and 35#-81kWh , covering all light commercial vehicles.
