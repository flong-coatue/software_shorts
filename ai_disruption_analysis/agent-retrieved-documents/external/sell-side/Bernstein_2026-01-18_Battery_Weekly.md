· EV sales in the US plummet - as expected - electrive.com. According to figures from Kelley Blue Book, electric vehicle sales in the US declined by two per cent to 1,275,714 units in 2025. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the quarter following the end of the nationwide tax credit, electric vehicle sales dropped by 36 per cent to 234,171 units.

· Ford in talks to use BYD batteries abroad, triggering backlash - BloombergNEF. Ford Motor Co. is in talks with China's BYD Co. about potentially supplying batteries for hybrid vehicles to the American automaker's overseas factories, according to people familiar with the negotiations, drawing political pushback in the US. BYD, the world's top seller of electric vehicles, is among several battery suppliers Ford is talking to, said the people, who asked not to be identified revealing internal discussions. No deal is imminent, they said. The discussions are aimed at supplying Ford's international factories with batteries for the automaker's expanding line of hybrids, the people said. The hybrids built in Ford's overseas factories would be exported worldwide, including to the US, the people said. But most hybrids Ford sells in the US would continue to come from factories in North America.

· Germany to hand EV buyers up to €6,000 a car to boost demand - BloombergNEF. Germany is set to start a major subsidy program for electric vehicles worth €3 billion ($3.5 billion), renewing efforts to push sales and support one of its key industries. The fresh round of funding, first outlined in October, is enough for about 800,000 cars, according to Environment Minister Carsten Schneider. The program targets low- to middle income households and is set to benefit the likes of Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV that are rolling out a broader range of affordable vehicles. The government will provide subsidies through 2029 of between €1,500 and €6,000 depending on the vehicle and a family's size and earnings, Schneider told Bild newspaper Friday.

· Volvo Cars puts battery cell subsidiary Novo Energy into hibernation - electrive.com. Originally, Novo Energy was set to begin producing battery cells this year at a new facility in Gothenburg, Sweden, whose construction began in September 2023. Novo Energy had announced plans to produce up to 50 GWh per year, not only to supply battery cells for Volvo's European plants in Gothenburg and the Belgian city of Ghent but also potentially for other brands within the Chinese Geely Group (to which Volvo Cars belongs.) However, it has long been clear that these plans would not come to fruition, at least for the time being. The insolvency of Northvolt and the subsequent complete takeover of Novo Energy by Volvo left the Swedish carmaker without a suitable technology partner to operate the cell factory.

· China, EU agree to bring in minimum pricing for Chinese EVs to replace high tariffs - Yicai. After multiple rounds of consultations to implement the consensus reached at the China-EU summit, the two sides agreed it is necessary to provide general guidance on minimum pricing for Chinese exporters of BEVs to the EU, China's commerce ministry said. In October 2024, the European Commission imposed additional import duties of as much as 35.3 percent on Chinese EVs for five years on top of the existing 10 percent standard car import tariff. In comparison, the rate for Tesla is 7.8 percent.

- · China's power grid investments to surge to record $574 billion in 2026-2030 - Reuters. China's State Grid will spend 4 trillion yuan ($574 billion) to upgrade the country's power grid between 2026 and 2030, state-run Xinhua news agency said on Thursday. That is a 40% jump in fixed-asset investments from the previous five-year period, according to the report by Xinhua, as China ramps up wind and 19 January 2026 solar capacity to meet its goal of peaking its carbon emissions by 2030. It works out to an average 800 billion yuan in investment per year - topping the record 650 billion yuan that the country's main national grid operator invested in 2025.

· China's Ronbay bags USD17.2 billion lithium battery materials order from CATL - Yicai. Ronbay New Energy Technology said it has secured an order for lithium-iron phosphate cathode materials worth CNY120 billion (USD17.2 billion) from CATL. Ronbay will provide 3.05 million tons of LFP cathode materials to CATL's factories in China and related services starting this quarter through 2030. Following the announcement, the Shanghai Stock Exchange requested Ronbay to provide additional explanations on how it would handle such a large order in 24 hours and to self-examine if the deal could lead to insider trading or other violations.

· Fulin Precision gains after CATL invests USD455 million in Chinese battery materials supplier - Yicai. Fulin Precision's shares rose after the Chinese supplier of raw materials for power batteries said CATL, the world's biggest maker of lithium batteries, will invest CNY3.2 billion (USD455 million) in the company, making it the second-largest shareholder. The funds will be allocated across several projects. More than CNY2.7 billion will be invested in lithium iron phosphate cathode materials. The LFP project investment will be undertaken by Shenghua New Material, a joint venture between CATL and Fulin Precision, which is 51 percent owned by CATL. Fulin Precision plans to inject CNY2.7 billion into a project company formed by Shenghua to manage construction and operation of a proposed new plant.

· Svolt unveils 'world's largest capacity' 80-kWh PHEV battery pack - CnEVPost. Svolt Energy has unveiled an 80-kWh battery pack for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), claiming it has the world's largest capacity. The Chinese battery manufacturer rolled out the Fortress 2.0 pack at its sixth Battery Day event in Changzhou, Jiangsu province on Tuesday, targeting family car segment. Its cells incorporate ultra-fast charging graphite technology, supporting peak charging rates of up to 6C, enabling a 10%-80% charge within 10 minutes. Svolt achieved its first quarterly profit in the fourth quarter 2025 and aims to reach full-year profitability in 2026, said Yang Hongxin, chairman and CEO of the Chinese power battery manufacturer. The company targets 61 GWh of battery shipments in 2026, representing a 50% increase from 2025, according to Yang.

· China overhauls battery rules as wave of electric clunkers looms - BloombergNEF. China announced new rules to track old car batteries to prevent them from being recycled illegally as the country faces a growing number of electric clunkers. Starting April, batteries will need to be scrapped together with their respective electric vehicles, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said on Friday. Offenders will face fines of up to 50,000 yuan ($7,174), detention or revoked business licenses. The world's largest EV market is bracing for 1 million tons of dead car batteries to come up for recycling by 2030 as the first wave of Chinese EVs start heading for the junkyard.

For CATL (A), key risks include: 1) overcapacity of battery manufacturing in China 2) geopolitical factors which restrict CATL market share and 3) increased competition from vertically integrated OEM's. For CATL (H), key downside risks include: 1) overcapacity of battery manufacturing in China 2) geopolitical factors which restrict CATL market share and 3) increased competition from vertically integrated OEM's. Key upside risks include: 1) improvements in unit profit and 2) better-than-expected EV battery demand.

Downside risks include: 1) increasing competition within the EV battery industry, 2) rising raw material costs which could put additional pressure on the EV value chain, 3) battery quality issues which could lead to battery recalls, and 4) a larger than expected conglomerate discount. In addition, oversupply of chemicals and weak demand could create sustained lower margins. Key upside risks include: 1) divestment of the LGES stake; 2) faster growth in demand for EV batteries and related materials; and 3) margin expansion driven by improved cost management and effective raw material cost pass-through.

Key upside risks include 1) increasing market share with customer diversification which could increase sales, 2) rising margins with better costs control and raw material pass through and 3) improved battery quality which could lower the risks of recalls. Key downside risks include 1) lower tax benefits from US IRA policy which LGES currently benefits from, 2) redistribution of tax credits with customers or partners, and 3) cost inflation in battery manufacturing.

Samsung SDI's earnings growth depends on the adoption of electric vehicles and energy storage systems to boost battery revenues and profits. Any change in strategy by automakers, or lack of cost declines would reduce this upside. Other downside risks include loss of sales to OEM switching battery suppliers. A reduction of US IRA subsidies would reduce benefits to Samsung SDI's profitability which is also a downside risk. Key upside risks comprise: 1) higher-than-anticipated demand for ESS batteries, particularly driven by robust data center requirements; 2) increased EV battery demand from clients such as BMW following the launch of new models; and 3) accelerated commercialization advancements in solid-state battery technology

Key upside risks include 1) faster than expected growth in cathode demand, 2) better than expected operating margins as a result of improving costs or higher utilization, and 3) government policies and subsidies that favor Korean battery supply chain companies.
