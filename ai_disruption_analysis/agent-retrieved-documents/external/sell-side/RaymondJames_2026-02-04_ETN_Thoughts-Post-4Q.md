We maintain our Outperform rating on ETN as we believe sustained, above-average growth and margin upside justify a premium valuation.

Ramp-up costs associated with the company's +$1.5BB of capital projects are likely to continue to weigh on Electrical Americas in the near-term. Some of these projects have been accelerated on account of the company's strong 2H25 order rates, leading it to 'front-load' more fixed costs. In addition, ETN will experience some elevated below-the-line costs (interest expense being one) which are also weighing-on EPS growth near-term. That said, we expect the market will begin to discount an increasingly-compelling 2H earnings set-up that we think will have its largest segment (Electrical Americas) exiting the year with ~32% EBITA margins, alongside continued steady improvement in Aerospace.

We are encouraged by the sharp sequential uptick in 4Q TTM Electrical Americas orders, and see scope for continued positive momentum fueled in large part by the robust data center category (which ETN believes the current backlog equates to ~11 years of growth runway at the current build rate). Its comps will begin to benefit this quarter as the one large 2024 hyperscaler order falls out of the TTM equation. We believe TTM orders in this segment could inflect further into the +30% neighborhood in 1Q and likely 2Q. We see 2026 as another year of backlog build for ETN's Electrical segment, with similar underlying trends evident in soon-to-be acquired Boyd. We update our 2026 cash EPS estimate to $13.40, down slightly from before on account of some below the line tweaks. We see a bullish set-up in '27 as the pending Vehicle spin is completed, and the +$13BB of announced M&A deals are integrated.

We arrive at our $415 price target by assigning a ~30x multiple on our 2026 cash EPS estimate. This equates to 24x our 2026 EBITDA estimate. Given the long growth runway in both the Electrical and Aerospace segments, and 'scarcity value' as a direct data center investment beneficiary, we feel this premium multiple is justified.

Perhaps no company in our coverage has upgraded its profile and grown earnings power as much as ETN over the past decade or so. Through active portfolio management, the company has shifted to primarily Electrical and Aerospace. Combined, we expect to generate ~90% of segment profits in 2026. We expect these businesses to maintain their above-average growth rates through 2026, at least. The electrification / data center theme has attracted a new set of growth investors, as some traditional value-oriented ETN holders have likely moved on. This could present an interesting dynamic if/when Electrical order growth eventually slows.

While it was founded over 100 years ago as a vehicle component supplier, the last decade has brought significant change to Eaton. Today, ETN is a global power management company with 94% of 2025 profits from its Electrical and Aerospace segments. ETN's portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from a number of secular tends like electrification, energy transition, and digitalization.

Margins surprise to the upside, and the 'beat-and-raise' record continues. Electrical segment benefits as longer-cycle Systems get delivered at better margins. Aero margins improve on more favorable mix (aftermarket), and as supply chain pressures abate. Data center sentiment tailwinds continue to support the multiple and the stock trades at $450.

Following are some general risk factors that pertain to the businesses of the subject companies and the projected target prices and recommendations included on Raymond James research: (1) Industry fundamentals with respect to customer demand or product/service pricing could change and adversely impact expected revenues and earnings; (2) issues relating to major competitors or market shares or new product expectations could change investor attitude toward the sector or this stock; (3) Unforeseen developments with respect to the management, financial condition or accounting policies or practices could alter the prospective valuation.

ETN equity provides thematic investors with lots to like, and given scarcity value in large cap U.S. 'electrification' plays, it has attracted fast money, which could lead to volatility in the stock price. High backlogs will eventually create a headwind as growth and tough comps create a lid for the multiple. Other risks that could negatively impact ETN include potential shortages of raw materials, as well as changes in the competitive dynamics of Eaton's markets or the end markets that it serves.

RJL has developed a proprietary algorithm for risk rating individual securities. The algorithm utilizes data from multiple vendors, and all data is refreshed at least monthly.

In the event that a suitability rating changes after the published date, the new rating will not be reflected until the analyst publishes a subsequent report.
