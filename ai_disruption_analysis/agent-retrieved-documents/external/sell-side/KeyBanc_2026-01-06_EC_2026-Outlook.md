There were two completely different endings to the E&C story in 2025. It was another happy ending for Specialty E&Cs (except FLR), while the Core E&D names bore the brunt of policy whiplash and the emerging threat of AI. While all E&C stocks took a hit early in 2025 on DeepSeek worries, the sell-off was short lived, at least for the marquee AI infrastructure and power infrastructure names.

The winners keep winning: FIX, DY, and PRIM , the three top performers in 2025, were also top four for the last three years combined, through a combination of estimate upgrades and multiple expansion. Since we launched in early 2024, the NTM EV/EBITDA multiple for FIX has expanded 5.3x, and DY 's by 3.6x. EME 's 313% return since YE22 was impressive, but it lagged this year on margin and growth concerns. MTZ continues to outperform since the 2022 execution challenges, and its 5.4x multiple expansion (NTM EV/EBITDA) in two years helped somewhat narrow the (still wide) gap with PWR. MYRG 's 47% appreciation masks the impressive rally mid-year from the lows when the problem project challenges bottomed. PWR continues to be a steady outperformer with multiple expansion supporting its earnings outlook. Among the specialty E&Cs, PWR's multiple expanded the most in two years, by 6.2x. CTRI staged an impressive rally in

4Q25, making up a bulk of the 2025 gains. FLR had a tough year as macro challenges and SMR sale took away focus from the core story.

A year to forget for core E&D names: ARCAD underperformed on earnings misses, and slower revenue growth enough to prompt leadership changes. PSN was weighed down first by the cancelation of the confidential contract and then by news of being edged out on the FAA BNATCS contract. Similarly, KBR 's stock never recovered from the cancelation of HomeSafe, and a soft STS investment environment, with the announcement of a spin not helping. ACM performed well until the 4Q analyst day when it gave back more than the gains for the year on commentary around the threats of AI. J started the year slow as the restructuring took hold, picked up momentum in 3Q, only to give it all back on the AI concerns that ACM brought to the surface. TTEK was the first to be impacted by Trump's policy storm but weathered it well despite losing 10% of sales overnight. The stock recovered off 1Q lows on consistent results from the core business and a systematic guidance reset to account for the loss of USAID revenues.

The year that was and how we think 2026 will play out: 2025 was a mixed year for E&Cs. Unlike in 2023 and 2024 when all but one E&C had positive returns, 2025 showed what happens when investors have high expectations (i.e., elevated multiples). All specialty E&Cs (but FLR) outperformed the SPX and all core E&D/federal contracting names underperformed. Heading into 2026, we see a narrower path to beating the market after years of multiple expansion in anticipation of accelerating/improving earnings. 2025 saw a taste of the market's high expectations from the performance of the E&D names and aggressive price action for some specialty contractor names where results did not meet the high expectations (detailed in the following slides). Key investment themes for 2026: As such, we identify three key investment themes to guide our top picks for the year.

· AI as a threat, disruptor and opportunity: (slides 11 to 12) Thus far the market has focused only on AI risks with no regard for potential benefits. While early to call outperformers and underperformers, we think the indiscriminate multiple de-rating seems excessive. · Labor as a scarce resource: Skilled craft labor has emerged as the key scarce resource with the prevalent view that economic rent will accrue to those that have access to the resource. The results are mixed, as we show on slide 13. · M&A as a driver of growth: Thus far, investors have rewarded M&A with companies seeing immediate multiple arbitrage on announced deals (FIX, DY, PWR). This will likely continue as long as the targets immediately contribute to revenue and margins, as has been the case for the MEP deals (slide 14). Key end Markets to watch in 2026: The key end markets in 2026 are going to be the same that have driven specialty E&Cs over the last several years.

· T&D, renewables, and natural gas generation remain highlights as the electrification trend and datacenter market grows (slides 18 to 19). · Telecom will be a key growth market to support BEAD, FTTH, and datacenter led fiber builds (slides 24 to 25). · Natural gas pipeline expansions will continue as midstream operators serve LNG expansions, de-bottleneck networks, and expand to serve the growth in gas generation (slide 26). · Non-res construction will remain a key growth market to support datacenter infrastructure and the overall reshoring theme (including pharma and chip fabs) (slide 27). Names we highlight for 2026: Based on our outlook and the key themes outlined, we are highlighting four stocks for 2026.

· DY (OW; $426 PT): DY returns as a top pick on top-line growth, margin expansion, and accretive M&A outlook. · MTZ (OW; $264 PT): MTZ is also a returning favorite on improving execution and multiple avenues supporting growth. M&A likely as well. · PRIM (OW; $158 PT): PRIM is a new addition this year as we anticipate several favorable end markets to support earnings with M&A also likely to drive growth · TTEK (OW; $43 PT): TTEK remains a favorite of ours despite the USAID led setback last year. We see it as the best positioned E&D name.

Keeping our ratings intact, adjusting estimates and price targets: We are not making any ratings changes with this outlook and are adjusting estimates to reflect post 3Q model fine-tuning. We are lowering our price targets for ACM, ARCAD, J, and PSN on lower multiples (more on the following slides). We are raising our price targets for DY and MTZ on higher multiples reflecting a stronger growth outlook and are trimming our PRIM price target. Our TTEK target is maintained.

Core E&D and federal contractors: The reasons for the underperformance of the E&D names and Federal contractors were different for each, and some were outside management control (e.g., cancelation of HomeSafe, USAID, PSN's confidential contract), but how management teams managed the fall out mattered. For the year, the average E&D NTM EV/EBITDA multiple declined ~2.5x, almost uniformly across the board. The federal contractors (KBR, PSN, TTEK) took the hit earlier in the year and the AI narrative led ACM and J to see a decline in 4Q. We think, so far, TTEK has done the best job with realigning its resources post USAID and providing clarity on the path forward. The jury is still out on the 'AI winners', but in the short term we think the market panic around AI becoming an existential threat appears exaggerated given the limited evidence. As such, we are keeping our OW ratings on ACM and J but lowering our price targets (and multiples) to reflect the increased risk around

AI until we see how the companies respond. ARCAD remains in the penalty box for underperforming on its growth targets, but given the sharply discounted multiple and the changes in the management team (new CEO+CFO), we remain hopeful of a turnaround in 2026. As for the federal contractors, we think KBR remains in a holding pattern until more clarity emerges around the spin and managements for STS and MTS present their respective strategic outlooks. PSN has taken a credibility hit from the FAA contract disappointment (following the abrupt cancelation of the confidential contract), but we think at current valuation, it appears reasonable to keep our OW given its exposure to the strategic programs for the U.S. government and improving CI profitability.

We highlight TTEK in the Core E&D space: We think TTEK managed the elimination of USAID as best as it could, realigned resources to other geographies and growth markets, and is better off in the new paradigm with significant margin expansion. TTEK has a track record of accretive M&A and boasts a strong balance sheet. On the AI risk, we think TTEK is the most immune of its peers, is further ahead with its contracting mix, and its niche focus on complex water and environmental projects creates a subject matter expertise moat. The multiple has de-rated post USAID and TTEK has provided comprehensive FY26 guidance. We maintain our $43 PT.

Specialty E&Cs: All specialty E&Cs (but FLR) outperformed the XLI and SPX in 2025 and the average NTM EV/EBITDA multiple expanded ~1.5x - mostly uniformly (MTZ and FIX outperformed; EME, MYRG underperformed). So far specialty E&Cs are all getting the benefit of the doubt that as long as the end markets (led by datacenters, electrification) continue to grow, the stocks should continue to work. FIX and MTZ delivered on the promise of improving earnings and saw above average multiple expansion. On the other hand, to underscore how punitive the market can be, EME underperformed in 4Q on less than perfect execution on a handful of projects, causing margins to decline by a modest 20-30 bps and the stock to decline 6% in 4Q (-20% since 3Q earnings, vs. SPX +1%). Similarly, PRIM shares fell ~20% immediately post 3Q results, (only to recover later) on a more muted renewables

revenue outlook despite a significant pull forward in 3Q. We think this points to the high expectations for execution and growth. Accretive returns on labor productivity and M&A will drive stock performance, in our view. We highlight DY, MTZ, and PRIM . DY has successfully silenced its many critics: With the acquisition of Power Solutions and a focus on improving labor productivity and margins, DY has positioned itself as a premier E&C with an extended runway of growth ahead via BEAD, FTTH, and long-haul fiber builds. MTZ continues to inch forward on margins: 2025 was more of an EPS growth year, but we expect margins to improve in 2026 as Comms and Pipeline revenue growth dominates (both are MTZ's highest margin segments). We think M&A is likely, either for increased T&D capabilities or to enhance civil construction capabilities.

PRIM has an undemanding valuation with several growth avenues: We think PRIM will benefit from gas generation, renewables growth, and large diameter pipeline expansions in 2026. A new CEO could be instrumental in M&A to enhance T&D and electrical capabilities, further extending the growth runway.

Other thoughts: FIX has outperformed its peers on virtually all metrics we have tabulated and is likely to continue doing so, justifying the multiple expansion it has witnessed. PWR , on the other hand, has seen the most multiple expansion over the last two years, but its organic growth and margin progression has lagged many of its peers, leaving us unconvinced about its ~ 7x EV/EBITDA premium to the SPX, at least while the market continues to reward growth and risk. Lastly, on FLR , we applaud management's decision to completely exit its SMR stake, and while we had highlighted it as a top pick last year, we ended up downgrading it mid-year on the valuation mismatch around SMR. We will watch for backlog progression before getting more constructive.

AECOM (ACM) - OW $115 PT: We are keeping our OW on ACM but lowering our PT on a lower multiple. We think ACM created an unnecessary negative narrative around its AI adoption strategy, which will be hard to disprove in the near term. We would have preferred its continuing use of AI as a tool to improve profitability while gradually changing pricing structures to favorably split the benefits. That said, we don't think there is a fundamental change in strategy at the company, and the near-term risk-reward seems favorable as the sale of the CM business and use of proceeds to buyback shares support EPS and as margins continue to expand. The shares are likely to be in the penalty box, but at current valuations we think they are worth owning as sentiment improves (end markets remain robust for now with AMP-8 in the U.K/, Australia growth reviving, and tailwinds from IIJA benefiting U.S. infrastructure development).

Arcadis (ARCAD) - OW €42 PT: ARCAD has been a difficult stock to own in 2025 as the company continued to scale down growth expectations even as margins held. We think it made the right decision to conduct a buyback program vs. M&A given the depressed valuation, and we are staying OW. The valuation gap vs. the U.S. peers remains wide and with a new management team in place (CEO and CFO), we are hopeful of a new, more aggressive growth strategy. We also expect management to work on cost reductions to improve profitability. 2026 is the year for the company to roll out its new three-year outlook, but with a new management team, we feel like we may start the year with a smaller investor event where we will likely hear about the use of AI, growth outlook, and cost management, to be followed by a CMD in the fall when the new management team has had a chance to collectively flesh out a long-term strategy. We are lowering our PT as we bring our E&D multiples down across the board.

Jacobs Solutions (J) - OW $154 PT: With the spin and related cost outs behind it, J has a chance in 2026 to show that it can deliver on margin expansion while maintaining its long-term target of 6-8% top-line growth. As anticipated, J made an announcement on PA Consulting, which should help with revenue and cost synergies for the combined business. We feel that J has been effective in communicating its view on the use of AI and its benefits/risks to the business. We think it will be crucial to continue to communicate the roll out of AI tools and how that is impacting contracting. We are maintaining our OW because we think J is well positioned to benefit from larger datacenter builds that require complex design advice and related power consulting. We also expect J to be a beneficiary of the life-sciences/pharma reshoring anticipated in coming years and think the complexity of these projects make them less vulnerable to be done via AI. We are lowering our PT as we bring our E&D multiples down.

KBR (KBR) - SW: Despite the de-rated multiple for KBR, we are staying SW for now. We think there is limited conviction in the LT guidance, especially since the suspension of Lake Charles. We think a guidance reset for both segments is necessary before investors step in. We agree that the valuation is compelling (and will likely remain so even after the guidance is reset) but the business environment for MTS (uncertain award timing, slow procurement) and STS (delayed energy transition, inflation taking a toll on large projects) will keep investors on the sidelines until management lays out its long-term strategy for the two businesses as it hits the road to pitch the separation of the businesses. We anticipate a new MTS management team to be announced soon, KBR to host analyst days in May/June, and the spin to follow. A sale of MTS is possible, but unclear if it will be sold as a unit.

Parsons (PSN) - OW $76 PT: The termination of the confidential contract and the disappointment of being edged out of the FAA BNATCS award made for a disappointing year for PSN. We think the market was over exuberant on the value for PSN for the FAA contract, leading to an over-reaction on the downside. We see it as a positive since PSN can now participate in the project on more equitable terms. While the growth rate in 2026 will suffer because of the two contracts, we think it gives PSN a chance to prove its capabilities in the FS segment via its alignment of resources to the administration's national defense priorities (cyber, space, and missile defense) as it pursues roles for homeland security and Golden Dome. We think margin expansion should continue as CI hits its stride with consistent DD margins. We are lowering our PT on a lower multiple as we see a challenged federal contracting environment continuing.

Tetra Tech (TTEK) - OW $43 PT: We had expected DOGE to be more noise than substance, but we did not expect the overnight elimination of USAID, which made up ~10% of TTEK's revenue. Still, TTEK maintained its 6-10% (core, organic) growth algorithm +margin expansion (a lot more margin as USAID dilution ends). A diversified exposure to federal government helps, as does the strong growth for State and Local. With RPS, 40% of revenue is international, and AMP-8 awards will start to contribute in 2026. While the Trump administration policies around renewables and budget cuts for Fed Civ agencies has been a negative, we think TTEK is the most de-risked E&D name heading into 2026 as U.S. Commercial comps get easier in 2H26, as do those for the International segment, especially Australia. Canada is emerging as a growth area with infrastructure spending ramping.

Centuri Holdings (CTRI) - SW: CTRI has positioned itself favorably to benefit from the LT growth trend in T&D capex budgets and has taken on an aggressive stance toward bid work, extending its pipeline of opportunities to include $1.7B in near-term strategic bid opportunities with awards expected by the end of 1Q26. The company, under CEO Brown, has also pushed harder on securing new MSAs to support the backlog and is guiding to 10% revenue growth in 2026. The removal of the SWX overhang has improved liquidity and has brought in new investors into the name. We also think management was right in issuing shares in 4Q, which will help to bring down leverage faster than it would through operations. We think these efforts help to bring CTRI closer to par with some of its SMid competitors and the valuation is still undemanding relative to peers. That said, we remain SW while we watch the execution on the recent backlog.

Comfort Systems USA (FIX) - SW: FIX, through a combined M&A and organic growth strategy, has emerged as a leading non-res construction company. Through modular expansion and recurring M&A, it has stayed ahead of the growing datacenter and reshoring theme, as has been evident in the 20%+ annual organic growth rate, and the near doubling of EBITDA margins since 2022. Tight specialty labor supply and the drive to building larger, more complex facilities faster has played to FIX's strengths. The company has taken advantage of the business's favorable cash characteristics and low capital intensity to boost growth via M&A, a pattern we expect will continue since the industry remains fragmented and end market demand drivers remain strong. The market has, however, rewarded FIX for these attributes, and the NTM EBITDA multiple has gone from 12.3x two years ago, to 15.6x a year ago, to 20.2x currently. We think the multiple expansion is partially linked to the datacenter related feeding frenzy, and to the extent that there

is a cooling off in the datacenter sentiment, we expect a better entry point.

Dycom Industries (DY) - OW, $426 PT: We maintain DY as one of our top picks and raise our PT on the improved growth and margin outlook. We reiterated that DY is still in the early stages of a telecom investment expansion cycle - led by FTTH growth, a revived and streamlined BEAD program, and the upcoming growth from datacenter led fiber investments. The recent acquisition of Power Solutions puts to bed several concerns around DY's LT outlook, including its FCF/NI conversion, capital intensity, and the over-reliance on the FTTH theme. We expect more M&A from DY to further increase its presence in the mechanical/electrical space, which should serve further to diversify it away from the FTTH theme. A combination of the entry into the electrical space and the upcoming long haul fiber build opportunities for datacenters extend the growth runway for DY and create a case for DY to trade at a multiple more in line with peers. At 10.5-11.0x our FY28E

(~CY27E), we think there is opportunity for multiple expansion, which, along with positive estimate revisions, should allow the shares to continue outperforming.

EMCOR Group (EME) - SW: EME remains well aligned to the higher-growth non-res end markets with exposure to data centers, semiconductors, pharma, life sciences, and healthcare. The datacenter construction momentum and manufacturing reshoring is providing EME with extended visibility and an opportunity to continue improving margins. While the shares have been range-bound in 2H25 and the multiple gap with FIX has widened, we remain SW due to the potential for slowing revenue growth and decelerating EBITDA margin incrementals. We think EME has been slower than peers on the M&A front, potentially ceding ground to competition within its core union territories. The margin softness caused by less-than-ideal execution on two projects and the related stock price reaction post 3Q is a sign of how the space is priced for perfection and raises the bar for EME and its peers so far as execution is concerned.

Fluor Corporation (FLR) - SW: We see 2026 as a recharge year for FLR. With LNG Canada handed over, and the sale of NuScale shares in the final stages of execution, the focus can rightfully return to core FLR. We we expect a cleaner financial profile as the problem project bleed continues to slow, the Santos payment is put behind, and FLR executes on stocks buybacks with SMR proceeds. That said, we don't think our 2026 estimates are fully de-risked since how 2H26 progresses will depend on the timing and size of large bookings, including SRPPF, LNGC2, and potential bookings in the nuclear enrichment field and the power-gen sector. FLR may have to relax its strict discipline of focusing on reimbursable cost structures to participate in the gas and nuclear generation build cycle in the U.S. Globally, while the momentum in mining appears to be strengthening, the energy transition theme may take a longer pause and the uncertain macro may push large project decisions out further. All things

considered, we find a SW rating as most appropriate.

MasTec, Inc. (MTZ) - OW, $264 PT: We wrote last year that MTZ was on the cusp of revenue acceleration, and it turns out that is where the biggest upside in 2025 was. As the pipeline infrastructure momentum built, so did MTZ's revenue guidance through the year. While the company will also end the year with somewhat higher margins than we foresaw at this time last year, we expect meaningful margin expansion in 2026 as Communications and Pipeline revenue growth take center stage (both of which are MTZ's highest margin segments). We are continuing with MTZ as a top pick for 2026 as the combination of FTTH and BEAD boosts comms revenue and the pipeline revenue momentum builds with a peak, not likely until 2027-2028. The company is on track to book a second large transmission project even as Greenlink slows in response to permitting obstacles. We expect M&A to be a feature for 2026, and it could either be in the T&D space as MTZ takes on bigger projects

or in the CE&I segment to boost the company's capabilities for civil construction and site prep. We think the shares are likely to outperform this year due to a combination of estimate upside and modest multiple expansion. We raise our PT to reflect a higher multiple to reflect the growth outlook.

MYR Group (MYRG) - SW: MYRG shares have made a dramatic come back from the solar execution related challenges from 2024. To the company's credit, it ringfenced the problem projects effectively and provided a clear update to the Street as it brought those projects to a close. The shares responded accordingly, justifying our upgrade at $111.66. While we subsequently downgraded MYRG in the fall when the shares were $208.03 on valuation concerns. The shares have continued to perform well as management provided an upbeat outlook for 2026, leading estimates to go higher. While we believe that MYRG is well positioned for T&D project wins and the fundamental outlook for the C&I business appears strong given the reshoring trends (notably MYRG raised its margin targets on the recent 3Q call), we prefer to remain SW as we await more color on timing of potential large transmission bookings. We would also expect MYRG to embark on M&A in 2026 given its net cash balance sheet.

Primoris Services (PRIM) - OW $158 PT: Despite two plus years of strong outperformance, we maintain PRIM as a favorite for 2026. The valuation is undemanding relative to peers and there are several growth drivers heading into 2026. While the shares took a breather post 3Q results based on commentary related to renewables, we think the safe harbor deadlines and OBBBA led clarity on renewable tax credits will continue to drive growth in solar and storage. In addition, PRIM stands well positioned to benefit from the growth in natural gas generation, large diameter pipe opportunities, and the buildout of long-haul and middle mile fiber. We think the company is on the lookout to further improve its T&D capabilities via an acquisition and could also enter the electrical contracting space like many of its competitors. A newly appointed CEO will present to the Street on the 4Q call and we expect the guidance for 2026 to be conservatively placed, it being the first from the new CEO.

Quanta Services (PWR) - SW: We maintain our SW rating for PWR. We think PWR is the leader in the electrification theme, as evidenced by the recent agreement with NI and Zachry. As large load tariffs get sorted out and as BTM opportunities grow, we expect PWR to be an outsized participant. The company has focused on diversifying away from the regulated T&D customer base towards more C&I customers through the acquisitions of Cupertino and Dynamic. In theory, these actions should allow for improved organic growth and higher margins. But the large size of PWR's base can mask the marginal improvement in profitability. So far, PWR's organic growth rate has lagged its closest peers, but that can change in 2026 as Cupertino flows through the organic line. The company will host an investor event in the spring where we hope to get more granular color on management's organic growth strategy, areas of focus for M&A, and ways to improve margins. For now, we cannot get behind the valuation premium to the S&P.

AI and its drivers have become probably the largest investment opportunity that the E&C space has seen in a very long time. The theme has impacted all companies we cover as our coverage witnesses both its buildout and its applications. While the early beneficiaries have been those involved in building the datacenters and related infrastructure, the gradual maturation of the technology is now impacting how our Engineering and Design companies conduct business. In the life cycle of a construction project , we believe pre-engineering, consulting, and project advisory work is likely to be more insulated from the general onslaught of AI technologies, at least for a while, since projects get bigger, custom-made and complex, and need subject matter expertise. The next phase, detailed engineering and design, we believe, is most likely to see disruption in coming years as AI models become more sophisticated. The last step, which is the actual construction of facilities for obvious reasons, will be the least impacted given the need for physical labor. E&D names in our coverage most impacted by the potential of AI use include ACM, ARCAD, J,

and TTEK . The companies have worked on adapting the businesses more toward the front-end advisory and design phases of a project to create a moat. TTEK, we believe, is furthest ahead in thinking through the impacts of AI.

- ACM: ACM brought the 'AI as a threat/opportunity' issue to the forefront on its recent analyst day when it outlined AI as a strategy to be ahead of the curve. The company has bought a Norwegian AI-driven autonomous engineering company Consigli for ~$390M that can help speed up design work, allowing for higher margins on fixed-price projects. Based on the recent AD deck, ACM categorizes front end consulting into advisory and PM, and engineering into technical design. On a total $7.5B NSR base, ~$200M is advisory, PM is $1.3B, and engineering design and technical consulting is ~$6B. So, ~20% of its business is currently more immune to AI threats than the remaining 80%, in our view. That said, management also included a slide pointing to the advisory and PM part growing to ~50% of NSR over time, making those the primary growth drivers going forward. For FY25, 25% of ACM's revenue was from fixed price

contracts, 38% from cost reimbursable, and 37% from GMP. ARCAD: While ARCAD does not provide the same granularity, based on our conversations it is using AI when evaluating project pursuits and to improve internal efficiencies. The technology is helping the company expedite and inform go or no-go decisions by using AI as a benchmarking tool for pricing and resource allocation. We think ARCAD believes that automating and standardization can save a lot of hours when evaluating projects in the pipeline. We think the company is also investing in tools to create further efficiencies.

- J: J does not provide a formal breakdown between front-end consulting or advisory vs. engineering. J is leveraging AI by developing proprietary digital tools to create solutions across segments and applications. An example is J's partnership with Palantir to aggregate data and use AI to optimize project schedules. J believes subject matter expertise will create a competitive advantage as AI becomes more mainstream. As J continues to integrate AI, particularly into the planning phase of projects, it anticipates shifting to more fixed-price or outcome-based pricing with success-driven targets, and away from the traditional billable hours model - although the timing for this type of change is still a ways away. J expects the private sector to be more embracing of AI tools in the near term, with the public sector likely to take longer to pilot the tools and adapt to its implementation. For FY25, 32% of J revenue was from fixed-price projects and 68% from cost-reimbursable.

TTEK: TTEK, we believe, is the furthest ahead in anticipating AI threats to its business model. Per its 2024 AD, TTEK gets 65% of NSR from front-end consulting with a goal to get to 70-75% over time. The balance 35% is from engineering and PM. Fixed-price work made up 43.5% of revenue in FY25 (42.6% T&M and 13.9% cost plus) and TTEK's CEO said at the end of the year fixed-price work made up essentially 50% of revenue. Another advantage that TTEK has is that it has not invested in any overseas design/Excellence Centers where a bulk of the detailed engineering and design work is performed.

Our thoughts: We think the E&D business model is bound to be disrupted by the proliferation of AI, it's only a matter of time. Contract structures will evolve: The challenges will be a reduction in billables hours and companies with the biggest share of fixed-price contracts will emerge the strongest ( TTEK ). But even in this case, we think the contract structure will change toward success driven targets where the benefits will have to be shared with the customer. We think global Excellence Centers as maintained by ACM, ARCAD, and J are at risk of being rendered stranded if AI takes over a bulk of the detailed engineering and design work.

Overseas Excellence Centers could be rendered stranded over time: The overseas Excellence Centers have been a strong driver of margins for ACM, ARCAD, and J in recent years as the companies have shifted more billable hours overseas to lower cost centers. If detailed engineering and design does fall prey to AI, it seems natural to us that the companies will need fewer overseas workers. ACM CEO on the recent AD mentioned that with the use of AI, labor will no longer be a governor of growth. J references its global delivery model, where it is gaining margin arbitrage and higher efficiencies by shifting work overseas. ARCAD continues to expand its GECs with the fourth GEC launched in 2025 (and second in Romania). TTEK has not invested in these Excellence Centers, preferring to cede the work to competitors while focusing on its core water/environmental expertise.

End market exposure will matter: While all the E&D names have spent the last several years (since divesting their construction businesses) to upgrade their project portfolios and shift toward higher end advisory and design work, we think end markets will also matter with J's focus on higher value life sciences, chip fabs, and data centers likely keeping it more closely aligned with its customers, even as we expect the private sector to be more amenable to adopting AI technologies than federal, state, and local customers. Complex environmental projects and water management projects will continue to need subject matter expertise, in our mind, favoring all our E&D names.

M&A may have to take a bigger role: For several years, E&D companies (particularly ACM and J) have favored organic growth and portfolio rationalization to grow and become more profitable than M&A. Several industry tailwinds, including fiscal stimulus such as the IIJA and similar projects in the U.K., E.U. and Australia/NZ, have allowed that strategy to succeed and for the companies to generate MSD-HSD organic revenue growth. As we lap these fiscal stimuli and as AI disrupts the traditional business model, it may become harder to grow at rates much higher than the GDP growth rates of the underlying economies. We think to maintain a competitive edge and maintain high growth rates M&A, as a way to consolidate the industry and to increase exposure to select growth industries, may become a necessary part of the core strategy. To date, we think WSP (NC) has been most aggressive in consolidating resources and technologies through M&A, especially in the U.S. (Power Engineers and TRC being the

most recent large acquisitions). See our M&A chart on slide 14. Source: KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. estimates, company reports J FY25 Revenue Mix by Contract Type TTEK FY25 Revenue Mix by Contract Type

So far, a tight labor market has not impacted growth for specialty E&Cs: Labor has not yet presented itself as a deterrent to growth. The specialty contractors are trying to stay ahead of the growth curve by hiring and training craft labor with the argument that economic rent should accrue to those with access to the scarce resource. PWR is probably the one with the most advanced training facilities, including its Lineman College and Advanced Training Center to train personnel for growth in the T&D and renewables space. The company is setting up a separate program for training electricians, a skill that is likely most in demand under the datacenter, reshoring theme. DY is revamping its training program to meet the upcoming growth and is setting up a new training center in Atlanta, GA. MTZ is positioning for growth in pipeline infrastructure and communications and its headcount at 3Q25 stood at 38K, ~+19% vs. in 2024. Headcount growth has been most pronounced for FIX over the past decade (as has been its revenue per employee), which speaks to its ability to recruit, train,

and retain its workforce. As project backlogs grow across end markets (Pipelines, T&D, C&I manufacturing, Communications), the labor market for specialty construction labor is likely to stay tight. This will require a consistent process of reducing turnover and training new hires to maintain productivity and for specialty E&Cs to benefit from the labor tightness. In the chart below, we show that while some companies have been able to improve labor productivity net of overall wage growth, others have lagged. We think the chart shows what we have seen in the margin progression for several of our companies. Those with exposure to electrical and mechanical work have shown the most outperformance in revenue per employee vs. overall wage growth vs. those leveraged to the more traditional T&D or O&G industries. We think to be awarded a premium for access to labor, the scarce resource, E&Cs must also earn a higher-than-average return on that scarce resource (unemployment rate for the construction industry is hovering near a 10-year low of ~4%).

M&A as a driver of growth - there is room on E&C balance sheets: As we show below, the cadence of M&A has moved toward smaller-but more specializedtransactions . As a result, E&Cs have become more specialized in their selected end markets and have been able to garner better contract terms and margins. We expect that the trend of acquiring niche businesses, primarily to target high growth end markets (e.g., PWR/Cupertino, DY/Power Solutions) will continue, especially given the strength of balance sheets within our space as shown in slide 15. While buybacks remains an option for use of balance sheet strength, with multiples hovering near their highs and end market demand showing unprecedented strength, we think industry consolidation makes a lot more sense in the current environment. FIX is the poster child for this approach showing the accretive value of consolidating the fragmented MEP industry through a strategy of recurring M&A and building a bigger organic base. While PWR has done the same, the results have not been

as stellar. We think companies that have hesitated on M&A (EME, MYRG, PRIM) in recent years or have not been as active may need to accelerate M&A to benefit from end market growth - especially if that becomes one of the few ways to access skilled craft labor.

Below, we provide a detailed breakout of our coverage's end market exposure. For 2026, we expect non-res (driven by data centers), telecom, and power infrastructure (including natural gas) to be the fastest growing end markets - potentially all DD+. Transportation will likely continue to enjoy tailwinds from IIJA funding, but defense services growth is likely to be lumpy given the dysfunction in federal government contracting processes. We expect DD electric T&D capex growth in 2026, and likely an improved spending environment as generation growth picks up. The rate of growth in renewables (solar and wind) could slow after several years of strong demand after playing catch-up from 2022. We expect an improved gas pipelines project environment. In the following slides, we discuss our outlook for the key end markets in detail.

Our tracker shows 13% utility capex growth outlook for 2026: As expected, utilities are starting to put capex aside for generation as load growth forecasts continue to grow. While our database shows 13% top-line capex growth in 2026, ex. generation the capex growth will be 12% (see slide 20) and that is probably a more relevant number for our specialty E&Cs.

4Q25 implied capex spend looks aggressive: We are, however, apprehensive about our tracker showing a nearly 40% sequential increase in T&D capex spending in 4Q25 (47% of full year). In 2024, while the forecasts were for 11% utility capex growth (and a ~30% weight on 4Q), the result was 8% utility capex growth for the year as 4Q came in below expectations. We think a similar outcome is possible this year. While we believe E&Cs (PWR, PRIM, MTZ, MYRG, CTRI) have provided prudent guidance for 4Q and do not necessarily see downside risk, we also don't want to get too excited by the top-line utility spending projected outlook for 4Q and expect it to come below expectations. We don't think unspent capex automatically rolls over to the next year but depends on the specific projects and the regulatory construct surrounding the approval of such capex.

Customer bill affordability will be a top issue to watch in 2026, with 36 states holding gubernatorial elections: We expect the utility response to this crisis to manifest in O&M reductions but do not expect capex plans to be revisited. Utilities will point to PJM auction clearing prices and highlight the need for more infrastructure spending, not less, to respond to the newish paradigm of load growth. If there is a push to build more generation to meet the growing demand, then utilities will push for more T&D investments to bring that load to customers. Several utility executives have spoken about the affordability crisis, but no one that we know has spoken about capex cuts to tackle the issue. They will, in fact, argue that growing demand will help to spread the cost over more customers and therefore capex investments will not contribute to bill inflation. Politicians, on the other hand, will likely put out plans including what the NJ Governor-elect did to freeze rates, forcing utilities to work with state governments to cut some costs to meet the promise. We don't expect

O&M reductions to have a meaningful negative impact on our specialty E&Cs, presuming that a bulk of that work is performed in-house.

Large transmission had a decent year in 2025 and it seems like project momentum is picking up: 2025 saw PWR announce a project in CA, and its participation in the long-delayed Boardman to Hemingway transmission line. MTZ on its part started construction on Greenlink West and is set to book another large transmission project in 4Q. We also witnessed Grain Belt Express become political football when the DOE withdrew its $4.9B loan guarantee for the project. The Trump administration has de-emphasized the Biden initiative to jumpstart large transmission by earmarking National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETC), but there has been positive momentum on the part of the ISOs - MISO, ERCOT and PJM in particular to expand their 765-kV infrastructure to support generation growth and build resiliency. We expect the 765-kV lines to start coming into backlog in the later part of this decade. The SPEED Act passed by the House but stalled in the Senate could in theory help with federal NEPA permitting timelines, but ultimately, large transmission projects

rely as much on state and local permitting as they do on top-down federal reforms. We published our T&D deep dive recently, which includes more details on our views and the theme: E&C: 2025 Transmission & Distribution Deep Dive.

Utility Scale Solar gets clarity from OBBBA: WoodMac is forecasting 197 GWdc of new utility-scale solar between 2025-2030 (~33 GW annually), which is +2GW vs. its prior forecast, but we think the forecast may prove low as it has in the past. Despite the well-documented challenges with supply chain, EPC constraints, and interconnection queues, utility solar installations will likely be close to 40 GW in 2025, at par with 2024 despite the uncertainty in 1H caused by policy uncertainty. In hindsight, 2023 was considered to be a year hard to beat when utility scale solar installations reached a record 30GW+, but despite the challenges associated with tariffs, domestic tax credit uncertainty, and the DOI's slow walking of projects on federal land, solar projects have continued to benefit from an economic perspective, as well as from a time to power perspective. Google's recent purchase of Intersect Power shows the commitment of large power consumers, including hyperscalers' focus

on zero carbon power. More importantly, we think the Treasury guidelines to define safe harboring came in more lenient than expected and we expect most Tier 1 developers to be able to safe harbor enough projects to build through the period of ITC/PTC validity, which goes through the end of the decade for projects that are safe harbored by July 4, 2026. BESS is the real growth story: Grid Scale battery storage grew 45% to 11.5 GW in 2024 and through 3Q, the industry has already added 13.2 GW with another 5.8 GW under construction. Falling costs of battery storage and the elongated tax credit period for installing utility scale storage has created a favorable environment for energy storage, including its load following characteristics that make them ideal for use by data centers. While we expect all our specialty E&Cs to participate in the BESS buildout, it's worth noting that the revenue opportunity from building battery storage is a small fraction of that for utility scale solar.

Tarriff worries remain in 2026 and we are waiting for the FEOC rules: There are lurking worries, including the invalidation of Biden's solar tariff moratorium that could impose significant retroactive duties on importers on solar cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam that were imported in the moratorium period between June 2022 and June 2024. Last August, the U.S. Court of International Trade overturned the DOC rule allowing duty free entry of solar cells and modules during the Biden moratorium but the case is currently on appeal to the Federal Circuit court, and an adverse ruling could put the importers on the hook for $53B in retroactive duties. Also on watch are the final FEOC rules. Proposed Treasury rules regarding the FEOC restrictions as updated by OBBBA are expected to be released around 1Q26-2Q26, but the rules take effect on January 1, 2026, creating a period of uncertainty between the rules taking effect and the final guidelines being issued. We think developers and manufacturers

have likely initiated ownership reviews and supply chain mapping to stay ahead of the pending guidelines. A final FEOC rule is not expected until the end of 2026.

The rush for additional generation is favoring co-located gas (nuclear not so much): The rush for additional power via datacenter demand and relaxed emission rules has led to a surge in gas generation requests and announcements of delayed legacy generation retirements. Several IPPs are re-starting mothballed nuclear generation (Three Mile Island, Palisades, Duane Arnold, Susquehanna) to bring power to the grid faster than new nuclear can. Despite announcements from the federal government to partner with Brookfield to bring new nuclear generation, we remain skeptical on the timing of those projects if they get off the ground (see our report on the topic here). FLR is the only E&C in our coverage likely to take on an integrated power project - CCGT or Nuclear, and we would expect the company to become more flexible with its contracting discipline to secure some power infrastructure related backlog.

~9 GW of new gas-fired capacity is expected to come online in 2026: Following 6.3 GW that is expected to come online in 2025, the industry is expected to add nearly 9 GW of new gas fired generation capacity in 2026, which will more than offset the planned retirements for the year. MISO is expected to add 2.45 GW, followed by 1.6 GW in ERCOT. PWR is partnered with Zachry on EPC delivery for a CCGT for an AMZN project in Indiana with NiSource. PRIM expects continued growth in gas-fired generation and is targeting balance-of-plant and specialty services for upcoming projects, while wrapping up work on 350 MW of simple cycle projects in Abilene, TX (and potential for a Phase 2 on the same site). We expect gas generation work to be a growth driver for PRIM in 2026.

Capital Markets Under construction

We are tallying a total of 18 GW of gas fired generation facilities that have been announced, 12 GW under construction, and 73 GW under development. By state, TX leads the way in terms of planned total capacity of 2.9 GW. OK is next with 1.1 GW planned. Among the largest ones under construction is the ETR Orange County Advanced Power Station in TX, which has a 1.3 GW nameplate capacity. The second largest Is the 940 MW Trumbull Energy Center in OH, which is expected to be online in 1Q26 to serve the PJM market.

FTTH: We expect annual FTTH passings to accelerate to 13.3M passings by 2028E (vs. 11.8M in 2025E) with T increasing its annual run-rate to 4M passings by 2027 (vs.~3M) to achieve +60M locations by 2030 (vs. 35M-40M), VZ targeting +30M passings by 2028 (vs. 27M-28M), and TMUS is targeting 12M-15M passings by 2030 (vs. 4M-5M). BEAD: We believe U.S. states will begin deploying BEAD funding in 2Q/2H26 and ramp deployment spending into 2028-2030 with ~$18B in total funding addressable to E&Cs (more here and here), with DY and MTZ likely the primary beneficiaries, but given the scale of the ramp, PWR and PRIM will also likely participate.

Middle-Mile/Long-Haul: We view this as a 2027+ opportunity as hyper scalers begin to ramp spending on ultra-low latency fiber to interconnect DCs. Several have signed partnerships/agreements to invest in this initiative, including LUMN and QTS and AWS and VZ, with partnerships announced in November (detailed here). We expect PRIM to join MTZ and DY in the middle mile buildout, which DY has quantified as a $20B five-year TAM (this includes inside the fence opportunities, but we think middle mile/long haul is the bulk of the work).

Rising natural gas demand has created a strong demand environment for natural gas pipeline infrastructure: We track data from several midstream companies pointing to proposed pipeline projects. While some are expected to break ground in the NT, the tail of opportunities appears long as several are still awaiting FID. We believe that the NT project opportunity is concentrated toward de-bottlenecking and LNG-driven demand, but in the longer term we expect additional pipeline infrastructure demand to stem from rising natural gas generation to serve the anticipated rise in power demand (e.g., Desert Southwest Extension). MTZ is most leveraged here, followed by PRIM and PWR.

Construction and jobs data look okay, but how much can be attributed to data center spend? We track data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Census Bureau, and Dodge Construction to get a read on the state of the nonres space. Construction spending has been impacted by headwinds such as trade policy, higher interest rates, and tight lending standards. · FRED data shows the divergence in growth rates for Total Construction Employment vs. Non-Res Specialty Trade Contractor Employment since the start of 2023 (both on a seasonally adjusted basis) and highlights the tightness in the demand for specialty contract labor in recent months · Construction PIP data shows decelerating non-residential construction spending, with data centers being the only strong subsegment (albeit with a small base). · Dodge Construction data, which tracks major U.S. energy infrastructure projects that have recently started construction, show an increasing share of data center work.

Investment conclusion: We rate ACM OW, though lower our PT to $115 (from $144) reflecting 11x on FY27E adj. EBITDA (vs. 14x previously). We appreciate ACM's backlog momentum and portfolio of opportunities that position it for 5-8% organic NSR growth in the NT. The shift from E&D to advisory and PM to insulate it from AI-related disruptions is noteworthy, but timing is uncertain (more here). We expect margin improvements to continue as it targets +20% adj EBITDA margins exiting FY28, benefiting from AI-driven leverage, share gains, and continued efficiencies. NT investments ( ~ 65 bps margin headwind) and potential risks to the E&D portfolio from AI may continue to weigh on investor sentiment and the multiple.

F1Q26 earnings outlook: Our F1Q26 and FY26 estimates are in line with consensus and the midpoint of guidance and reflect: 1) sale of CM business ($520M-$540M NSR; $85M EBITDA); and 2) ~ 360 bps NSR growth headwind vs. FY25 due to a reduction in working days. We expect any potential adj. EPS guidance raises through FY26 to be primarily driven by margins or share repurchases relative to stronger NSR growth, with ACM focused on AI-enabled efficiencies and operational improvements, the CM business contributing a 16.0% adj. EBITDA margin (vs. 16.8% total in FY25), and sale of CM considered EPS neutral when including the redeployment of cash for buybacks.

2026 outlook: ACM heads into FY26 with 4% backlog growth, potential continuation of funding for IIJA projects (~36% spent in ACM's primary markets thus far), steady S&L budgets, and improving International demand trends (2H25 International backlog +8% vs. 1H25 +1%). This set up likely allows ACM to achieve organic 6-8% NSR growth in FY26. Americas growth will be unfavorably impacted by CM sale, although we will move that to discontinued ops. International revenue will likely start off softer and pick up in F2H26 as comps ease and as NT budget constraints in the transportation end market in the U.K. ease and AMP-8 revenue begins to flow later in FY26. ACM expects to double its higher-margin advisory business from ~$200M in FY25 to ~$400M as it exits FY28 with the goal of achieving ~$1B in NSR over the LT. ACM anticipates its PM and

advisory businesses will represent half of total NSR over time, which should support an extended runway for margin expansion above its +20% target by FY29E.

Investment conclusion: We rate ARCAD OW, though lower our PT to €42 (from €53) to reflect 6.5x 2027E EBITDA, vs. 8.5x previously. We continue to like ARCAD's diversified exposure to macro-resistant global end markets and strong backlog growth (+11.8% organic growth in 1H25), but the top-line growth has disappointed. We appreciate the focus on margin expansion and expect ARCAD to exit 2025 at an EBITA margin of 11.6%, (+20 bps in 2H25 vs. flat margins y/y in 1H25). Disappointing results have led ARCAD's discount vs. U.S. peers to widen (7x discount to ACM/J/TTEK). The ongoing buyback program should support shares in the near term and we are hopeful of a strategy reset with a new CEO and CFO in place.

C4Q25 earnings outlook: Consistent with management's outlook calling for improved organic revenue growth in 2H25 (vs. -0.1% in 1H25), we are lowering our top-line estimates to now reflect organic growth of +1.8% in 2H25, vs. our prior estimate of +3.5% for 2H25. ARCAD is managing profitability through the expansion of key client programs, workforce adjustments, and efficiencies tied to a new GEC. While investments throughout 1H25 mitigated potential margin expansion in the NT, we expect ARCAD to exit F4Q with a ~12.7% EBITA margin (+20 bps y/y).

2026 outlook: We expect Mobility revenue growth to accelerate in 4Q25 and achieve the lower-end of ARACAD's 2024-26E MSD-HSD% organic revenue growth outlook in 2026 as ARCAD ramps up on larger project bookings in the U.S. and Canada and benefits from recent awards in the UK. We expect a continuation of strong demand for water and energy solutions in the datacenter end market, which should drive organic growth in Resilience. We expect ARCAD to reset its growth targets when it reports 2025 results (vs. the target of 2024-2026E target of MSD-HSD% total organic growth). We think the 12.5% EBITA margin by 2026E is achievable. We are forecasting ~4% organic revenue growth in 2026E, translating to a ~3% CAGR over 2024-2026E, and a 12.3% EBITA margin (+70 bps y/y). There could be upside on margins following investments in digital platforms and improved GEC capacity. We expect a guidance review with 2H

results, which should include a path to growth and cost reductions, to be followed by a detailed strategy session later in the year once the new management team is fully integrated.

Investment conclusion: J remains well aligned to critical water, environmental, transportation, and life sciences/advanced manufacturing end markets with a resilient E&D and consulting business model. We maintain our OW, though lower our PT to $154 (from $170) based on 12.5x FY27E EBITDA, vs. 13.75x previously, as J continues to benefit from a strong pipeline of opportunities across numerous end markets. We expect J to mainly benefit from its data center, semiconductor, life sciences, and global water pipeline, which were up 5x, 20%, 50%, and 50%, respectively, at FY25-end, potentially setting it up for an extended period of ~ HSD% organic revenue growth. We also see a runway of margin expansion from global delivery efficiencies, commercial model enhancements, and a mix shift toward frontend consulting and advisory work.

F1Q26 earnings outlook: We maintain our estimates, which align with the midpoint of FY26 guidance (6-10% organic revenue growth, 50-80 bps of adj. EBITDA margin expansion, $6.90-$7.30 in adj. EPS, and 7-8% FCF margins) and reflect a sequential decline in revenue, EBITDA margin, and earnings in F1Q25 followed by improvements through FY26. Consistent with commentary, we model a larger contribution of GM improvement in FY26 (+230 bps y/y and consistent with consensus) relative to SG&A leverage. Our estimates do not reflect the impact from the recent announcement to buy the remainder of PA Consulting (more here), and we do not expect a change in fullyear guidance until the transaction closes at the end of F2Q.

2026 outlook: J's FY26 guidance calls for 6-10% NSR growth and 50-80 bps of margin expansion, benefiting from a F4Q25 BTB of 1.1x, backlog growth of +6% y/y, and continued margin tailwinds. While F4Q25 backlog growth and the 6-10% organic revenue growth outlook for FY26 do not provide a 1:1 correlation, we see the FY26 outlook as achievable due to the potential for J to convert its pipeline within faster growing end markets throughout the year. We also see J benefiting from one extra week of activity in F4Q26, which we could contribute ~ 150 bps of additional y/y growth. As a result, we model sequential improvement in net revenue growth from +6.5% in F1Q26 to +9.6% in F4Q26, with growth led by life sciences/advanced manufacturing and critical infrastructure (particularly in the Middle East). We will adjust our estimates for the PA transaction when it closes but expect it to be modestly accretive for

Investment conclusion: We previously lowered 4Q25E and 2025E revenue estimates to reflect a slower pace of new awards in MTS with the shutdown representing a headwind to new award activity and protest resolutions. We view the more conservative 2025E top-line outlook as achievable and believe the decision to spin-off MTS business (see here and here) may position KBR as a multiple re-rating story once more details are available. Despite the anticipated spin, we think investors need a refreshed outlook on LT targets for the MTS and STS segments and clarity on a more comprehensive outlook for the STS business before becoming more constructive.

C4Q25 earnings outlook: We maintain our 4Q25E and 2025E estimates, but lower 2026E. We anticipate a strong STS BTB in 4Q25, which includes multiple engineering design and technology licensing contracts in the Middle East and Europe. Our 4Q25E revenue of -12% is based on -13% for MTS (-12% ex HomeSafe) driven by delayed award conversions and -10% for STS (+3% vs. 3Q25 and consistent with the outlook to improve STS revenue sequentially). Our 4Q25E adj. EBITDA margin of 13.2% (+250 bps y/y) reflects 10.5% MTS margin (+120 bps y/y), benefiting from the removal of HomeSafe and 23.7% for STS based on mid-teens underlying margins (ex EE).

2026 outlook: Our below-consensus EPS is based on 2026E revenue growth of +6%, which is based on ~5% MTS growth (vs. 5-8 % MTS F27E revenue target) and ~10% STS growth (vs. 11-15% STS F27E revenue CAGR). Our 2026E EBITDA margin of 11.8% is based on 10.4% MTS margin (+30 bps y/y), benefiting from the removal of HomeSafe, and 20% STS margin (-340 bps y/y), on low-teens core EBITDA margins ex EE and lower EE vs. 2025. We expect KBR to benefit from the $10B in IDIQ-MAC task orders for NAVSUP and D&I/S&S, which reflects a recent $117M follow-on contract for NAVAIR and $99M task order for USSF. But we remain cautious on the ability to achieve the FY27E MTS financial target of 5-8% growth (2023-2027E) given the uncertain federal contracting environment. STS growth hinges on engineering design

and technology licensing contracts in the ME and Europe, but we remain cautious on KBR's ability to achieve FY27E STS financial targets of 11-15% growth. The phase down of Plaquemines and the recent suspension of Lake Charles LNG create an air pocket, which we expect management to address when it is on the road pitching the spin to investors.

Investment conclusion: We rate PSN OW, though lower our PT to $76 (from $81) to reflect a more normalized 13x on our FY27E EBITDA (vs. our prior 15x). Despite the unfavorable FAA contract update, delays in government award activity, and reductions to procurement officers, we think PSN remains well positioned to achieve the LT MSD% or better organic revenue growth outlook given its exposure to larger IIJA projects (Hudson Tunnel, I70 Design-Build, etc.), momentum in the Middle East, and alignment to national defense priorities with PSN awarded a seat on a $10B IDIQ contract for the U.S. Navy and a $15B Pacific Deterrence Initiative following 3Q25.

C4Q25 earnings outlook: We maintain our 4Q25E and 2025E estimates, in line with the midpoint of guidance, benefiting from an $8.8B backlog (72% funded). We did not build in any contributions from the FAA's BNATCS contract in our model. Our 4Q25E revenue decline of 3% is based on a FS revenue decline of 16% or +15% ex CC (consistent with PSN's forecast for ~15% core FS revenue growth in 4Q25) and a CI increase of 15%. Our 4Q25E adj. EBITDA margin of 9.4% (+90 bps) is based on a 9.0% for FS (-100 bps), which reflects continued investments in bid and proposal activity and lower volume on the fixed-price CC (LDD% margins), more than offset by CI margins of 9.8% (+340 bps), reflecting strong program execution.

2026 outlook: PSN will likely guide to slower organic growth in 2026E (MSD% vs. +9% in 2025) ex CC due to delays in gov.t award activity. As such, we are lowering our 2026E to reflect core growth of ~5% (ex CC) vs. 7% prior, which includes ~7% CI growth and ~3% FS growth. This translates to ~0.5% reported growth after adjusting for ~$355M in CC revenue in 2025 and ~$10M in 2026E (in 1Q26E). We lower our adj. EBITDA margin expansion estimate to ~20 bps, vs. the +20-30 bps target, reflecting the loss of the CC (LDD% margins). We see upside potential in CI given momentum in the ME, ramping IIJA-related projects, and activity in water & environmental end markets. We believe there is room for guidance upside as PSN builds momentum within CI and the federal procurement process normalizes. PSN's $8.8B backlog with

~$11B in contract wins that have yet to be booked into backlog and $58B pipeline that includes more than 15 opportunities worth >$500M offer support for growth.

Investment conclusion: We rate TTEK OW and maintain our $43 PT based on 16.5x FY27E EBITDA. We believe TTEK is poised to benefit from numerous investment opportunities in water and environmental design/engineering and consulting, boosted by a ramp in S&L funding for municipal water supplies and digital automation tools, demand for water and wastewater solutions tied to technology clients, and AMP-8 bookings in the U.K. We see TTEK benefiting from Canda's ~ $200B infrastructure plan, opportunities in Australia (Brisbane Olympics), and spending on coastal resiliency in the U.S., U.K., and Australia. TTEK is positioned for the 6-10% NSR growth ex USAID and multi-year margin expansion as it benefits from the macro resistant megatrends of water and environmental resilience spending.

F1Q26 earnings outlook: Despite the loss of USAID and a six-week government shutdown in F1Q26, we expect a beat and potential guidance raise. TTEK should provide F2Q26 and updated FY26 guidance, which could come in at or better than consensus and initial guidance. We maintain that the FY26 outlook is a conservative starting point, given no USAID or disaster response activity is included in guidance, and no margin accretion from potential resource allocation for disaster relief is included in the 15% EBITDA outlook (+70 bps y/y), growth comparisons get easier in 2H26, and TTEK could still benefit from the FAA BNATCS contract (under Peraton). It holds contracts and MSAs worth >$30B to perform high-end water services for mining, power generation, defense, and DC clients, which could provide guidance upside.

2026 outlook: Our FY26E are in line with guidance and consensus. We think the cautious start sets up for a beat and raise cadence through the year (as is customary). Compared to last fiscal year, TTEK's business is much more diversified with a larger commercial, international, and S&L business and a more diversified customer mix (DCs, S&L, mining, minerals, and power customers). Despite the loss of USAID and the six-week shutdown in F1Q26, we think TTEK's 2030 financial targets remain in play and see opportunity for continued organic revenue growth and margin expansion, benefiting from a shift to fixed-price contracts (~50% in F4Q25 with the goal of reaching 60%), a shift to front-end consulting (65% in 2025 with the goal of reaching 75%), and improved labor utilization.

Investment conclusion: CTRI's niche role as a core services provider for electric and gas utilities continues to position it well to benefit from the multi-decade T&D buildout and O&M opportunities tied to an aging grid. CTRI's increased emphasis on bid work has led to significant backlog growth in 2025. While valuation remains reasonable, we stay SW until margin execution improves and leverage trends align with peers.

4Q25 earnings outlook: We expect CTRI to reiterate its focus on core growth and capital efficiency in the 4Q print. Storm restoration revenue is expected to be de minimis, consistent with management's stance, leaving core performance as the key driver. We model revenue at the midpoint of 2025E guidance and EBITDA near the midpoint, which reflects y/y margin pressure from mix and lack of storms. Gross margin should exceed 3Q levels, with incremental improvement in electric segments as crew counts and work hours expand. Gas margins are expected to trend upward, while union electric benefits from bid activity. CTRI reported 1.0x BTB in 3Q, supported by ~$815M in new awards, and continues to target >1.1x for the year, aided by a nearterm pipeline that has grown to $3B from $2.2B last quarter, with bid work now representing over half of opportunities, a positive shift that helps derisk management's expectation of DD core growth in 2026. CTRI is tracking $1.7B in strategic bids and $1.3B in MSA

renewals expected to be awarded before year-end, including ~$1.3B tied to DC-area transmission opportunities. Leverage ended 3Q at 3.8x and CTRI expects a strong cash quarter in 4Q, which, along with the recent equity issuance, should allow for leverage to improve, supported by disciplined capex ($75M-$90M).

2026 outlook: We expect CTRI to deliver DD core growth in 2026, underpinned by a strengthening bid pipeline (> $13B) and rising win rates (targeting 35-40% vs. ~27% YTD). Management commentary suggests gross margins of 7-7.5% for gas, 9-9.5% for union electric, and ~10% for non-union electric, leading us to model EBITDA margin at ~9.1%, down from prior 10.3%. Storm revenue is excluded from our forecast as CTRI no longer guides for restoration work. Capital efficiency initiatives (fleet optimization, leasing vs. buying, improved DSO) should support FCF and deleveraging. OSW will cease to be a factor in 2026 and a diversified pipeline across electric and gas, combined with disciplined execution, provides visibility into sustained growth.

Investment conclusion: FIX remains favorably aligned to high-growth non-residential construction markets, including data centers, semiconductors, pharma, and healthcare. DC construction momentum and broad-based manufacturing reshoring have been strong over the past couple of years and our conversations with management suggest DC momentum remains robust. FIX's $9.4B backlog (+65% y/y) offers strong visibility over a longer period than has normally been the case with opportunities, including life sciences and chip fabrication (2026-2028). Enhanced coordination between FIX subsidiaries, investments in technology, improved economies of scale, and greater scope and density of DC work continues to provide FIX with the potential for continued margin improvement. Though, at ~19.5x our 2027E EBITDA, we remain SW.

C4Q25 earnings outlook: We maintain our above-consensus 4Q25E and 2025E estimates, with our 4Q25E revenue growth of +32% y/y (consensus: +25%) driven by organic growth of +27%, above guidance for high-teens organic growth. Importantly, our organic growth estimate suggests revenue remains flat sequentially, consistent with the prior three-year period (2022-2024). We model 4Q25E adj. EBITDA margin of 15.6% (+160 bps y/y) with our EBIT margin of 14.3% (+220 bps y/y) driven by continued GM expansion and SG&A leverage. We model 4Q25E BTB of 1.0x but see potential for upside given recent strength in backlog trends and the historical uptick in 4Q BTB relative to 2Q-3Q (2Q25/3Q25 BTB of 1.5-1.6x).

2026 outlook: 2026 should be another strong year of revenue and earnings growth for FIX, with management guiding organic revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens range and EBITDA margins expected to remain at least remain at current elevated levels. We maintain our above-consensus 2026E organic growth estimate of +17% (consensus: +15.5%). We expect traditional conservatism from management with an upward bias to 2026 guidance as the year progresses (consistent with 2025), especially as FIX brings additional modular square footage into operation. We expect FIX to be active in M&C given its favorable net leverage position. FIX has ~$860M in cash and a net leverage ratio of -0.6x. We expect M&A to be rewarded positively.

Investment conclusion: We maintain DY as OW and raise our PT to $426 (from $392), which reflects 12.5x on FY28E EBITDA. We continue to believe that DY is poised to benefit from numerous growth opportunities in the near- and medium-term including FTTH builds, BEAD buildout beginning in F2Q27+, and middle-mile/long-haul fiber buildout for datacenter connectivity. We expect revenue growth to accelerate in FY27 (vs. FY26) partly on M&A and for there to be a long tail of fiber activity at least through the end of the decade.

F4Q26 earnings outlook: We are raising our F4Q26 and FY26 estimates to add the contribution from the recently closed Power Solutions acquisition. Our F4Q26 revenue growth of +26% y/y (from +20%) is based on 11% organic growth, $65M in revenue from Power (completed on Dec 23), and $95M contribution from the extra week in F4Q26. We maintain our F4Q26 adj. EBITDA margin estimate of 11.3% (+60 bps y/y). Our revenue estimate (ex. $65M PS contribution) and margin estimate is in line with the midpoint of guidance and consensus. Our FY25 and FY26/FY27E EPS estimates reflect historical and estimated adjustments for intangible asset amortization expense, following DY's decision to adjust this item on a pro forma basis. We expect the focus of earnings to be on F1Q27 and FY27 guidance, details on the FY27 outlook including FTTH and cadence of BEAD,

and LT expectations associated with the ~$20B middlemile/long-haul DC interconnect opportunity.

FY27 outlook: We see DY as a strong beneficiary from multiple growth opportunities mentioned above. Over the last 6-9 months, T (T, GigaPower, & Lumen) raised its fiber passings outlook to +60M passings (vs. +50M) by 2030, TMUS (T-Mobile, Lumos, & MetroNet) cited a 12M-15M passings target by 2030 implying an additional ~8M homes passed, and VZ (VZ & FYBR) laid out plans to achieve ~30M passing by 2028 (vs. ~26M in FY24), with DY benefiting. BEAD should contribute starting in mid FY27 and ramp through F2H27+ as shovels hit the ground following final state approvals. DY is also expected to benefit from middle-mile/long-haul DC interconnect initiatives with a LUMN and QTS partnership and a VZ/AWS partnership to start. Our model reflects +34% revenue growth in FY27 based on 7.5% organic growth, ~$1.1B

in incremental PS revenue, and ~$360M in BEAD-related revenue, and an adj. EBITDA margin of 14.5% (+110 bps y/y).

Investment conclusion: EME remains well aligned to the higher-growth non-res end markets with exposure to data centers, semiconductors, pharma, life sciences, and healthcare. DC construction momentum (85% of network and communications RPOs), manufacturing reshoring, further geographic expansion (following Miller and Danforth acquisitions), and divestiture of Emcor UK with MSD% margins (detailed here) gives EME visibility to multi-year top-line growth and an opportunity to improve margins over time. Though, with margin headwinds tied to acquisitions expected to persist in the NT (detailed here) and EME trading at 14.2x our 2027E EBITDA, we remain SW.

C4Q25 earnings outlook: We are refining our 4Q25E and 2025E estimates to reflect higher 4Q25E revenue based on the closing of the John W. Danforth Co. acquisition (on November 4) partially offset by the closing of the Emcor UK (on December 1) sale but trimming out-year estimates on impact of M&A and other fine tuning. Our model reflects ~7% organic revenue growth in 4Q25E for both the electrical and mechanical segments and 39% and 10% reported revenue growth, respectively, with electrical benefiting from Miller and mechanical benefiting from Danforth. Our 9.6% consolidated op. margin (-70 bps) is based on 12.8% electrical margins (-300 bps) pressured by project inefficiencies tied to EMS's geographic expansion, and intangible amortization expense from Miller, and 12.8% mechanical margins (-50 bps), partially offset by a 30 bps increase tied to USA building/industrial services and reduced contribution from MSD% margins tied to Emcor UK.

2026 outlook: Despite 3Q25 electrical segment margin headwinds, EME remains on track to exceed its initial 2025 EPS guidance by $2.25, or 10%, with strength in consolidated revenue and margins being the driver as EME benefits from recent acquisitions, the divestiture of its margin dilutive Emcor UK business, and favorable mix (including data center, high-tech manufacturing) within the mechanical segment. We expect another year of strong growth for EME with organic RPOs +20% y/y as of 3Q25 and in line or better margins within those RPOs. We expect the strongest growth in DC revenues this year, with Network and Communications (85% DC) RPOs up 99% in 3Q25. EME has $650M+ of cash and no debt, which could spur M&A or repurchases through 2026. Our ~in-line EPS for 2026 assumes MSD-HSD revenue growth and just under 10% EBITDA margin.

Investment conclusion: While we applaud management's stance in exiting its SMR stake, we believe there is limited confidence in FLR's LT target for 10-15% EBITDA growth through 2028 (now expected to be a 2029 event). Margins will likely remain under pressure until the handover of the problem projects like Gordie Howe, 635/LBJ and LAX, expected to be complete until 1Q/2Q. FLR may have to relax its strict discipline of focusing on reimbursable cost structures to participate in the gas and nuclear generation build cycle in the U.S., which we think will be viewed positively. Globally, while momentum in mining appears to be strengthening, the energy transition theme may take a longer pause and the uncertain macro may push large project decisions out further. All things considered, we find a SW most appropriate.

C4Q25 earnings outlook: We maintain our 4Q25 estimates, which are in line with the midpoint of 2025 guidance (flat revenue growth, $525M adj. EBITDA, and $2.18 in adj. EPS). We are forecasting ~$2.2B in awards in 4Q (also in line with the revised guidance of $13B in 2025), mostly concentrated in the U.S. segment where FLR continues to see incremental opportunities, leading to a consolidated BTB of 0.5x. We would look for commentary on FLR's plans to appeal the fine the Company paid in December to Santos (more here). We also expect updates to the progress made on the share buyback target of $800M through February 2026.

2026 outlook: Management indicated that deferred awards and cancellations have put pressure on EBITDA growth rates leading to a 4-quarter shift in profit delivery. FLR now expects to achieve its 2028 EBITDA target (announced in April 2025) in 2029. Most of the new awards in ES will be 2H weighted with macro uncertainties, oversupply in chemicals and defunding of energy transition weighing. Additional legacy funding anticipated in 2026 will affect CF generation. We see 2026 as a recharge year for FLR. With LNGC handed over, and the sale of SMR shares in the final stages of execution, the focus can rightfully return to core FLR. We expect a cleaner financial profile as the problem project bleed continues to slow; the Santos payment is put behind and FLR executes on stocks buybacks with SMR proceeds. That said, we don't think our 2026 estimates are fully de-risked since how 2H26 progresses will depend on the timing and size of large bookings including

SRPPF, LNGC2 and potential bookings in the nuclear enrichment field and the power-gen sector.

Investment conclusion: We reiterate our OW and raise our PT to $264, predicated on 15x our 2027E EBITDA. We are encouraged by MTZ's consistent execution and margin improvement, supported by strong demand across Communications, Pipeline Infrastructure, and Power Delivery. Operating leverage, disciplined project selection, and strategic M&A optionality position MTZ for sustained margin expansion and a potential multiple re-rating as confidence in its multi-year growth outlook builds.

4Q25 earnings outlook: We expect MTZ to deliver a solid 4Q, supported by strong execution in Communications and Pipeline Infrastructure, offsetting seasonal softness in Power Delivery and CE&I. We match 4Q guidance. MTZ posted 1.1x BTB in 3Q and expects to book the second large transmission award in 4Q, with revenue contribution starting mid-2026. Pipeline bookings remain robust, with $700M added in 3Q and visibility improving despite the book-and-burn nature of the segment. Management is likely to reiterate confidence in multi-year growth drivers and provide incremental detail on Greenlink permitting progress and the new transmission project. Cash generation should accelerate in 4Q, supporting strategic flexibility heading into 2026.

2026 outlook: Management has an informal 2026 framework calling for ~10% revenue growth, ~20% EBITDA growth, and ~25% EPS growth, driven by broad-based strength across segments. Pipeline Infrastructure is a key driver with DD% growth expected in 2026 and a sharper step-up in 2027. Communications should see strong growth from FTTH, BEAD, and fiber expansion, with margin improvement as mix and execution improve. CE&I benefits from robust renewables visibility, aided by tax credits and rising battery attach rates, while Power Delivery remains solid with Greenlink and a second large transmission project adding upside. MTZ reiterated confidence in sustaining HSD-LDD% organic growth through 2027-2028, citing strong end-market fundamentals and operating leverage opportunities that could drive consolidated EBITDA margins toward DD over time. With a net leverage target of 1.5-2.0x signaling dry powder, MTZ is well positioned to pursue tuck-in M&A focused on enhancing execution

capabilities and expanding its self-perform platform. A T&D acquisition could also be possible to further boost its power delivery capabilities. We view 2026 as a year of margin expansion and accelerating growth, setting the stage for a multi-year re-rating.

Investment conclusion: The Company has emerged from a year of execution challenges into a year of +HSD core growth in both segments with margins within the LT guided ranges and room to run beyond that. We maintain that MYRG has come a long way from the project execution and has successfully realigned the business back to its core growth and margin objectives. At current valuation, we believe the shares are fairly valued and we maintain SW.

4Q25 earnings outlook: MYRG does not provide formal guidance, but we expect management to reiterate segment margin targets and provide color on backlog trends. Our estimates assume +HSD growth in core T&D and C&I, with reported T&D revenue flat to slightly down as challenged clean energy projects roll off. C&I growth should remain strong, supported by multi-year transportation and airport projects announced earlier in the year, as well as continued momentum in data centers and advanced manufacturing. Margins are expected to trend toward the middle of the target ranges (7-10.5% for T&D and 5-7.5% for C&I), aided by improved execution and completion of problem projects. MYRG ended 3Q with $2.67B of backlog and 1.0x BTB in both segments, and management highlighted steady bidding activity in T&D and multiple awards in C&I across core markets.

2026 outlook: Management's updated commentary points to 10% revenue growth in 2026 across both segments, supported by a constructive bidding environment and strong C&I market momentum. MYRG raised its C&I margin expectations to 5-7.5% (from 4-6%) while maintaining the T&D margin range of 7-10.5%, reflecting confidence in execution and mix improvement. Backlog visibility remains solid, with MSAs contributing ~60% of T&D revenue and a growing pipeline of large transmission projects for 2027+, including 500 kV and 765 kV opportunities. C&I continues to benefit from secular demand drivers in data centers, healthcare, clean energy, and transportation, with recent awards reinforcing market strength. MYRG's disciplined project selection and efficiency gains should support margin expansion beyond the midpoint of target ranges over time. With net leverage near zero, strong FCF, and an available credit facility, MYRG is well positioned to pursue M&A in ancillary services or resume share repurchases. We see 2026 as a year of normalized growth

and margin recovery, with execution on these targets critical given the recent multiple expansion. Sources: KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., FactSet Note: Specialty contractor comps: DY, MTZ, PRIM, PWR.

Investment conclusion: We maintain our OW rating on PRIM and continue to see meaningful upside as the Company leverages its leadership in utility-scale renewables and storage, expands its power delivery footprint, and benefits from secular growth in communications, and natural gas generation. Our PT of $158 is based on 13.5x 2027E EBITDA. We believe the pieces for strong growth in 2026 are firmly in place, supported by renewables, natural gas generation, and pipeline opportunities. As core growth verticals take a larger share of revenue and margin expansion follows, we see PRIM well positioned for outsized value creation.

4Q25 earnings outlook: We expect PRIM to deliver results at or above the recently raised 2025 guidance midpoint. Management has guided to GM of 10-12% for both segments, and we expect incremental improvements in 2026 as pipeline projects normalize, and renewables execution stabilizes. Bookings will be the key focus as energy BTB was soft in 3Q on timing delays, but management indicated several bookings closed in 4Q and expects a 1.2x or higher BTB for Energy, supported by renewables and gas generation wins (including Fermi). PRIM sees Energy backlog trending toward $3.6B vs. ~$3B currently.

2026 outlook: The 2026 outlook for renewables is more conservative (flat to up vs. prior modest growth expectations) due to potential pushouts tied to design modifications and timing. PRIM is confident in 2026 bookings momentum including those in natural gas generation and pipeline work which remain key growth drivers, with >$3B in pipeline opportunities over the next 12 months and incremental bookings expected in early 2026. Communications continues to provide steady growth and represents upside as fiber and DC-related work expands. New CEO Koti Vadlamudi will join the 4Q call and is expected to set the tone for 2026, including potential LT targets and a refreshed growth outlook at a CMD in 2026. With net leverage near zero and strong cash generation, PRIM has flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions in T&D and electrical C&I, targeting HSD growth and IRRs north of 12%. We see 2026 as a pivotal year for PRIM, with margin expansion and backlog recovery positioning the Company for sustained

double-digit growth.

Investment conclusion: PWR continues to solidify its status as a high-quality specialty contractor as defined by scale and execution. However, at 20.2x 2027E EBITDA vs. the S&P at ~14.7x, we maintain our view that further multiple re-rating is likely capped in the near term, and we do not see NT estimate upside, ex M&A.

4Q25 earnings outlook: We expect PWR to deliver results broadly in line with guidance, with revenue strength in EIS offsetting margin pressure from UUIS. Key 4Q assumptions include a sequential ramp in EIS revenue driven by solar, storage, and data center projects, continued solid execution in renewables, and a seasonal stepdown in storm restoration activity following a strong 2024 comp. Underground utility work should rebound modestly as large pipeline comps ease and gas utility projects pushed from earlier in the year begin burning. PWR posted a strong 1.4x BTB in 3Q, led by EIS bookings, and management indicated momentum in solar-plus-storage and DC work should continue into year-end. We expect tone on the bid environment to remain constructive, with management reiterating confidence in long-tailed growth opportunities across T&D, renewables, and low-voltage electrical and mechanical scopes. FCF should strengthen in 4Q, aided by working capital normalization.

2026 outlook: We expect PWR to outline a multi-year roadmap at its March Investor Day, with 2026 positioned as a year of continued growth across core segments. While renewables revenue growth will likely moderate after several years of outsized expansion, margin progression remains a key watch point as execution improves and integrated scopes scale. T&D and substation work should sustain MSD-HSD growth, supported by grid hardening, EV penetration, and AI/data center infrastructure buildout, while underground utility rebounds after lapping tough pipeline comps. Large transmission projects and modular construction opportunities represent incremental upside, though timing remains difficult to forecast. Strategic M&A is expected to remain active, focused on targets that align with PWR's self-perform model and expand capabilities in substations, modular, and right-of-way services. With a strong balance sheet and proven ability to deploy capital, PWR is well positioned to deliver DD EPS growth in 2026, supported by scale leverage, backlog

visibility, and continued leadership in integrated energy and infrastructure solutions.
