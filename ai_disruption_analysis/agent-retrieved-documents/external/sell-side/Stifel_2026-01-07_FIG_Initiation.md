We are initiating coverage of Figma with a Hold rating and $40 TP. Our TP is based on an 11.8x EV/Revenue multiple on our 2027 estimate. In our view, Figma is poised to build on its category leadership in design through recent product additions and the proliferation of AI functionality. We see an appealing opportunity for share gains through a combination of net new customer acquisition and expansion through new products and the pricing and packaging actions the company undertook last Spring. As we move into 2026, we expect the role of AI in the creative and design spaces and Figma's ability to capitalize on and monetize its own solutions like Make will remain a key component of the debate around the durability of high growth trends. Despite our positive view on the company's competitive positioning and addressable opportunity, we await a more favorable risk/reward setup at current valuation levels.

Extending category leadership through meaningful platform expansion. Figma has a proven track record of expanding the reach of its platform into newer areas of the design lifecycle, successfully generating clear NDR expansion cycles tied to major rollouts. To date, these successful rollouts have sparked material NDR uplifts, notably in 2022 after the launch of FigJam, and again in 2024 following the launch of Dev Mode. We view Figma's product development motion and subsequent ability to cross-sell into its existing base as a strength of the business, and expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters and years across new design categories, genAI, and other related categories.

AI: opportunity or threat? Category leadership has not insulated Figma (and other software peers) from the "SaaS is dead" debate, particularly considering the category is primed for AI use-cases, evidenced by OpenAI partnerships with not only Figma but also Adobe and Canva within the "Apps in ChatGPT" ecosystem. On one hand, as design becomes easier to accomplish and LLMs generate production-ready or near-production-ready UI/UX, there is a credible risk of consolidated seat counts. On the other hand, we see Figma leading this motion towards automation through Figma Make and integrations with ChatGPT, which present the opportunity to activate a new monetization engine. We expect AI monetization will remain a key consideration regarding the durability of recent growth trends.

2026 growth drivers and outlook. Figma's 2026 growth trajectory is driven by expanding horizontally into non-designer personas through new products like Figma Sites, Buzz, and Slides, converting its massive developer base into high-value paid seats through Dev Mode, and potential monetization of AI usage through a credit-based consumption model launching. Together, these factors will play a key role in larger customer cohort growth and NDR, which rebounded to above 130% in 3Q. As a recent IPO, we believe 2026 and 2027 Street estimates still reflect some level of conservatism, but also the lapping of pricing and packaging actions that took place in March 2025. However, starting on March 18, 2026, the company will begin to enforce seat credit limits for AI, providing a new vehicle for monetization as customers purchase more credits as an add-on or pay as you go.

Valuation. Even after the post-IPO pullback in shares, we believe current valuation levels point to a neutral risk/reward, considering the near-term overhang that we expect AI uncertainty will have on the name and the tougher comp set for 1H26. As one of only a few public SaaS companies trading at a double-digit 2027 revenue multiple, clean beat-and-raises are likely necessary over the course of the next year to sustain and potentially expand the current multiple. We expect to gain more clarity on the "AI opportunity versus threat" debate in the coming quarters as the company looks to drive further monetization of its tools. Finally, investors and ourselves continue to wrestle with the expectation of margins compressing next year as a result of AI and product investment, which is likely still being digested by many as we await a preliminary 2026 guide.

We believe Figma has solidified itself as the market-standard in the UI/UX design space, an industry that the company modernized by being the first to allow teammates to collaborate on projects simultaneously in a web-based environment. Figma's competitive moat is evidenced by the long and diverse list of digital experiences created within the platform, including those for Netflix, Slack, Spotify, Uber, and more. We see Figma as well-positioned to continue expanding its platform and increasing multi-product adoption, while also being a critical player shaping how the UI/UX design industry will evolve with the advent of genAI. For our full report please go to page 3.

Figma has emerged as a foundational platform in today's digital-first world where websites, mobile apps, interactive prototypes, and presentations define how we communicate, work, and engage. Before its founding, design workflows were fragmented and cumbersome. Designers relied on a patchwork of tools and were forced to manually hand off files between peers via email once their portion of the work was complete, creating bottlenecks and limiting simultaneous collaboration. Unlike industries such as gaming, which embraced multiplayer experiences in the late 1990s, or document editing, which saw real-time co-authoring with Google Docs in 2010, design remained largely siloed and static for years.

Figma was introduced by co-founders Dylan Field and Evan Wallace after growing up in a world where digital collaboration was becoming increasingly visible, recognizing the lack of collaborative tools for the design industry. After spending three years building, testing, and iterating with early users, Figma launched Figma Design in 2015, the first design tool that combined the accessibility of the web with the functionality and performance of a native desktop app. Since its launch, Figma has become the global standard platform in creating digital experiences, with most of the Fortune 500 leveraging the platform in some fashion today. Figma has played an essential role in the creation of the digital ecosystem we know today, with over 540,000 customers using the platform today to build websites, applications, digital product prototypes, presentations, and more. In fact, every day, billions of people around the world interface with digital experiences created within Figma.

This widespread adoption reflects more than just product-market fit, it marks a cultural shift in how digital products are conceived and built. By reimagining design as a collaborative, browser-based experience, Figma didn't just improve workflows, it fundamentally changed the culture of digital experience development. Designers, developers, and product managers are now able to work side-by-side in a shared canvas, reducing friction, accelerating iteration cycles, and enabling faster decision-making. Figma has become the connective tissue of modern digital experience development; a shared canvas where ideas evolve, teams align, and innovation happens.

Figma is the market leader in collaborative UI/UX design tools. Organizations turn to Figma to streamline interface design workflows, foster seamless cross-functional collaboration, and accelerate the entire design-to-development lifecycle. Its web-native and cloud-hosted platform empowers teams to design, prototype, and iterate digital experiences in real-time. By centralizing work in a single, collaborative environment, Figma helps eliminate silos between design, engineering, and product teams, driving faster, more aligned outcomes. Some of the most notable digital experiences that have been created in Figma include Netflix, Duolingo, DoorDash, Peloton, ServiceNow, Google Maps, Uber, Airbnb, among over half a million other paid customers.

Figma estimates that its total addressable market today is $33 billion across the 'global workforce engaged in software design,' as defined by IDC. To ground this estimate, Figma sponsored an IDC Executive Spotlight titled, 'Global Workforce Engaged in Software Design Expands to 144 Million by 2029'. In the report, the IDC noted that in 2025, 107 million employees are in some way involved in software design, including 72 million knowledge workers and 24 million developers. By 2029, software design-involved knowledge workers will total 95 million (+7.1% CAGR) while software design-involved developers will total 49 million (+9.0%), for a total of 144 million workers involved in software design (+7.8% CAGR). The mix of knowledge workers, which currently makes up 67% of the software-design involved workforce, includes marketers (28% of total knowledge workers involved in software design), product management (14%), brand design (11%), UX design (5%), and other (42%).

Internal pricing data was also applied to configure the TAM but based on its $33 billion TAM and 107 million addressable seat estimates, we can triangulate that Figma estimates an average seat price of $308, which blends together various plan and seat types. Based on these estimates, it is clear that Figma has room to grow much further into its TAM from both a seat count and upsell perspective. On seat counts, we know that Figma has 13 million+ monthly active users, which only scratches the surface in comparison to the 107 million employees who are in some way involved in software design.

All in all, and evidenced by market-leading growth metrics, Figma is not TAM-constrained by any stretch in our view. The IDC estimates that 1 billion new logical applications will be available worldwide by 2028 [US51953724] versus 635.8 million in 2025 (Source: IDC: 1 Billion New Logical Applications: More Background, US51953724, April 2024). We agree with the sentiment that the explosion in applications is only gaining steam and believe the introduction of genAI and more specifically vibe-coding opens the door to the creation of applications at a faster pace than ever before. With this explosion in apps, we believe Figma will stand as a beneficiary considering its critical role in the user interface configuration process.

Figma's platform began with Figma Design, which launched in 2015 using WebGL technology to bring design into the browser for the first-time, unlocking real-time collaboration. Since launching Figma Design, the company has significantly expanded its product offering to address the complete digital experience project lifecycle, from ideation, to visualization, to building and shipping. Figma's strong product development motion was on display in 2025, as the company doubled its product offering with the launches of Sites, Make, Buzz, and Draw. Despite the relative infancy of the broader platform outside of Figma Design, more than 80% of customers use two or more products (2Q25), and more than 70% of customers were using three or more products in 3Q25.

Figma Design is the company's flagship product, enabling collaborative user interface and user experience design for web, mobile, and software applications. Figma Design is used in the visualization stage of the digital experience creation lifecycle and was launched in 2015. At the visualization stage, designers look to rapidly explore concepts and express their ideas without constraint. With those requirements in mind, Figma Design was created with a wide range of features that make it possible to design and prototype ideas with high fidelity, including typography features or vector editing capabilities that add texture and dimension to designs.

Used in the ideation phase, FigJam was the second product launched by the company when brought to market in 2021. FigJam is the company's online whiteboard that allows teams to brainstorm and ideate simultaneously within the same workspace. To harvest a collaborative and easy-to-use process and application, FigJam offers functionalities such as sticky notes, flowcharts, and voting tools, among other interactive widgets. The tool is frequently used alongside Figma Design during the early stages of product development and planning. FigJam is included with all seats on every plan.

Dev Mode is a dedicated space in Figma that helps transform design concepts into coded products. Compared to Figma Design that was built for free-form design testing and exploration, Dev Mode is tailored to the specific and structured needs of developers. Dev Mode streamlines developer handoff, providing developers with an optimized view for inspecting designs, extracting assets, and accessing code snippets in languages such as CSS, Swift, and React. Dev Mode also enables comparison between design versions and supports integration with design tokens, improving design-to-code alignment and reducing the need for external tools. Dev Mode was launched in 2023. As of 1Q25, 30% of Figma's MAUs were developers.

Launched in 2024, Figma Slides was born from an organic use-case in which Figma users were creating millions of slide presentations within Figma Design. Slides allows users to shape their slide decks in an easy-to-use interface, giving creators the ability to toggle to Design Mode to use Figma Design features like Auto Layout, the layers panel, and advanced properties. As is the standard for Figma products, Slides gives teams the opportunity to collaborate within the same project.

Announced at Config 2025 where the company doubled its product portfolio, Figma Draw allows users to create designs with illustration tools, vector editing, and more effects. Figma Draw is often used in tandem with Figma Design within the visualization phase. Draw allows users to create natural pen strokes and freeform shapes, which can later be converted into editable vector objects.

Announced at Config 2025, Figma Buzz allows users to develop brand assets, such as social media posts, digital ads, event materials, one-pagers, fliers, and more. It uses templates, brand guidelines, and AI-powered features to streamline asset creation while maintaining consistency across campaigns. Buzz integrates directly into the Figma ecosystem, enabling seamless collaboration between designers, marketers, and stakeholders.

Announced at Config 2025, Figma Sites is a no-code website publishing tool that allows users to turn design files into simple, deployable websites. Figma Sites has the necessary tools required for teams to design, prototype, and publish all in one place. Figma offers pre-built blocks, allowing designers to structure pages with auto layout built-in. From there, designers can add custom styles to craft original web experiences.

The final product announced at Config 2025 was Figma Make. Figma Make is Figma's primary genAI product that turns a prompt into a fully-functioning prototype. By leveraging generative AI, Figma Make enables faster ideation, positioning Figma alongside broader industry trends toward AI-assisted productivity in creative tools. Figma Make can create a prototype from scratch, or can be augmented with an existing Figma design. Figma Make, among other genAI features throughout the broader platform, primarily relies on off-the-shelf foundational models, but Figma expects the development of their own models to accelerate over time as the company makes investments in AI.

The company's subscription agreements are primarily contracted on monthly or annual terms, billed in advance, and are non-cancellable. The company offers different seat types and plans that are tailored to the specific needs of different users and organizations. The company bills in five currencies: U.S. dollars, Euros, British pounds, Japanese Yen, and Canadian dollars.

 Starter Figma's free-to-use plan, which is designed for working on personal projects. Figma's Starter Plan gives users free access to all products outside of Dev Mode. Users can create up to three files per product within a team or project but get unlimited personal drafts, however, Starter users can only invite collaborators to drafts with view-only access. Includes limited AI credits.  Professional Designed for individuals and small teams. Professional plans grant users access to unlimited files and projects, plus design libraries for single teams. Includes 3,000 AI credits/mo for Full seat.  Organization Designed for businesses with multiple teams. Gives users access to one Figma workspace with centralized admin and security features. Organization plans were launched in 2018. Includes 3,500 AI credits/mo for Full seat.  Enterprise Designed for businesses managing multiple products or brands. Enterprise grants users custom team workspaces, automated design system management, and enterprise-level controls and compliance. Enterprise plans were launched in 2022. Includes 4,250 AI credits/mo for Full seat.

There were 70% of new Organization and Enterprise plan customers in 2024 and in 1Q included at least one user who was previously a member of a Professional plan, displaying that Figma often exists within an organization before broader adoption. We believe much opportunity remains ahead for Figma to grow smaller accounts into larger, managed accounts with more seats and more products. In 2024 and 1Q, Organization and Enterprise plans represented 70% of revenue. As a final note on plan types, Pro is free for educators and students through the company's education program, while Organization plans are free for K-12 students and teachers. Seat types were launched in March 2025 to reduce the complexity of managing licenses, account details, and other admin functions. Through the launch of seat types, customers can now buy multi-product seats tailored to needs of different users. FigJam and Slides are included in every paid seat.

 The Viewer seat allows users to view files and leave comments for free.  The Collab seat gives access to FigJam and Figma Slides.  The Content seat gives access to Figma Buzz, Figma Sites CMS, FigJam, and Figma Slides. Content seats are not yet available for purchase.  The Dev seat gives access to Dev Mode, in addition to FigJam, Figma Slides, and Figma Buzz.  The Full seat gives access to all of Figma Design, Figma Draw, Figma Make, Dev Mode, Figma Buzz, Figma Sites, FigJam, and Figma Slides. The company increased prices on the Full seat, effective March 11, for the first time. The effective increase ranges from 20-33%.

Core buyers of Figma include cross-functional teams such as designers, developers, product managers, researchers, marketers, and writers, highlighting the platform's broad appeal across organizational roles. Notably, two-thirds of Figma's 13 million monthly active users in 1Q25 consisted of non-designers, showcasing its adoption beyond design-focused teams. Adoption is not limited by company size, as Figma is used by some of the largest organizations in the world to build user experiences interfaced by millions per day, as well as by individuals and SMBs typically leveraging Starter or Professional.

Figma serves over 540,000 paid customers globally as of 3Q25, including 12,910 customers with >$10k ARR and 1,262 customers with >$100k ARR. Additionally, Figma had more than 40 customers with ARR exceeding $1 million as of 1Q25. The company's customer base includes 78% of the Forbes Global 2000, although only 24% of these companies spend over $100,000 annually on Figma, presenting a substantial expansion opportunity within the company's existing user base. Finally, 95% of Fortune 500 businesses leverage Figma. Despite the presence of large customers, Figma's top ten customers combined for less than 10% of revenue in 2023 and 2024.

Figma's revenue mix is diversified geographically and across customer segments. Approximately 85% of monthly active users in 1Q25 were outside the US, but only 53% of revenue came from international markets, indicating 1) the significant monetization opportunity that remains outside of the US, and 2) the strength of the company's product-led-growth motion that has led to strong international adoption despite efforts to build international sales teams only coming more recently. As for industry-specific exposure, the company has not provided specific details on any industries the company is more or less exposed to. After all, the company is found in 19 out of every 20 Fortune 500 companies. Still, given the nature of the product, it is likely that Figma is more exposed to industries with large digital footprints and significant investments in digital transformation. These include tech, retail, banking, and CPG.

At the lower end of the market, Figma leverages a product-led growth motion supported by its collaborative browser-based platform, which drives organic adoption through features that allow users to invite collaborators. This motion is complemented by an effective selfservice model, with marketing efforts spanning livestreams, YouTube, social media, in-product promotions, and email campaigns to drive user engagement and adoption. Additionally, the company hosts two major user conferences coined 'Config' each year. Config in San Francisco and London each took place in May this year. Figma's direct sales motion, established in 2018 with the launch of the Organization plan, was designed to serve larger customers. The sales team collaborates with customer champions and solutions consultants to scale adoption within enterprises. Approximately 70% of revenue in 2024 and 1Q25 came from Organization and Enterprise plans, with a significant portion of new customers having previously used the Professional plan, highlighting the platform's inherent scalability and land-and-expand success.

Since growing a sales team, the company has made efforts to expand its footprint internationally, first by launching the company's first office outside of the US in London in 2020, and then subsequently opening offices in Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, Singapore, and Australia in the years following. The company also benefits from an expanding partner ecosystem. Collaboration partners include companies like Microsoft, Atlassian, Zoom, Notion, and Linear, while the company also boasts integrations with tools like GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Storybook. The partnerships generate product awareness for Figma, on top of the obvious benefits to the user experience.

Source: Company materials As seen in Exhibit 8 above, the company benefits significantly from best-in-class net dollar retention (131% in 3Q25). As already highlighted, 70% of new Organization and Enterprise plan customers in 2024 and in 1Q included at least one user who was previously a member of a Professional plan, displaying that Figma often exists within an organization before broader adoption. The company's global sales and marketing teams work hand-in-hand with Figma's expanding network of customer champions to scale Figma usage within organizations to increase adoption across plans. Additionally, Figma has faced net dollar retention tailwinds by bringing new products to market. For example, in 2024, net dollar retention rate improved +12 points year-over-year driven by the launch of Dev Mode, displaying to us customer willingness to quickly deploy new products post-launch. CAGRs by Annual Cohort as seen in Exhibit 8 as of 1Q include:  2020 - 46%  2021 - 31%  2022 - 22%

From a gross margin standpoint, the company is best-in-class, with 89.8% non-GAAP gross margins over the trailing twelve-months period (3Q25). With that said, gross margins have compressed, coming down from 91.8% on a TTM basis in 3Q24. Gross margins are expected to remain pressured as the company does not enforce credit limits on full seats or charge for consumption add-ons around Figma Make generations.

Operating margins have historically showed strong seasonal volatility, with 2Q being an extreme low-point of the year, followed by seasonally high operating margins in 2H. The dip in operating margin in 2Q each year is driven by the company's conference, Config. Over the past two years, the company has made strides in improving operating profitability. With that said, the company is currently guiding to a significant deterioration in operating margins this year. We are modeling a 570bp y/y decrease in operating margins for the full-year 2025, with further deterioration in 2026. While the company reiterated its growth philosophy around 'growing responsibly' on its inaugural earnings call, the team also called out that investors should see 'significant investments in our AI efforts' and expectations for margins to come down in the near-term as the company 'invests in the long-term.' We expect the company's expectations around profitability to be one of the largest overhangs on the name for the foreseeable future as investors continue to put greater emphasis on profitability.

Thus far in 2025, Figma has made three acquisitions. In 2Q, the company acquired Payload, a headless CMS and application framework designed to improve collaboration among developers, marketers, and product owners. The company had previously raised $5.5 million in funding. Figma also acquired a company called Modyfi in 2Q, which is an AI-native image editing and design platform. Modyfi had previously raised $31.9 million across four rounds of funding since 2021. In 2023, Figma acquired Diagram, which was an AI-powered solution for design workflows within Figma, and in 2021, acquired Visly, a tool for developing UI components in React. Finally, in 3Q, the company announced the acquisition of Weavy. Weavy is an AI-powered platform for image and video editing founded in 2024. Weavy allows users to compose AI model outputs with professional editing tools, allowing users to 'mold (AI model) outputs like clay.' Figma will continue to operate Weavy as a standalone product, but Figma is evaluating how they intend to integrate

Weavy into its platform. According to Crunchbase, Weavy has raised $4 million since its founding. While acquisitions have been primarily tuck-in to-date, in CEO Dylan Field's founder letter he wrote, 'Expect us to take big swings when we see a chance to invest in our platform or pursue M&A at scale.' Given that commentary, and the fact that Figma just recently acquired two companies in 2Q, we believe M&A is increasingly becoming a bigger part of the Figma story.

Paid Customers with more than $10,000 in ARR Relative to most other companies that provide a similar metric, we see quarter-toquarter improvements here as more of a factor of multi-product adoption or plan-type upsell rather than an indication that the company is finding success landing larger (by employee size) customers. We say this because Figma already boasts strong attach rates upmarket, with 95% of the Forbes 500 and 78% of the Global 2000 having already adopted Figma in some fashion. Exhibit 10: Figma >$10k ARR Customer Count Chart Source: Company materials, Stifel formatting

Source: Company materials, Stifel formatting Paid Customers with more than $100,000 in ARR Similarly to the >$10k ARR cohort group, Figma's >$100k cohort is likely also dependent on customer upsell in the coming quarters and years, considering the ubiquity of Figma within upmarket organizations already today. To give this cohort more context, we call out that of the 1,000+ customers that currently spend >$100k on an ARR basis, only 40 are over $1 million ARR, according to the company as of 1Q25. Exhibit 12: Figma >$10k ARR Customer Count Chart Source: Company materials, Stifel formatting

Source: Company materials, Stifel formatting Net Dollar Retention Rate While the metric is still a key one to keep an eye on to gauge upsell behavior, we note that it may not prove as useful as what other companies provide considering the metric only looks at customers with more than $10,000 in ARR as of the twelve months prior to the date of measurement. So, the metric only accounts for ~2-3% of the company's total customer base.

Figma's competition ranges from companies that cater to multiple stages of the design and development process to point solutions that address specific parts of the process. Figma faces the risk that these point solution providers eventually expand to cater to the entire lifecycle of the design and development process. We highlight some of the most notable competitors below:

Adobe Recall, Adobe announced its intention to acquire Figma in September 2022, a deal valued at $20 billion. The deal was mutually terminated in December 2023, with the companies citing no clear path to regulatory approval, which led to Adobe paying Figma a $1 billion termination fee. The attempted acquisition was pitched by Adobe management to investors as a way to make content creation more efficient, collaborative, and fun, to accelerate Adobe's move to the web, advance Adobe's product design capabilities, and expand and empower Adobe's community. While the attempted acquisition provided a clear window into Adobe's perceived gaps in its product portfolio, Adobe remains a principal competitor to Figma. Adobe most directly competes with Figma through its vector-based user experience design tool, XD, which launched in 2016. Management described this business's revenue as de-minimis when attempting to acquire Figma, and eventually removed its ability to sell as a standalone product. XD is currently in maintenance mode, meaning no new features are being developed, while bug fixes and security updates will continue. One of Adobe's current largest initiatives is in

the development of Express, the company's light-weight, web-first content creation platform. While core Figma use-cases like UI/UX design and prototyping are not effectively addressed by Express and customers we speak with typically see Adobe and Figma as in two distinct categories, we do call out that Express, among other Adobe products, competes for mindshare among users who need fast, collaborative visual content creation, particularly in use-cases like marketing, social media, and branding. Finally, at its 2025 MAX Conference in October, Adobe announced Firefly Boards, a digital mood board and brainstorming space, which seems to serve as a direct competitor to FigJam. Sketch Netherlands-based Sketch was launched in 2010 and quickly became one of the first modern digital design tools tailored specifically for UI/UX workflows. Sketch pioneered many of the features now considered standard in interface design, such as artboards,

Americas - Software: Applications symbols, and vector editing optimized for screen design, and was widely adopted by designers, particularly in the Apple ecosystem due to its macOS exclusivity which continues today. While Sketch was initially dominant in the UI design space, its market position was challenged by the rise of Figma, which offered real-time collaboration, cross-platform accessibility, and a more modern cloud-first architecture. Sketch remains a competitor to Figma, though its relevance has narrowed. Markets accept Sketch as a legacy tool, though it is still used in some design-centric organizations, but is increasingly replaced by Figma for collaborative workflows and scalability across product teams.

Canva Canva, which was founded in 2013 in Sydney, Australia, has grown into one of the most widely used online design platforms globally, particularly among non-designers and marketing teams, with 230 million users, including 25 million that are paid. Canva's core value proposition centers around ease of use, offering drag-and-drop tools, templates, and a vast content library for

creating presentations, social media graphics, videos, and other visual assets. While Canva does not directly compete with Figma in UI/UX design or product prototyping, similar to Adobe Express who it more directly competes with, it increasingly overlaps with Figma in adjacent usecases like collaborative content creation and visual communication. In recent years, Canva has expanded its platform to include Canva Whiteboards, a collaborative space for brainstorming and planning, and Canva Docs, a visual document editor. These additions position Canva as a more direct competitor to FigJam. Canva also launched its Visual Worksuite, a suite of productivity tools aimed at replacing traditional office software with design-first alternatives. While Canva's tools are not built for interface design or developer handoff, they compete for user attention in workflows where speed, simplicity, and collaboration are prioritized over precision and technical depth, again, in a similar boat with Adobe Express. Canva's competitive posture is strongest in marketing, education, and small business environments, where teams need to produce branded content quickly and collaboratively.

Miro -Miro, originally founded as RealtimeBoard in 2011 and rebranded in 2019, is a San Francisco-based company offering a leading online whiteboard platform for visual collaboration. While Miro does not compete with Figma's core design and prototyping capabilities, it is a direct competitor to FigJam, in the whiteboarding tool arena. Miro's platform includes features like sticky notes, templates, integrations with tools like Jira and Slack, and support for large-scale enterprise deployments. Its strength lies in enabling distributed teams to collaborate visually in real time, making it a key player in the broader collaborative design, particularly in the early stages of product development and planning.

Framer -Framer, founded in 2014 in Amsterdam, began as a prototyping tool for designers and has since evolved into a full-featured nocode website builder. The platform allows users to design and publish responsive websites directly from the canvas, combining visual design with production-ready code, similar to Figma Sites. While Framer does not compete with Figma in traditional UI/UX design workflows or team-based product design, it overlaps in high-fidelity prototyping and interactive web experiences, particularly for marketing sites and landing pages. Framer's strength lies in enabling designers to go from concept to live site without developer involvement.

Figma's dominant market position displays competitive moat. Based on conversations with Figma customers, research done by industry participants like UX Tools, and the company's own disclosures on adoption within the Fortune 500 and Global 2000, it is clear that Figma is the market-standard in the UI/UX design platform space. Customers we have spoken with ahead of our launch point to a lack of viable competitors, particularly following Adobe's decision to put Adobe XD in maintenance mode, another sign that Figma's competitive moat has become wider in recent years.

Monetization efforts have room to be optimized, particularly internationally. Firstly, we call out the fact that seat types (we highlighted in Exhibits 5 & 6 ) were only launched in March 2025. We believe the launch of seat types reduces the complexity of managing licenses, account details, and other administrative functions, potentially promoting quicker decision-making processes from enterprises and better retention outcomes as optimal bundles are highlighted. Secondly, disclosures around international lead us to believe strong monetization opportunity remains. As a reminder, 85% of MAU were outside of the US, but only 53% of revenue comes from outside of the US, indicating per-user monetization internationally has room to improve.

Product development motion has proven to be best-in-class and customers have shown eagerness to adopt new products from Figma. Firstly, we highlight that 81% of customers are using 2+ products while 70% are using 3+ products, underscoring strong crossproduct engagement and validating Figma's ability to expand wallet share within accounts. Secondly, we call out that bringing new products to market has had a quick, positive impact on net retention in the past. For example, in 2024, net dollar retention rate improved +12 points year-over-year driven by the launch of Dev Mode, displaying to us customer willingness to quickly deploy new products postlaunch. This level of multi-product usage is particularly notable given the recent launches of Draw, Buzz, Sites, and Make. The company has consistently shipped high-impact features, driven by CEO Dylan Field and the rest of the product team.

Valuation implies continuation of outsized growth and is 'priced to perfection' to an extent. While valuation concerns continue as shares have pulled back considerably since the company's IPO, Figma remains one of the most expensive public software companies on an EV/Revenue basis, trading at 11.0x our 2027 revenue estimate. With that being said, the premium to market peers is largely deserved considering its leading growth in recent periods and growth potential moving forward, with our estimates showing nearly 40% growth this year, and the bar set low for 2026 and 2027 in the 20% range. We expect these forward estimates to prove conservative, but note that to maintain the premium, estimates will likely need to be revised higher over the course of next year.

Adobe, Canva, AI-native startup, or other competitors may infringe on Figma's market opportunity. While we continue to believe Figma is the clear leader in the UI/UX and prototyping design market, infringement on the opportunity from adjacent players such as Adobe and Canva, or any other competitors is a risk. We also note that as AI tools built for software development uses-cases improve, barriers to entry in the SaaS market may decrease. Seat-based pricing model puts Figma at risk of AI disruption. The proliferation of AI tools in the creative and design market could pressure the overall headcount of Figma's core market. This scenario would likely lead to less users of its software, and the growth prediction of the designer industry could prove inaccurate. While Figma could pivot away from a seat-based pricing model, something the company has already foreshadowed, this could introduce disruption within current customers at renewal, as well as the company's netnew business engine.

We are initiating coverage of Figma with a Hold rating and $40 target price. Our target price is based on an 11.8x EV/Revenue multiple based on our 2027 revenue estimate. We believe Figma commands a premium multiple in the software space given its clear leadership position, its ability to grow >30% organically in the mid-term, and the potential for new generative AI products and integrations like Make and integrations with ChatGPT to support the company's next leg of growth. We believe Figma is well-positioned to maintain its leading market share in a market that is becoming increasingly important as entities expand their digital footprint and differentiate themselves with superior user experiences. Risks to our target price include an increase in competition and potential disruption to the company's seatbased pricing model through the proliferation of genAI tools.

Our $40 target price is based on an 11.8x EV/Revenue multiple based on our 2027 revenue estimate. In our view, Figma is poised to build on its category leadership in design through recent product additions and the proliferation of AI functionality. We see an appealing opportunity for share gains through a combination of net new customer acquisition and expansion through new products and the pricing and packaging actions the company undertook last Spring. As we move into 2026, we expect the role of AI in the creative and design spaces and Figma's ability to capitalize on and monetize its own solutions like Make will remain a key component of the debate around the durability of high growth trends. Despite our positive view on the company's competitive positioning and addressable opportunity, we await a more favorable risk/reward setup at current valuation levels. Risks to our target price include an increase in competition and potential disruption to the company's seat-based pricing model through the proliferation of genAI tools.
