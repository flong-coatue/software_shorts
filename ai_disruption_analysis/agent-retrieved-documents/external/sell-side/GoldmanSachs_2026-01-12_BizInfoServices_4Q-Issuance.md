Debt issuance volume growth decelerated in 4Q from 3Q levels, prompting us to trim our 4Q ratings revenue growth forecasts for S&P and Moody's. Global debt issuance volumes rose 3% y/y in 4Q, softening from 20% growth in 3Q, with robust corporate investment grade and high yield issuance partially o ff set by declines in corporate leveraged loan and structured fi nance issuance. Debt issuance was up 4% in 2025. We trim our 4Q estimates for ratings revenue growth to 11% y/y from ~12.5% at SPGI and to 11% from 13% at MCO. We expect SPGI Ratings revenue growth to land in the upper half of management's full year 2025 guidance of 6.5-8.5% and MCO's MIS revenue growth to come slightly below guidance of high-single-digits. Private credit, which is not captured in our debt issuance tracker, has the potential to drive upside to

ratings revenue at SPGI and MCO. We reiterate our Buy ratings on SPGI and MCO given ratings revenue strength, our expectations of compounding EPS growth in the low-to-mid teens, and strong positioning with AI given product innovation initiatives and signi fi cant proprietary data.

Global debt issuance volumes rose in 4Q. Debt issuance volumes increased low-single-digits y/y in 4Q led by robust investment grade issuance. Global debt issuance grew 3% y/y in 4Q, decelerating from a 20% increase in 3Q, with tailwinds including increased re fi nancing activity in a declining interest rate environment and higher M&A volumes. By month, debt issuance declined 2% y/y in October, increased 31% in November and decreased 30% y/y in December. Global debt issuance was up 4% in 2025, compared to full year 2025 guidance of mid-single-digit rated debt issuance growth at MCO and high-single-digit billed issuance growth at S&P. For reference, SPGI's reported billed debt issuance, which excludes frequent issuer issuance and includes private credit issuance, was up 36% y/y in October and 30% in November.

Strong investment grade issuance growth. Corporate debt issuance was strong in 4Q in the investment grade category. Global investment grade issuance grew 120% y/y in 4Q, registering the fastest pace of growth since 2Q 2020, driven by opportunistic issuance and a recovery in M&A volume. Meanwhile, global high yield issuance grew a healthy 21% y/y in 4Q on re fi nancing volumes but decelerated from 56% growth in 3Q, while corporate leveraged loan issuance declined 41% in 4Q, in fl ecting negatively from 72% growth in 3Q. Global fi nancial institutions issuance expanded 2% y/y in 4Q, decelerating from 9% growth in 3Q, and structured fi nance

Corporate leveraged loan and structured issuance data tends to lag by an additional 1-2 weeks compared to other categories, suggesting their growth may be revised higher than initially presented.

North America debt issuance underperformed other regions. Overall debt issuance in North America underperformed other regions in 4Q. North America debt issuance decreased 6% y/y in 4Q compared to 22% growth in EMEA and 14% growth in APAC. North America debt issuance in 4Q was driven by a 177% y/y increase in corporate investment grade and 55% growth in corporate high yield, o ff set by a 44% decline in corporate leveraged loans, 11% decrease in fi nancial institutions and 27% decrease in structured fi nance. EMEA debt issuance expansion in 4Q was driven by a 59% y/y increase in corporate investment grade, 30% increase in fi nancial institutions and 34% expansion in structured fi nance. APAC debt issuance was lifted by 61% y/y growth in corporate investment grade and 32% growth in structured fi nance. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Healthy debt issuance growth outlook. We forecast healthy mid-single-digit debt issuance volume growth in 2026, led by the US markets. Our outlook is composed of US investment grade and high yield issuance of $1.9tn and $400bn, respectively, representing 5% and 20% growth, as well as Euro investment grade and high yield 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

issuance of €725bn and €125bn, representing a 10% decline and fl at performance. Key growth drivers include a $5tn+ US and EMEA corporate re fi nancing wall through 2029, with 4-year rolling investment grade maturities up 5% y/y and speculative grade maturities up 7%, in addition to accelerating M&A activity, with YTD announced volumes up 43% y/y through December 2025. Declining US policy rates from 4.13% in 3Q 2025 to 3.13% by 4Q 2026 based on our economists' forecasts should further support debt issuance, as historically every 100 bps cut adds ~15% of corporate debt issuance growth.

Lowering 4Q estimates for SPGI and MCO. Based on 4Q debt issuance performance, we are lowering our estimates for S&P and Moody's. For SPGI, we lower our 4Q Ratings revenue growth estimate to 11.1% y/y from 12.4% previously. On a full year basis, we expect SPGI Ratings revenue to increase 8.0% in 2025, compared to 8.3% prior, landing in the upper half of management's 6.5-8.5% 2025 ratings revenue growth guidance. We separately increase our SPGI Index segment revenue growth forecast from 4.0% y/y to 8.0% in 4Q based on strong AUM growth of ETFs linked to S&P indices of 23% in 4Q, accelerating from 22% growth in 3Q. For MCO, we lower our 4Q MIS revenue growth estimate to 11.0% y/y from 13.3% previously. On a full year basis, we expect MCO MIS revenue to increase 7.3%, compared to 7.8% prior, marginally below management's high-single-digit growth guidance. We also increase our total company

4Q operating margin forecasts for SPGI by 30 bps to 47.0% to account for strong operating leverage 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 from Indices revenue growth and maintain our MCO EBITDA margin forecast for MCO at 47.1%. 2026 ratings revenue outlook for S&P and Moody's. We expect ratings revenue at S&P and Moody's to sustain healthy growth in 2025 driven by a strong debt re fi nancing pipeline, a rebound in M&A volumes, lower interest rates and private credit. On a full year basis, we estimate SPGI Ratings and MCO MIS revenue will increase 8% in 2026.

S&P Global (SPGI, Buy): We lower our 12-month price target from $640 to $638 based on 28.75x (unchanged) our NTM + 1YR EPS estimate of $22.19 ($22.26 prior). Our target multiple comes above the Info Services peer group median of 23.5x re fl ecting S&P's strong track record of execution, idiosyncratic opportunity for revenue and cost synergy realization from the IHS Markit merger, wide competitive moat due to its proprietary and essential data, and higher EBITDA margins relative to peers. Risks include a moderation in debt issuance volume growth, fi nancial services budget and headcount pressures that could weigh on Market Intelligence growth, a market pull-back that could put downward pressure on Indices growth, and FX risk.

Moody's (MCO, Buy): We raise our 12-month price target from $570 to $603 based on 34.0x (32x prior) our NTM + 1YR EPS estimate of $17.73 ($17.82 prior). We increase our target multiple to re fl ect MCO's leverage to a healthy medium-term debt issuance and ratings revenue outlook. Our target NTM P/E multiple comes above our Info Services peer group median of 23.5x, re fl ecting Moody's wide competitive moat, leverage to strong secular tailwinds in ratings, strong positioning with AI and attractive growth outlook in the MA segment. Risks include macro uncertainty, a slowdown in M&A volumes, higher interest rates, buy-side and sell-side budget pressures, ine ff ective execution of an AI strategy, and FX risk. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We, George K. Tong, CFA, Anna Wu, Sami Nasir, CFA and Alex Lakritz, hereby certify that all of the views expressed in this report accurately re fl ect our personal views about the subject company or companies and its or their securities. We also certify that no part of our compensation was, is or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the speci fi c recommendations or views expressed in this report. Unless otherwise stated, the individuals listed on the cover page of this report are analysts in Goldman Sachs' Global Investment Research division.

Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.
