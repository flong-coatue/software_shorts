Business and Information Services Business and Information Services - Market Weight Credit Bureaus - Market Overweight

January 7, 2026 Upgrading EXPN-GB to OP from PP, Top Pick MCO; Also Have Strong Preference for SPGI, FICO, TRU

In this 98-page slide deck, we update our views, price targets, and ratings heading into 2026. We are upgrading shares of EXPN-GB to Outperform from Peer Perform (see note here). Top picks for '26 include MCO/SPGI (slight preference towards MCO), FICO, and TRU.

● A Tough Year in the Rear View: 2025 was an uncharacteristically difficult year for Info Services stocks. While we saw relatively in-line performance during 1H, 2H delivered notable underperformance as fears around AI disintermediation began to take hold. We remain resolute in our belief that the fears around AI risk to Info Services companies' business models is overblown, and believe that 2026 can be the year that fundamentals become the main story again instead of narratives. We do not expect a sharp return to the valuation regime we saw pre-AI fears; however, assuming revenue/growth remains stable-to-improving across our space, we believe there is valuation upside for most names within our coverage universe (see pgs. 21-24). ● Top Picks for 2026: From a sub-sector perspective, we are most bullish on financial data/capital

markets companies as the debt issuance environment remains constructive (tight spreads, maturity wall, M&A volume) and equity markets appear primed for another year of positive performance. We are also constructive on the credit bureaus, but see greater upside from cap markets names. Our top pick for 2026 is MCO. While we have preferred SPGI on a relative basis (and still view it as an out-performer in '26), we believe that MCO can continue to hold its premium vs. SPGI in a positive debt issuance environment given a greater % of revenue exposed to ratings. We also view the setups for FICO (new pricing rolling in, conservative guide for FY26, view that Vantage does not take much share) and TRU (Financial Services ex-mortgage and Emerging Verticals strength) positively this year, along with CSGP (potential near-term catalyst from capital allocation committee outcome) and VRSK (still see 6-8% OCC revenue growth in 2026).

● We are upgrading EXPN-GB to Outperform from Peer Perform. We believe the mortgage market is likely to experience "normal" growth in 2026 with rates lower than last year, but remaining elevated, and believe that EXPN has proven it can compound organic revenue growth in the HSD range across various cycles. We believe investors may assign a premium valuation EXPN given its stable growth and strong structural positions in nonbureau areas such as consumer services, health, and auto. ● Investor Sentiment Survey Results: Investors see SPGI, MCO, FICO, and MSCI as top outperformers in '26, and PAYX, ADP, FDS, and IT as top underperformers (pgs 41-42, full survey results in our webcast tomorrow at 10am).

In 2025, the Wolfe Business and Information Services Index was down 14.8%, compared to the S&P 500 up 16.6%.

Business and Information Services (Market Weight): While our coverage universe underperformed the market and relevant indices during 2025, we see pockets of opportunities heading into 2026. We believe that a favorable debt issuance backdrop should favor names such as SPGI and MCO, and continued equity market appreciation can be a tailwind to SPGI and MSCI. On the credit bureaus side, we remain positive on FICO as we believe that the potential benefit from pricing changes remains underappreciated and that guidance is conservative. We also continue to like TRU given improving Emerging Verticals trends and a conservative guide. We are upgrading shares of EXPN-GB from Peer Perform to Outperform as we believe investors may begin to assign a premium valuation to a company that has proven it can compound at HSD organic top-line growth over various economic cycles. We are also Outperform rated on shares of VRSK and CSGP. We remain Peer Perform rated on ADP, BR, EFX, FA, and IT, and Underperform rated on FDS and PAYX .

Valuation: Our coverage universe is currently trading at a NTM P/E multiple of 23.1x, compared to its 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year median multiples of 28.2x, 27.6x, 28.0x, and 25.8x, respectively. This represents a 1.0x premium relative to the S&P 500 NTM P/E multiple, compared to its 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year median premiums of 6.1x, 7.0x, 7.5x, and 7.7x. Relative to the S&P 500 Equal-Weighted Index, our coverage is trading at a 6.1x premium, compared to its 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year median premiums of 11.2x, 11.3x, 11.5x, and 9.4x.

· While 2025 was a rough year for Business and Info Services stocks, we are positive on the space heading into 2026. We believe that the AI disintermediation narrative will gradually dissipate as most companies prove out with stable-to-improving fundamentals. We are most constructive on capital markets exposed names, but also constructive on the credit bureaus (with a preference for those with lower mortgage exposure). MCO is our top pick this year, with other high conviction calls being SPGI, FICO, and TRU. · With Capital Markets exposed names (SPGI, MCO, MSCI, FDS, BR), we expect the year to be marked by stronger-thanexpected debt issuance growth (corporate maturity wall, tight spreads, elevated M&A activity) and broader equity market/index appreciation.

· Regarding the Credit Bureaus/Scorers (EFX, EXPN, FICO, TRU), we believe that mortgage growth is likely to be more muted in 2026 year as the 10-year remains elevated (albeit lower than last year). We continue to prefer FICO given the magnitude of its CY26 price increases, and like TRU (improving Emerging Verticals Trends and Investor Day as potential catalyst). We also upgraded shares of EXPN as we believe investors may assign a premium valuation to the name given its consistent organic revenue growth profile. · For Payroll (ADP, PAYX) and Background Screening (FA), while multiples have come down vs. last year and believe downside is mostly protected, we believe that employment growth in the first half of the year could remain muted, capping upside potential for stocks exposed to labor market trends.

· Other Info Services (CSGP, VRSK, IT, CLVT): We prefer CSGP (potential near-term catalyst with results from Capital Allocation Committee meeting) and VRSK (expectations for slower growth in 4Q/1Q likely known at this point and in the stock with March Investor Day as a catalyst) and remain on the sidelines on IT and CLVT.

· Top Picks: · MCO (Outperform, $630): While we like both SPGI and MCO in 2026, we are shifting our relative preference towards MCO this year given our expectation that 2026 can be another positive year for debt issuance. Given MCO has a higher % of revenue and earnings exposed to debt issuance, we see greater magnitude of upside with Moody's this year. · SPGI (Outperform, $635): We believe SPGI has the potential to see upside to revenue and earnings from a constructive debt issuance backdrop and rising equity markets. That said, if debt issuance levels come in better-than-expected, we would expect the spread between SPGI and MCO not to narrow in 2026.

· FICO (Outperform, $2,050): We continue to view FICO as one of our higher conviction long calls this year as we see FY26 guidance as conservative and believe investors still underappreciate the magnitude of potential upside from new price increases on mortgage royalties. We also believe additional resellers will likely join the Direct License program. · TRU (Outperform, $110): We see upside to TRU's multiple if the company can prove out on sustaining HSD Emerging Verticals revenue growth, which we have conviction in given accelerating growth of non-financial verticals like marketing and telecom. We also view the upcoming March investor day as a positive catalyst. · Rating Change

· We are upgrading shares of EXPN-GB from Peer Perform to Outperform: We believe EXPN has proven that it can compound organic revenue growth in HSD range over various cycles, and we believe investors may assign a premium valuation to the company, especially if 2026 is another year of muted mortgage market growth. We are constructive on the growth trajectory for many of EXPN's non-bureau assets, including its Consumer Services, Auto, and Health businesses. We also believe that the LATAM bureau business can re-accelerate as we move throughout 2026 as the Brazilian Central Bank is expected to lower interest rates, which could help open up lending markets in the country.

· Key Themes and Questions Discussed in this Report: · Valuation (Pages 21-23): A new regime or is there room for multiples to move higher? · Debt Issuance (Pages 25-31): 2025 ended well, and we see tailwinds for strong growth in 2026. · Mortgage (Page 32): Will the mortgage market rebound in 2026, or will growth be muted? · Artificial Intelligence (Pages 33-35): Is there real risk to Info Services business models and how do we view relative risk across our coverage universe? · Fund Formation Trends (Page 36): Could we see greater fund formation in 2026 to help support MSCI Index Subscription demand? · Insurance (Page 37): P&C NWP growth expected to decelerate, but by how much (impacts for VRSK)?

· Debt Issuance: With MCO and SPGI being two of our top picks this year, we are relying on a constructive debt issuance backdrop to continue. If macro volatility increases and credit spreads begin to widen, we could see downside to our Ratings/MIS revenue estimates. · Credit Bureaus: If the mortgage market recovers and grows quicker than expected, EFX would likely outperform vs. TRU/EXPN, which would be against what our current ratings are. That said, FICO would also likely Outperform in this scenario. The bureaus and FICO could also see headwinds if regulatory noise from the FHFA picks up again. · Equity Market Underperformance: Our base assumption is that we see equity market appreciation next year akin to what would be considered a more normal year (HSD-LDD growth). However, like above, macro volatility could lead to equity underperformance, which could be a headwind for SPGI and MSCI Index revenues.

· Employment: If employment growth accelerates quicker than expected, we could see upside to numbers for ADP and PAYX. Further, if we see higher wage inflation than expected, we could see elevated voluntary attrition as employees look for higher paying jobs, which could be a tailwind for FA. · Insurance NWP Growth: If P&C NWP growth decelerates by more than what is expected, investors could turn more cautious on out-year growth at VRSK.

Source: Company documents, Wolfe Research. Data as of 1/6/2025. · Heading into 2026, one of the key debates revolves around the level of debt issuance growth we could see throughout the year after another year of strong growth in 2025. · When weighing dynamics around a still healthy corporate maturity wall, tight spreads, the potential for elevated capital markets activity (M&A/IPOs) vs. interest rate uncertainty and tougher comps, we believe the risk/reward still skews positively for issuance growth. · We currently model HSD Ratings/MIS revenue growth at SPGI and MCO against estimated comps of 8.2% and 7.7%, respectively.

DealLogic Debt Issuance Data -M/M Change compared to 5-year median M/M change. We believe M/M is currently the proper way to track recent trends as comps remain volatile. Corporate Maturity Wall remains healthy over the coming years (~$8tn through 2028), which should support continued growth in Ratings/MIS revenue over the medium-term. We believe that somewhere between 50-70% of corporate debt issued is used for refinancing purposes.

Debt Velocity -Measuring the % of debt issued compared to debt outstanding, we view debt velocity as another indicator of how much debt is being issued compared to historical levels.

Bond Spreads -Spreads on U.S. corporate debt remain tight relative to history, which we view as constructive for issuance. While the level of rates affects issuance levels, we believe spreads are more important for issuance volume, particularly from spec-grade issuers. Even if rates remain above 4%, we see a constructive environment for issuance if spreads are contained.

· Heading into 2026, we are not anticipating a material recovery in mortgage volumes. While we had been hopeful of a recovery in year T+1, as we enter 2026, we recognize a lower probability of this occurring with quarterly mortgage origination expectations for 2026 declining since September, now 11% lower than its initial 2026 forecast introduced about a year ago. We believe there is upside potential to our revised estimates if mortgage volumes return to growth sooner than expected, and we believe this is most likely to occur if the 10Y yield trends below 4% for a sustainable duration. · With mortgage exposed names (FICO, EFX, TRU, EXPN-GB), we expect a more normalized mortgage market growth rate to contribute to slightly slower revenue growth and less margin expansion than previously assumed, given mortgage-related revenue is typically higher margin than each respective consolidated business. We have a preference to FICO (price increase offsetting mortgage volume headwinds) and EXPN/TRU (lower mortgage exposure compared to EFX).

· 2H25 in our coverage universe was highlighted by concerns from investors around the risk that AI could pose to our space. · We believe this really 'kicked off' following FDS's F4Q25 print in September after the company guided below the Street on margins and signaled an upcoming investment cycle. · As shown in prior slides, our coverage de-rated notably in the last three months of the year, as fears around AI were not shaken off by positive 3Q25 earnings results. · While we understand certain data companies in our coverage universe have may not be 'proprietary' (i.e. consensus estimates at companies like FDS and SPGI), we believe a substantial portion of data that our companies have is either proprietary or contributory, and do not see AI posing a material risk to most companies in our coverage universe. · Further, many companies in our coverage universe operate in highly regulated industries (credit bureaus, insurance, banking), which we believe can also provide a degree of defensibility

Data as of 1/6/2025. - · While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact % of revenue coming from proprietary data at companies in our coverage universe, we attempt to categorize companies in our coverage into three buckets based on relative AI risk. Relative is important given we see low disruption risk overall for our space.

· Capital Markets Names (BR, MCO, MSCI, SPGI): Much of their businesses rely on proprietary data and research or have dominant market positions that would be tough to dislodge. Businesses like Ratings (SPGI/MCO) and asset servicing (BR) are highly regulated. · Credit Bureaus/Scorers (EFX, EXPN-GB, FICO, TRU): Rely on contributory data that is not publicly available and use their own methodologies and models to help develop credit file of a customer. FICO's scoring models rely on contributory data and are proprietary in our view. Industry also highly regulated. · VRSK: Operates in a highly-regulated vertical. Utilizes contributory data from carriers combined with proprietary software and analytic tools. · CSGP: CoStar suite comprised of unique and proprietary real estate industry data. Marketplaces rely on contributory data from agents along with proprietary data such as photos and digital twins. Source: Company documents, Wolfe Research. Data as of 1/6/2025.

· Payroll/Background Screeners (ADP, FA, PAYX): Don't see risk to business models from AI over the near-term, but possible that advances in AI cause structural shifts in the labor market over the longterm. That said, times of technology advancement in the past have also created new job opportunities. · CLVT: IP business can benefit from a long cycle of AI advancement and patents. Library of research in A&G business goes beyond what is publicly available, though possible some users may be able to use AI during earlier parts of a research process

· IT: Not seeing impacts yet but concerns that advancements in AI could cause customers who down-sold over the last year on macro/budget concerns to operate at a lower license-count level than previously. · FDS: Solutions around portfolio analytics/attribution and trading are proprietary but believe it has less proprietary data than peers. Investment cycle could pay off and result in a higher degree of proprietary data, though is a bit of a show-me story. Source: Company documents, Wolfe Research. Data as of 1/6/2025.

· As we begin 2026, one of the key debates revolves the impacts of a continued deceleration in P&C NWP on VRSK underwriting revenues. · NWP across the five largest P&C carriers are highly correlated with VRSK underwriting revenue; Street expectations of growth settling in the MSD range through 2027 indicate a potentially smaller headwind to VRSK.

On the ratings side, still favorable issuance trends should allow for MSD/HSD growth despite still elevated comps in 1H25. Market Intelligence revenue growth should also begin to improve towards medium-term targets throughout the year as well. We believe Index revenue growth should also see momentum through at least the first half of 2026 given strong equity market performance in 4Q. While Energy revenue growth is likely to be

muted during 1H as SPGI laps impacts from M&A and sanctioned entities, we believe these dynamics are well understood by investors. Lastly, we expect SPGI to complete the spin-off of its Mobility division in 2026 (expected 12-18 months following announcement in April 2025), which we believe can be accretive to the multiple as some of the post-INFO merger conglomerate discount goes away. On the margin side, we expect expansion at the low end of SPGI's 50-75bps/yr medium-term target as certain segment see a normalization off elevated revenue growth comps, though we still see consistent low-teens EPS growth, with the potential for upside if Ratings/Indices revenue growth comes in ahead of our model.

While shares are trading at ~29 2027 EPS, we believe that if current DCM conditions persist with tight spreads, we believe there could be upside to Street revenue and EPS estimates. We see a constructive environment coupled with easier comps in 1H leading to elevated MIS revenue growth in the first half of the year, with growth moderating towards more normalized levels in 2H. We believe another strong year of MIS revenue growth can

support continued margin expansion of 100bps+, leading to low-mid teens EPS growth. We see MA revenue growing in the 9% range, though believe ARR can accelerate from the 8% range seen in 2Q and 3Q25 as the company laps headwinds associated with lower government revenue, exiting a KYC re-distribution partnership, and consolidation in the insurance industry.

Following another positive year of equity market performance (and outperformance in non-U.S. markets), we believe we could see an increase in fund formation, helping index subscription revenue growth accelerate. Much of MSCI's growth in Index has come from asset-based fees in recent years, and while we believe investors are beginning to appreciate the sticky nature in ABF revenue, we believe an acceleration in index subscription revenue could get investors to assign a higher multiple to shares. We see DD growth in net new recurring subscription sales in 2025, mostly driven by Index, but also see solid trends in Analytics and Other Assets continuing. We believe Other Assets could be a source of upside this year as private asset analytics continues to gain demand

among investors/asset owners, and a potential CRE market recovery helps the RCA business. Overall, we believe MSCI can realize DD revenue growth in 2026, with operating leverage driving low teens EPS growth. · Key Debates and Questions: 1) What kind of impact could positive equity market performance in 2025 have on index subscription revenue growth in 2026? 2) Will the asset manager end market accelerate, or continue to grow in the MSD range? 3) How should we think about index subscription pricing for 2026? 4) How much can emerging growth areas such as hedge funds, fixed income, and wealth management contribute to top-line in 2026? · Where we Could be Wrong: Areas where we could be wrong include: 1) a downturn in equity market performance leading to lower-than-expected ABF revenue, 2) the asset manager end market decelerating from the stable MSD revenue growth we have seen in recent quarters, and 3) incremental competition in the private asset analytics space from peers/competitors.

· Thoughts into 2026: We believe that 2026 could be a better year from a capital markets perspective, which could lead to FDS realizing some degree of upside to current estimates. However, we believe the stock remains a show-me story given the company's ongoing investment cycle. FDS has noted investing more in its content and AI-related products, and while this could translate to gains over the medium-term, we believe it will take time for this to prove out in numbers. We believe concerns around AI disintermediation are falling for our space as a whole; however, we see FDS as having relatively higher AI risk vs. peers as we believe there is more proprietary data at others in the space. We do not believe that FDS will be a notable absolute underperformer like it was in 2025 when shares fell by more than 40%; however, we see investors continuing to assign a lower multiple to shares over the near-term, and believe upside is likely limited from here.

· Our fair value range for BR of $230-$270 is predicated on 21-25x our CY27 adjusted EPS estimate of $10.77. · Thoughts into 2026: We continue to see Broadridge as a stable, recurring revenue growth story that can compound revenue growth in the MSD-HSD range and EPS at ~10%. Secular drivers such as the democratization of investing, digitization of the wealth manager office, and increased demand for digital communication remain intact, and should help BR realize stable growth in the year ahead. We believe that fears around the impact of tokenized assets on BR's business are likely overblown as regulators will likely develop asset servicing requirements for tokenized equities. We do not believe that tokenized equities would cut BR out of the asset servicing cycle, even if individual investors do not necessarily own the underlying shares

of tokenized assets. We also do not see AI as a major risk for BR's business given the company's scale and breadth across financial services customers. While we believe secular tailwinds will remain and fears around potential headwinds likely overblown, we see valuation as full at current levels and believe there is greater magnitude of estimate and multiple upside with other names within our coverage universe.

Conversely, if equity markets see a sustained period of downside volatility, or tokenized assets growth faster-thanexpected before appropriate regulations are put in place, we could see downside to the numbers in our model.

· Thoughts into 2026: While we expected the mortgage environment to show recovery through the end of 2025 and into 2026, providing a lift to EFX's revenue growth and margins next year, the 10-year remains elevated despite 75bps in rate cuts, and with a mortgage volume recovery pushed back, we revise our revenue and adj EBITDA margin down slightly. We believe that we could see upside to our estimates for mortgage revenue growth if the 10-year treasury yield drops below 4% for a sustained period of time, which could also lead to incremental FCF for share repurchases and dividends. We believe that the OBBB will likely have more benefits than risks for the government vertical over the medium-long term, though benefits are likely to be seen more in 2H as provisions from the bill around states being more liable for errors rates and more frequent re-determinations on certain government programs begin to be implemented We remain positive on EFX's structural position and growth potential in verifications ex-mortgage but believe that shares may be range bound through the first half of the

year until we have more clarity on the trajectory of interest rates and would rather own one of the credit bureaus with less mortgage exposure. · Key Debates and Questions: 1) What level of mortgage inquiry growth could we see next year? 2) Vantage Score adoption and long-term impact, 3) Pricing power in EWS given perceived increased competition from others in the space, 4) any potential for disruption in the government vertical from changes enacted in the OBBB? · Where we Could be Wrong: Our views assume a relatively stable environment for mortgage in 2026 compared to prior expectations for a more material recovery, and the main area where we would be wrong is if the 10-year falls to a level that is more conducive to mortgage activity growth. If we were to enter a more positive environment for mortgage, EFX would likely stand to benefit more than the other credit bureaus given its higher mortgage exposure.

While the company has moderate mortgage exposure (lower than EFX, but higher than EXPN), we believe that TRU is executing well in U.S Financial Services ex-mortgage and its Emerging Verticals business. We believe that sustained HSD growth in EV can help improve sentiment on the story, as it can show that TRU is executing on the plan when it bought Neustar and Sontiq four years ago. We believe recent results suggest that HSD growth in EV can be sustained, as non-financial services end markets accelerated, compared to growth in EV previously being driven by Insurance. Elsewhere, we would expect India growth to begin to re-accelerate as macro uncertainty quiets down and the company laps impacts from the RBI tightening on credit late in 2024 and early 2025. Over the near-term we believe that TRU can come in ahead of guidance in 4Q as the macro environment has remained broadly stable,

with management previously noting that it would expect to meet or exceed its outlook is conditions from October persisted. TRU remains our top pick among the three credit bureaus, and we reiterate our Outperform rating on shares. · Key Debates and Questions: 1) What level of mortgage inquiry growth could we see next year, 2) Can Emerging Verticals sustain HSD growth in 2026? 3) When could we begin to see growth in India re-accelerate? 4) What will medium-term targets look like at the Investor Day in March? 5) Updated thoughts on capital allocation with Mexico acquisition still pending. · Where we Could be Wrong: We see two areas as to where we could be wrong on our TRU call. 1) If we enter a more constructive mortgage environment, EFX is likely to Outperform vs. TRU given its higher exposure to mortgage as % of revenue, particularly on the verifications side of the business. 2) If consumer lending remains tight and has knock on impacts on Emerging Verticals in areas such as ID&F, investors may get more cautious on the growth potential within that segment.

· Thoughts into 2026: We remain constructive on FICO into 2026 and view it as one of the top picks in our coverage universe. Putting aside a potential recovery in mortgage volumes, we see material upside to FICO's guidance as new pricing on mortgage scores is put in place, and believe that the company will hold a substantial portion of its market share relative to VantageScore. FICO has announced three resellers who have joined the Direct License Program (Xactus, Cotality, Ascend Companies), and we believe more may join early in CY26. We believe it is important to note that if more resellers join the DLP, FICO's revenue growth profile for FY26 would likely shift more towards the second half of the year given the lag associated with the funded loan fee; however, we believe that over the long-term this would lead to mortgage revenue being stickier and lowering the risk of attrition to VantageScore. Further, we believe that having more volume on the DLP can help FICO's out-year pricing power as it could tweak either

the mortgage score royalty or funded loan fee to generate more revenue while also keeping its pricing competitive with VS. While investors are not assigning much value to the software business at this time, we believe that elevated bookings from the last 4-5 quarters should translate to accelerating software revenue and ARR throughout FY26.

· Key Debates and Questions: 1) How many of the largest resellers can FICO sign up to the DLP? 2) When will FICO Score 10T be approved for use in scoring government-backed mortgages? 3) How much market share can FICO hold onto in mortgage once VantageScore 4.0 is ready to be implemented? 4) What is out-year runway on pricing for mortgage? · Where we Could be Wrong: We believe there are two areas where we can be wrong on FICO: If the company does not sign up as many resellers to the DLP as expected, investors may become more cautious on its ability to hold market share relative to VantageScore. Announcements around lenders switching for VantageScore for mortgages would also likely lead to downside in the multiple. We believe regulatory risk has likely subsided for now, though FHFA Director announcements could lead to shortterm volatility in shares. Source: Company Documents, Factset, Wolfe Research

· We are Upgrading shares of EXPN-GB to Outperform from Peer Perform. We set a ₤ 42 price target, predicated on 25x our CY27 benchmark EPS estimate of ₤ 1.69 ($2.28 converted at current exchange rates). · Thoughts into 2026 and why we are Upgrading: We are upgrading shares of EXPN-GB to Outperform from Peer Perform. We believe that EXPN has proven that it can compound organic revenue growth in HSD range across a variety of environments, and we believe investors may assign a premium multiple to this stable revenue stream over time. While the company may not benefit as much as peers from a recovery in mortgage volumes given lower exposure as a % of revenue, we are not modeling a material mortgage volume recovery in 2026, and as such believe that EXPN can command a premium multiple vs. the other bureaus. We see the Consumer Services business as being anti-cyclical as it can benefit from increased marketplace activity in times of elevated lending volumes, but also see increased flows towards premium memberships in times of economic stress

as consumers focus more on their credit and spending activity. LATAM growth has underwhelmed in the last year as the Brazilian Central Bank went on a rapid rate hiking cycle; however, benchmark interest rates in Brazil are expected to fall in 2026, which could lead to loosening credit standards. We would expect vertical businesses such as Health and Auto to continue growing at HSD-LDD rates, and we see low-mid teens EPS growth in CY26.

· Key Debates and Questions: 1) Can North America Consumer Services compound growth in the LDD range and how much more runway is there on premium subscriptions? 2) Is guidance on benchmark EBIT margin conservative, and if so, how much upside could there be? 3) When can we see an inflection in the LATAM credit bureau business? 4) How much more market share could EXPN take in its verifications business? · Where we Could be Wrong: If mortgage volumes recovery quicker than expected, TRU and EFX are likely to outperform EXPN given higher exposure to mortgage as a % of revenue. Brazilian elections in the fall of 2026 have the potential to cause elevated macro volatility, which could dampen lending volumes. Source: Company Documents, Factset, Wolfe Research

· Thoughts into 2026: The second half of 2025 proved to be rough for shares of VRSK; however, we are constructive on shares into 2026. While revenue growth may come in below the company's long-term outlook during 1H26 as the company continues to lap elevated claims revenue from last year (plus fewer weather-related events in the last 12 months) and competitive pressures in auto, we believe these dynamics are well understood by investors following the company's 3Q25 earnings print. Subscription OCC revenue continues to grow in-line to slightly better than the company's long-term outlook, which we believe shows that underlying fundamentals for VRSK remain solid, which we believe should help the company return to 6-8% OCC total revenue growth in 2H as the above headwinds normalize. We believe the termination of the AccuLynx acquisition served as a partial clearing event for some who were skeptical on the deal, and we also believe the company's Investor Day in March could serve as a positive catalyst if it reiterates its long-term revenue growth framework.

· Key Debates and Questions: 1) What impact could slowing NWP growth have on OCC revenue growth? 2) What is the company doing to combat competitive headwinds into the auto vertical? 3) What degree of headwind could we see on claims revenue during 1H26? 4) What are updated capital allocation priorities following the termination of the AccuLynx acquisition? · Where we Could be Wrong: If P&C NWP growth decelerates by more than what the industry is expecting, we could see downside to our out-year revenue growth estimates. If competitive pressures in the auto vertical persist beyond 2Q26 or get worse, we could also see downside to our model. While we do not see AI as a material risk to VRSK's business model, we believe headline risk around AI could be a headwind to the multiple if revenue/earnings come in below expectations.

Like others in our coverage universe, 2025 was a tale of two halves for shares of CSGP, with notable 1H outperformance followed by material underperformance in 2H. 3Q25 results were highlighted by underwhelming net new bookings; however, we believe that the overall trendline across the business remains positive and believe 2026 could be a material inflection year for both the company's financials and the stock itself. Within Homes and Apartments, we believe having a full-year of seasoned salespeople could help accelerate the trajectory of net new bookings. For CoStar Suite and LoopNet, we believe that a recovering CRE market should help demand for subscription services in those areas of the business. We also believe we could see near-term catalysts around results from the capital allocation committee meeting in December around Homes.com investment for 2026, breakeven timeline on Homes, and other capital deployment objectives such as a buyback.

· Key Debates and Questions: 1) What level of net new bookings could we see from Homes in 2026? 2) How much will CSGP invest in the Homes platform this year and how long will it take for the segment to breakeven? 3) Does Zillow represent a material competitive threat to Apartments.com? 4) How likely is it that CoStar suite accelerates to double-digit revenue growth in 2026? · Where we Could be Wrong: Within Homes.com, areas where we could be wrong include: 1) sales productivity not ramping as expected and 2) planned investment in Homes for 2026 coming in above both our and buyside expectations. Incremental competitive threats from Zillow could lead to more cautious sentiment on Apartments.com, though we believe there is enough white space for both companies to gain share. Lastly, headwinds in the recovery of the CRE market could limit demand in CoStar and LoopNet. Source: Company Documents, Factset, Wolfe Research

· We see a fair value range for shares of ADP of $250-$310, predicated on ~20-25x our CY27 adjusted EPS estimate of $12.46.

· Thoughts into 2026: With jobs growth having been relatively flat and uncertainty around the trajectory heading into 2026, we remain Peer Perform rated on shares of ADP heading into 2026. We believe that there is downside protection to PPC growth following the company's guide down on F1Q earnings, as ADP has noted that it would take a sustained, material decline in employment throughout the remainder of FY26 for PPC to go ex-growth. We see this dynamic putting the onus on new business bookings to drive growth this year, and management has expressed confidence in its ability to accelerate bookings growth into the 4-7% Y/Y growth range from 3% in FY25. While we believe ADP can continue to gain traction on the bookings front, we believe that muted employment growth could cap upside to estimates over the near-term. We would become more constructive on shares if we see signs of a sustained turnaround in employment.

· Key Debates and Questions: 1) What impact (if any) could AI have on jobs growth and PPC over the medium-long term? 2) What would be the drivers of ES new business bookings growth trending towards the higher end of the company's guidance range? 3) What would drive an acceleration in PEO revenue growth from here? 4) What impact could traction from new platforms (Lyric, WorkforceNow NextGen, Global HCM) have on new business bookings growth?

· Where we Could be Wrong: As we noted above, we believe that PPC guidance is likely protected to the downside as it would take a material and sustained decline in employment for PPC to decline Y/Y in FY26. That said, if employment does begin to inflect positively in CY26, we could see upside to our estimates. Macro uncertainty could have a negative impact on new business bookings growth as we saw in FY25. Lastly, while float income likely has downside protection through Fy27 given the laddering of ADP's investments, any notable changes in interest rates beyond what is being implied by Fed Funds futures could have an impact on out-year float estimates.

· Our YE26 price target of $115 is predicated on 19x our CY27 adjusted EPS estimate of $6.16. · Thoughts into 2026: We remain Underperform rated on shares of PAYX heading into CY26. Shares fell by ~20% in 2025, and we see relative underperformance continuing this year. The F2Q26 print in December gave us confidence that the company could hit its PEO guide (despite concerns that the ramp was too steep heading into earnings); however, given softer organic revenue growth trends within MS through F1H26, we now see implied ramp in MS revenue growth as relatively tough to

achieve. Management pointed towards the low-end of its guidance ranges on earnings, though we remain below total revenue growth guidance for the year (we model 15.9% total revenue growth vs. guidance calling for 16.5-18.5%). We see signs of execution on the revenue synergy from, particularly with cross-selling retirement and ASO to Paycor's customer base, but overall, we continue to see FY26 guidance as a steep hill to climb. Further, given stagnant jobs growth in the U.S., we do not see the potential for upside from employment growth over the near-term.

· Key Debates and Questions: 1) What are the drivers behind the acceleration in MS revenue growth in 2H to hit guidance? 2) How sustainable are the drivers of PEO outperformance from F2Q and what is a sustainable growth level after lapping the MPP headwinds from last year? 3) How sensitive is revenue growth to a slowdown/downturn in employment growth compared to others in the space? 4) What does guidance imply in terms of an exit rate for revenue synergy contribution? · Where we Could be Wrong: Besides employment trending better than expected, we would be wrong in our call for PAYX if MS growth comes in better than what our model is currently implying. We believe this could be driven by better execution on revenue synergies in 2H, improving retention, and execution on new bookings and up-sell/cross-sell with current clients.

· Thoughts into 2026: While declines in base growth have steadily improved in 2025, we believe that the inflection and return to growth from FA's base may have to wait until 2H26, as overall hiring volumes remain muted. FA continues to execute on winning new logos and up-sell/cross-sell, but we believe that base may continue to decline through the first few quarters of 2026, leaving overall revenue growth around 4-5%. We see the potential for the company to grow revenue HSD in the outyears as base eventually returns to growth and the company takes advantage of its market position and emerging growth areas such as identity; however, we believe shares will likely be range-bound until we see the inflection in base. We are constructive on margin expansion as FA realizes the full cost synergy benefits from the Sterling acquisition starting this year, and see the potential for upside to the multiple over the long-term, but believe it may take a few quarters to play out and we remain Peer Perform rated at this time.

· Thoughts into 2025: We remain Peer Perform rated on shares of IT heading into 2026. After recovery slightly from the selloff following the 3Q print, shares have been largely range-bound, and we expect IT to trade in a range for most of 2026. While we recognize that CV growth is likely to accelerate in 2026 as the company laps headwinds from last year associated with DOGE, tariff-impacted industries, and the tech vendor vertical, we believe growth may be capped as uncertainty remains over the broader demand environment. IT saw some customers down-sell in the last year due to macro/budget uncertainty, and while upsell potential is possible in 2026, we believe there is some risk to this notion as customers may be able to operate at a similar level with fewer seat licenses. Downside to the multiple is likely protected at these levels, but believe upside is likely capped until we see evidence of a sustained CV acceleration, which we believe could be more of a 2027 story. We believe Gartner's value proposition remains strong in the long-term

given its proprietary data, analysts, and curated insights, but investors will need to see CV reaccelerate before stepping back in. · Key Debates and Questions: 1) Will renewals continue to drag through 2026 despite a more certain macro outlook? 2) How well will IT be able to upsell 2025 down-sells? 3) Can customers remain efficient with fewer seats but increased AI usage? 4) How has AskGartner resonated with customers and how is it impacting sales? · Where we Could be Wrong: Although we believe it will be difficult to upsell customers who were recently down-sold to budget constraints, Gartner has seen this behavior in the past. At this valuation, shares could rerate higher as upsells contribute to NCVI, recovering from more short-lived budget headwinds than expected. We also recognize LLMs are not nearly a 1-to-1 replacement for Gartner, and customers may be missing Gartner's proprietary insights. Source: Company Documents, Factset, Wolfe Research

We believe that the conclusion of the strategic review can lead to the company returning to trade on fundamentals, but we remain sidelined on shares of CLVT as we await the conclusion and proof of consistent reacceleration in organic revenue growth. We believe we may see another asset disposal, potentially within the healthcare business. Overall, CLVT has demonstrated improved sales execution, business optimization, and accelerated innovation, which we believe may contribute to long-term sustainability. Relative to the rest of our coverage universe, we see modest relative AI risk in A&G, but believe overall risk is likely low given the publications CLVT has in its library of research is not publicly available. Further, a cycle of innovation around AI could also lead to benefits within the company's IP business.

· Key Debates and Questions: 1) What should we expect as a result of the strategic review? 2) Impact from continued execution on value creation plan, and 3) Organic revenue reacceleration timing. · Where we Could be Wrong: Although we remain sidelined, we believe continued execution on VCP and a reacceleration of organic revenue could support shares. We also recognize risk to the upside with a more positive outcome from the strategic review than anticipated.
