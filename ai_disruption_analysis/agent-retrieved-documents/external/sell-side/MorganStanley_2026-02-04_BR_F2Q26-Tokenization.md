| Impact to our thesis | Financial results versus consensus | Direction of next 12-month consensus EPS |

Multiple likely remains somewhat handicapped as investors digest the pace of innovation and durability of the business model in a tokenized equity world Checks suggest DTCC pilot in 2H26 has no impact on the business, w/ on-chain P2P trading without a broker dealer as a low probability (but still tail risk) The multiple could be constrained in the near to medium term due to tokenized equity headlines about on-chain peer-to-peer trading without BD involvement Lower PT to $213 to reflect five-year historical two-year forward median EV / EBITDA multiple of ~15x, which we believe appropriately balances risk reward

Focus will remain on business defensibility in tokenized equity world. Broadridge expects that tokenized equities, regardless of who tokenizes them, will be purchased through a broker dealer and / or trading platform that will still be subject to the same asset-servicing obligations they have today (e.g., proxy, corporate actions, class actions, tax, etc.) while complexity for issuers will rise due to management of registered shares, beneficial shares, and tokenized shares. Our checks suggest that tokenization pilots, including by that of the DTCC, are nascent and unlikely to have an impact on Broadridge given securities will still be held in book entry. However, we believe the multiple could remain constrained until better clarity of what the process for investor outreach for tokenized securities will actually look like.

low-end of EPS outlook raised. BR delivered broad-based F2Q26 results with ICS organic recurring revenue growth of +7% y/y (vs. +4% y/y in F1Q26) and GTO Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

· Position growth: Forward position growth testing-equity position growth in the low-teens with equity revenue position growth in the high-single digits -coupled with outperformance in the quarter underpin management's confidence in being able to deliver on the high-end of the +5-7% y/y recurring revenue growth range for the year. · Widening spread between equity position growth and equity revenue position growth is namely a function of managed accounts. The main delta explaining the spread is managed accounts as the increase in fractional holdings often results in brokers either don't bill issuers at all or bill at a de minimis level that Broadridge doesn't classify as a revenue position. Estimates largely unchanged; lowering PT to $213. We are lowering our price target to $213 (vs. $256 prior) despite limited estimate changes (see

Exhibit 2 ) as we apply a 15x multiple (vs. 18x prior) to our revised Base Case CY27 adjusted EBITDA estimate of $1.860bn. Since last establishing our price target in early November, BR's two-year EV / EBITDA multiple has compressed by ~8% vs. peer multiple compression of ~4% as investors digest the potential impacts of tokenization on its business. Our checks suggest that tokenization pilots, including by that of the DTCC, are nascent and unlikely to have an impact on Broadridge given securities will still be held in book entry. However, we believe the multiple could be somewhat constrained over the near to medium term as headlines and advancements surrounding on-chain peer-to-peer trading (i.e., securities no longer being held in book entry) without a broker dealer, even as we think the probability of that is fairly low. We would note that our target 15x multiple is effectively in line with BR's five-year historical two-year forward EV / EBITDA multiple of ~15.5x, with

incremental multiple expansion likely predicated on investors gaining confidence in business model and fee durability on a terminal basis.

Premium valuation balances market share with event-driven / distribution rev vol

Our Base Case price target assumes mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth and low-20s EBITDA margins through CY27. Our target applies a 15x multiple to our CY27E Base Case EBITDA, reflecting Broadridge's median five-year historical two-year forward EV / EBITDA multiple.

The probabilities of our Bull, Base, and Bear case scenarios playing out were estimated with implied volatility data from the options market as of 3 Feb 2026. All figures are approximate risk-neutral probabilities of the stock reaching beyond the scenario price in either three-months' or one-years' time.

Elevated event-driven / distribution revenue in conjunction with a successful wealth technology platform rollout warrant upperquartile multiple . Assumes sustained high single-digit revenue growth in conjunction with durable low - to mid-20s EBITDA margins could cause investors to assign an upper-quartile multiple. Our multiple represents an approximate 11x premium to other scaled incumbent processors, which we believe would be warranted, should growth accelerate.

Limited competition warrants premium to deal stocks. Assumes mid- to high-singledigit revenue growth and low-20s EBITDA margins through CY27. Our target applies a 15x multiple to our CY27E Base Case EBITDA, in-line with BR's five-year historical two-year forward EV / EBITDA multiple, which we believe appropriately reflects the defensibility of the model.

▪ Broadridge is a global financial technology company providing investor communications, securities processing, data and analytics, and customer communications solutions to banks, broker-dealers, asset and wealth managers and corporate issuers. ▪ In our view, BR's premium valuation appropriately balances the company's dominant market position in proxy related services with event-driven and distribution revenue volatility.

Slower growth incumbent processing multiple. Assumes revenue growth decelerates (driven by fee reductions in proxy services, lower event-driven revenue, normalization in distribution revenue, and / or an unsuccessful wealth technology platform rollout) and margin expansion is more muted than management expects. Multiple is below trough levels over the last five years. M

Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, M Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold and sell. Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone. In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice. An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations.

Overweight (O). The stock's total return is expected to exceed the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Equal-weight (E). The stock's total return is expected to be in line with the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Not-Rated (NR). Currently the analyst does not have adequate conviction about the stock's total return relative to the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Underweight (U). The stock's total return is expected to be below the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months.

Unless otherwise specified, the time frame for price targets included in Morgan Stanley Research is 12 to 18 months.

Attractive (A): The analyst expects the performance of his or her industry coverage universe over the next 12-18 months to be attractive vs. the relevant broad market benchmark, as indicated below. In-Line (I): The analyst expects the performance of his or her industry coverage universe over the next 12-18 months to be in line with the relevant broad market benchmark, as indicated below. Cautious (C): The analyst views the performance of his or her industry coverage universe over the next 12-18 months with caution vs. the relevant broad market benchmark, as indicated below. Benchmarks for each region are as follows: North America - S&P 500; Latin America - relevant MSCI country index or MSCI Latin America Index; Europe - MSCI Europe; Japan - TOPIX; Asia relevant MSCI country index or MSCI sub-regional index or MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex Japan Index.
