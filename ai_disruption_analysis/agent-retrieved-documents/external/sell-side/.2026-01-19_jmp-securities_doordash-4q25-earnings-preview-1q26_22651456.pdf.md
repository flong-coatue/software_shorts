DoorDash 4Q25 Earnings Preview: 1Q26 EBITDA Guidance a Risk but Top Line Should be Healthy

· For DoorDash's 4Q25 earnings, we expect GOV to come in ahead of consensus and the high end of guidance but expect 1Q26 EBITDA guidance to bracket consensus expectations given 2026 is an investment year with a significant step up in R&D investments. While we lower our 1Q26 EBITDA estimate with this note as we now factor in more expenses, we raise our 2027 EBITDA as we have growing conviction in the sustainability of DoorDash's GOV growth, while our checks on DoorDash's ad load and grocery UX both

show ongoing improvements. With DoorDash focusing on growing Deliveroo abroad, our big picture point is that DoorDash today has more levers to sustain growth than at any point in the company's history, while we expect unit economics to continue to improve across the business. To be clear, 2026 is an investment year, but we believe this positions the company well to continue to take share as we view DoorDash as a 'core holding' for internet investors given its immense TAM, long-term oriented leadership that drives consistently solid execution, and significant moat around its U.S. restaurant marketplace that is helping it extend to other categories. While we are somewhat cautious on the quarter, and are just in line with consensus for 1Q26 EBITDA, we continue to be buyers and maintain our Market Outperform rating and unchanged $285 price target.

· Expect 1Q26 OpEx to step up high-single-digits Q/Q, which puts our 1Q26 EBITDA estimate in line with consensus. OpEx from 4Q to 1Q grew 9.5% in 1Q23, 13.1% in 1Q24, and 8.6% in 1Q25, and consensus expects 4.9% OpEx growth in 1Q26. Given Deliveroo closed on October 2, 1Q25, Q/Q expense growth is 99% organic, but we worry that higher dasher costs, hiring, and the annual reset of payroll taxes are not appropriately factored into 1Q26 EBITDA expectations, and an EBITDA beat looks unlikely to us. To be clear, we anticipate higher top line for next year, and we believe flow-through from better top-line results can lead to an ~in line with consensus 1Q26 EBITDA guide but we think there is likely more downside risk than upside for 1Q26 EBITDA guidance given this is an investment year.

· DoorDash's ad load continues to increase. In our tracking of ad load, we are seeing significant growth in ad load for DoorDash grocery. This bodes well for new vertical unit economics as we believe DoorDash continues to improve density, picking accuracy, and promotional intensity as the category matures. · DoorDash's grocery UX features are becoming more robust. In our 'ghost shopping' of DoorDash, we are now seeing more robust filtering and search features, including ripeness preferences for fruit. DoorDash also added more nutrition information and product attributes for CPG product pages as it continues to improve the grocery shopping experience. · DoorDash last closed at $205.32, which implies it trades for 21.2x our 2027E EBITDA of $4.6B (3.0% of GOV). Our price target of $285 is based on ~30x 2027E EBITDA, a premium to comps that we justify given our view that DoorDash is under-earning today.

January 19, 2026

Price: $205.32 Price Target: $285.00

We expect DoorDash to report better-than-expected 4Q25 results as we believe cohorts continue to support persistent growth for DoorDash and Wolt's restaurant GOV, while the addition of Deliveroo to GOV

is additive as third-party data suggest improving engagement. While we expect GOV to come in above guidance and consensus, we note DoorDash already declared 2026 an investment year; we worry 1Q26 EBITDA guidance will bracket consensus and our updated estimate is now ~in line with consensus. That said, we continue to be buyers, especially on any dip, as new products ramp and contribute to growth, while we expect unit economics for new verticals to continue to improve. Given DoorDash's large TAM, historically strong execution, and bestin-class management, we continue to view DoorDash as a 'core holding' for internet investors and we maintain our Market Outperform rating and $285 despite our slightly cautious stance on 1Q26 guidance as our price target looks out 12 months.

DoorDash is scheduled to 4Q25 report earnings on February 18, 2026 at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET after the market close. Key topics to watch for 1Q26 earnings:  Continued momentum for U.S. restaurant demand. In 3Q25, U.S. restaurant marketplace GOV accelerated and reached the highest Y/Y growth in more than three years. Explaining this, we believe cohorts remain stable, while DoorDash added more U.S. members in the first nine months of 2025 than in all of 2024, and we believe new verticals are acting as an onramp for customers, who then also order from restaurants. The importance of U.S. restaurant GOV is that U.S. restaurant incremental margins are above 7% (at least as of last quarter), making U.S. restaurant growth a key driver of EBITDA (we estimate EBITDA is 2.7% of 2025 GOV).

 Incremental investments likely to drive growth in Deliveroo. DoorDash is most focused on customer retention and order frequency to be able to build sustainable cohorts that grow over time. To that end, we will be listening for details on changes to Deliveroo's operations and for any early impact to key inputs, including retention and order frequency for Deliveroo.

 New vertical contribution and improvement to unit economics. Last quarter, DoorDash highlighted new vertical MAU improved Q/Q and Y/Y, frequency increased, and AOV grew as new vertical categories accelerated Y/Y. With greater scale, new verticals unit economics improved Y/Y and Q/Q, while DoorDash also reduced consumer transaction fees. While we expect unit economics to have remained negative in 4Q25, we are focused on continued progress in scaling order density, improving operations to reduce contra-revenue items, and ultimately, the path to turning new vertical unit economics positive.

 Contribution from DoorDash's advertising business. In 3Q25, DoorDash highlighted that advertising on its marketplace was supply constrained as advertiser demand outpaced the amount of inventory capacity for ads on DoorDash's platform. We expect momentum in ad demand to have continued as DoorDash has developed multiple CPG ad tools in the last year, including auto-bidding for Sponsored Products in summer 2025, catalog manager improvements and measurement for incrementality announced in October, and new analytics that measures advertiser share in November 2025, as well as new self-serve dashboards in early 2026. While we do not expect a new disclosure on ads from DoorDash, we believe momentum continued in 4Q25, which is a tailwind for profitability.

 EBITDA will be an output of DoorDash's investment intensity across its growing categories of products. With DoorDash increasing its intensity in platform investments, including unifying tech stacks across its brands and readying the platform for greater use of AI, while autonomous vehicles are also a significant investment, DoorDash is stepping up its fixed costs in 2026. However, the company is also driving more growth as geographic coverage now includes 40+ countries, its software offering is more comprehensive following the acquisition of SevenRooms, and new verticals, specifically grocery, ramp while unit economics improve across DoorDash's platform. However, DoorDash's new investments likely outweigh incremental contribution margin as we expect 2026 EBITDA as a percentage of GOV to be flat Y/Y.

We expect a step-up in investments in 2026 as we revise our 1Q26 EBITDA estimate down. Specifically, we incorporate higher estimates across DoorDashs' operating expense base and cost of revenue, with key cost drivers of technology investments and the acquisition of Deliveroo, which we note closed on October 2, making 4Q25 the first full quarter with Deliveroo results.

To better assess DoorDash's seasonality and Q/Q fluctuations from 4Q25 to 1Q26, we analyzed DoorDash's 4Qto-1Q Q/Q performance from over the past six year. Specifically, 1Q cost headwinds include higher dasher costs due to winter weather, seasonal hiring, and annually reset payroll taxes. To that end, we raise our 1Q26 estimates to reflect higher investments in cost of revenue, driven by increased employee-related expenses and duplicative cloud costs, while we expect R&D spend to remain elevated in 1Q26 given spend toward engineering talent as DoorDash re-platforms its tech stack, builds AI infrastructure, and invests in autonomous vehicle development. This as we believe DoorDash is reinvesting more in Deliveroo than we previously anticipated as its merger target of a 1-3% global workforce reduction (including headcount from DoorDash, Wolt, and Deliveroo) is likely pushed toward the

back-half of the year, and offset by Deliveroo's growth initiatives. Despite the 1Q26 step-up in expenses, we expect contribution margins to improve through the year. Specifically, despite our projection that 2H26 OpEx is ~$140M higher than 1Q26, we expect contribution margins to scale as growth continues, unit economics improve, and Deliveroo's growth initiatives gain traction. While DoorDash's prioritization of growth is a persistent company strategy, we view 2026's platform and Deliveroo investments as more one-time in nature as we project EBITDA growth to accelerate in 2027 as incremental costs normalize.

DoorDash has accelerated hiring, particularly for engineering roles. This as job postings for engineering positions have risen to ~100, compared to 85 at the start of the year (+18%). DoorDash Labs has also expanded its hiring, with postings increasing to 28 from 16 (+75%), reflecting a focus on high-paying roles in robotics, autonomous driving, and drone delivery. Additionally, outside sales have grown from 25 to 34 postings (+36%), while new verticals have increased from 10 to 17 (+70%) since the beginning of the year (Figure 5). This as DoorDash's recent hiring trends across engineering, outside sales, DoorDash Labs, and new verticals have increased 26% since January 2025, outpacing total hiring growth of ~15%, highlighting DoorDash's commitment to invest in innovation and new business lines in 2026.

Autonomy is a significant initiative in 2026, based on hiring data . Specifically, DoorDash is hiring for roles including Operations Manager for Remote Assistance within DoorDash Labs, Operations Specialists for training facilities in Mexico City, and Robot Operations Specialists based in Phoenix, Arizona, signaling DoorDash's clear intent to scale and operationalize autonomous delivery capabilities more broadly in the coming year. That said, this remains a long-term initiative and it is still in its early stages. Autonomous delivery requires getting multiple components right, including manufacturing, partnerships, hardware and software integration, repair and teleoperations, and coordination with city governments, as we have seen with Waymo.

Sensor Tower app usage data for 4Q25 suggest growth slowed for core DoorDash. This as DoorDash DAU growth moderated to +13.4% Y/Y, down from +19.2% Y/Y in 3Q25, reflecting tougher comps and normalization after a strong 2025. In contrast, Deliveroo outperformed, accelerating sequentially, with DAU up +4.5% Y/Y. This compares to outperformance in Wolt, which also stepped-up in 4Q25, with growth improving to +14.2% Y/Y, up from +10.2% Y/Y in 3Q25, as DoorDash appears to be gaining momentum internationally.

Our tracking of CPG advertisements across DoorDash, Uber (MP), and Instacart's (CART, MO, $60 PT) grocery platforms suggests DoorDash and Uber are making progress in terms of expanding ad load . Our tracking suggests that ad load across product/category and brand searches for DoorDash and Uber have increased since last year, while product ad load for Instacart decreased and brand searches have increased since last year.

Stepping back, we tracked grocery sponsored listings across the first ten results in New York City, Boston, and San Francisco for DoorDash, Instacart, and Uber. We found that on Instacart, sponsored listings were present on an average of 6.1 placements out of the first 10 product listings per category (down from 6.5 last year and 7.2 in September 2024), while for brand searches, sponsored listings were present on an average of 6.1 product listings compared to 4.9 last year of the first 10 products listed (but in line with ~6.1 product listings in September 2024). This compares to 3.7 listings, on average, with a sponsored product for DoorDash, which compares to 2.3 last year, and 0.6 for product/category search sponsored listings in September 2024. For Uber, branded searches were ~2.2 of sponsored listings, which compares to ~0.6 last year and 1.8 in September 2024.

Interestingly, DoorDash and Uber are seeing higher ad load for product/category search, while Uber is seeing higher ad load in branded search compared to DoorDash versus the prior year. That being said, we acknowledge the limited dataset of our three-person team, while January seasonality may explain the difference.

Product / Category Search Source: Citizens JMP Securities, LLC The expansion of promotions into the search bar, further highlights DoorDash's increased ad load. We note when searching for 'burger' within the search bar, we are now getting merchant funded offers from restaurants. To that end, we believe DoorDash's advertising offering is beginning to mature as DoorDash is actively expanding its advertising formats to better match peers.

DoorDash now shows real-time inventory counts for individual items. We believe this reflects deeper integration of DashMarts into DoorDash's broader technology platform as it continues to improve. This also highlights the complexity of DashMart assortment management, given the significant breadth of SKUs carried. For example, a simple search for 'bread' can surface 500 related items, emphasizing the scale of product variation and the depth of DoorDash's catalog.

To that end, as DoorDash scales its merchant catalog, we believe it benefits from advertising monetization as a larger SKU base enables more granular ad placements and broader relevance across categories. Further, we note product pages now increasingly include richer item -level details, such as nutritional information, ingredient lists, allergen warnings, and product attributes, such as kosher, organic, or non -GMO. To that end, we believe DoorDash is likely using AI -generated or AI -enhanced imagery and metadata to unlock more descriptive, standardized product information at scale.

DoorDash continues to enhance the grocery experience as we note for produce, such as avocados or bananas, users can now select a preferred ripeness level, which improves the accuracy and satisfaction of fresh -food orders. In addition, DoorDash has introduced a new 'Direct to You' delivery option, which offers faster grocery delivery for an additional $3.99. This is a feature we had not previously observed within the grocery experience, which we believe reflects a clear push toward premium fulfillment tiers. We expect DoorDash to continue adding functionality over time, especially as we look toward Instacart's robust checkout experience, which includes features such as Schedule & Save, deliver tomorrow, and fast -delivery. While these enhancements are minor, we believe this is suggestive that competitive dynamics in grocery fulfillment will expand beyond assortment and pricing into speed, customization, order accuracy, and user -level convenience.

We analyzed a random sample of cash-back promotions on DoorDash to determine whether restaurants are SevenRooms clients. Among the 20 restaurants surveyed, three were not SevenRooms clients, they were using OpenTable and Resy instead. Notably, these three restaurants were flagged as 'newly added,' suggesting they may have recently transitioned to SevenRooms. Stepping back, in June 2025, DoorDash acquired both SevenRooms (which offers Waitlist and CRM software) and Symbiosys (ad-tech that focuses on allocating retail media spend). With Storefront, DoorDash's website offering, now supporting 100K+ merchants, DoorDash is now creating a full-stack, front-of-house offering that we believe can effectively compete with RESY or OpenTable for table management and demand generation for in-restaurant dining.

While it is still early in DoorDash training users to look to DoorDash for in-person dining, DoorDash has the foundational elements with traffic to its core app, demand generation/marketing solutions (for delivery and now in-restaurant), and software to manage tables, reservations, and waitlists for front-of-house staff. This as our job tracking found that DoorDash is investing in hiring Account Executives in Sydney, expanding Revenue Operations roles in London, and adding new engineering positions for SevenRooms, though this is a small investment relative to its other major investment areas of 2026.

Source: Company app and website, Citizens JMP Securities, LLC Given DoorDash's growth focus, we note the next obvious area of expansion is payments. We believe payments is the largest TAM available for DoorDash's software offerings, while we think tighter integration between a restaurant's core payment platform and third-party food delivery platform can help to reconcile billing more accurately for merchants, while connecting the diner profiles of in-restaurant customers to those ordering off-platform. That said, we would not expect DoorDash to share this information with restaurants.

Highlighting this opportunity, Toast (TOST, NC) partnered with Uber Eats in November 2025 to focus on product innovation and go-to-market initiatives, while also making Uber Toast's preferred food delivery marketplace, which was previously DoorDash. While we do not view this change as foreshadowing DoorDash directly competing with Toast, we note DoorDash's 2022 acquisition, Bbot, filed patents for a POS system as its core technology facilitated in-store digital ordering, while reports have discussed DoorDash testing a POS.

DoorDash is the largest food ordering platform in the U.S., and is a three-sided marketplace connecting restaurants, diners, and Dashers. The platform is a merchant-first business providing opportunities for brick-and-mortar restaurants to expand their reach, to address consumers' expectations of ease and immediacy, and to thrive in today's convenience economy. DoorDash was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California. Across DoorDash's business, we are most focused on orders, AOV trends, and marketplace GOV. We believe these three metrics ultimately drive revenue and profitability.

Food delivery remains a highly competitive market. Future regulatory risks around rate caps and/or gig-economy drivers may impact growth. Demand for food delivery has been accelerated by COVID-19, this may change post-pandemic. DoorDash is investing heavily in growth, and long-term margin expansion is dependent on this.
