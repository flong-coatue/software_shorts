CHRW - Share Gains + Margin Discipline Validate the $6 EPS Framework We are maintaining our 2026E EPS, while raising our PT to $210 (from $190). CHRW continues to execute through a weak freight environment, delivering its 11th consecutive quarter of share gains while expanding margins in NAST despite late-quarter spot rate pressure. Productivity gains, pricing discipline, and a structurally lower cost-to-serve underpin confidence in the $6 EPS framework, which assumes no market recovery. While Global Forwarding remains cyclical and 1Q26 seasonally softer, we see CHRW exiting the downturn structurally stronger, with clear upside leverage as volumes normalize.

The Quarter CHRW reported 4Q25 results incl. adj. EPS of $1.23 on revenue of $3.91B (vs. our $1.13/$4.06B estimates, and the Street's $1.12/$3.99B). From a topline perspective, NAST came in below our expectations at $2.81B (-4.5% vs. our model), while Global Forwarding came in below at $731mm (-1.9% our model) and Sourcing was above our expectations at $341mm (+15% our model). That said, NAST performance was still strong as volumes increased ~1% YoY and Truckload volume rose ~3% YoY, outperforming the Cass Freight Shipment Index decline of 7.6% - marking its 11th consecutive quarter

of share gains. On the cost front, EBIT was lower than expected at $181.4mm (-3.3% vs. our model), while Operating Ratio (OR) improved ~20bps YoY to 95.4% driven by lower Purchased Transportation and Related Services (-80bps vs. our model as a % of sales). On an annual basis adj. EBIT margin increased ~490 bps YoY to 29.1%. Importantly, despite a sharp truckload spot rate spike late in the quarter, CHRW held truckload Average Gross Profit (AGP) per mile flat YoY and expanded NAST operating margin by 150bps to 34.3%, reflecting improved cost-of-hire discipline and dynamic pricing tools.

2026 Commentary - In the call, management characterized 1Q26 as seasonally weaker, given that spot cost pressure from December carried into January and that ocean rate normalization is expected to persist into early 2026. That said, management reaffirmed high confidence in its ~$6 EPS target, which notably assumes no market growth, underscoring earnings durability from productivity, margin discipline, and cost leverage. Lean AI commentary focused less on aspiration and more on process change: automation is

Final Thoughts In our view, the quarter and call commentary reinforced to us that CHRW is exiting the freight downturn structurally stronger, with consistent share gains, expanding margins in its core brokerage business, and growing operating leverage. While Global Forwarding remains cyclical, margin discipline and cost progress are tangible. We view CHRW as well positioned to deliver durable earnings through the cycle, with meaningful upside leverage when freight demand eventually inflects. We maintain our 2026E EPS of $6.00 and initiate a 2027 estimate of $7.20, while raising our PT to $210 (from $190).

Eden Prairie, MN based C.H. Robinson (CHRW) is a leading global logistics company, providing freight transportation, logistics, outsourcing solutions, produce sourcing and information services. In 2025 the company generated ~$16B in revenue by managing >$20B worth of freight while serving >80,000 customers worldwide across a multitude of industry sectors. The company's services are possible thanks to a network of >450,000 transportation providers (motor carriers, railroads, air, and ocean).

We have a Buy rating on CHRW shares. In our view, CHRW is taking the right steps with regard to (1) re-capturing market share growth geared towards margin-accretive segments, as well as (2) investing in technology to improve efficiency and further bolster its margin profile. With that in mind, we also believe there is significant room for upside to current estimates, if the company is able to return its margin profile to levels witnessed back in 2015-2016.

Our $210 price target is based on 35x our 2026E adj. EPS. This compares to the company's 16-28x historical trading average as well as the industry's 16-28x historical average. In our view, the company warrants a valuation above the high end of its historical multiple given our expectation around the company's potential for (1) market share growth and (2) continued operating margin expansion.

Global Macro-Economic Exposure CHRW operates in an environment where it has exposure to all of the different global geographies. Any risk of an economic recession, changes in trade policies, and tariffs could impact CHRW's ability to generate revenue and operate efficiently across virtually any end market. Supply Chain Risk Any hiccups to the domestic and global supply chain could lead to significant impacts to CHRW's ability to operate efficiently. Environment Regulations & Government Regulations CHRW's operations are highly dependent on the use of other carrier's ground, air and ocean vehicles. Any change across the world around vehicle regulations could have a potential negative impact on CHRW's ability to operate. Climate/Weather Challenges Any climate related issues across different geographic regions could impact the company's ability to move goods, thus causing delays in its operations and potential delays in revenue generation. Cybersecurity Risk/IT Risk - Any potential hack's to the company's systems could lead to operational challenges and increased financial/ litigation costs.

Strategy Risk CHRW has recently announced the divestiture of its European Surface Transportation business. If the company's strategy does not work as the company anticipates longer term, it would have a negative impact on the company's revenue, operations and profitability. Foreign Exchange Risk CHRW derives a portion of its revenue from currencies that are not the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar were to appreciate vs. such currencies it could have an impact on the company's reported revenue, profitability and cash flow performance. M&A Risk CHRW has historically acquired other business and/or operations from other companies. As such, if CHRW were to have challenges integrating such businesses it could lead to operational and/or financial challenges for the company. Inflation Risk Elevated inflation has the potential to impact consumer and business demand for goods and services, which could consequently impact macro conditions and the need for CHRW's services.
