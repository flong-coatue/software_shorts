Mark L. Moerdler, Ph.D. +1 917 344 8506 mark.moerdler@bernsteinsg.com Firoz Valliji, CFA +1 917 344 8316 firoz.valliji@bernsteinsg.com Shelly Tang, CFA +1 917 344 8342 shelly.tang@bernsteinsg.com It is the beginning of 2026 and the world in general and software more specifically is quite different from what we saw in early 2025. Investor focus has shifted dramatically from macro concerns to the disruptive rise of AI, amplified by significant headline noise and bold claims from experts. Two key questions dominate investor discussions: 1) Are we in an AI bubble? and 2) Is AI going to eat enterprise software? In today's note, we outline: 1) our views on the current state of AI and what we expect for 2026 and beyond, 2) the key themes shaping our outlook for the software sector and our coverage, and 3) which stocks we would own versus avoid-and why.

To help set CY26 in perspective we look back, at a high level, at software and Cloud and how 1 st the Cloud transition, then the pandemic, and more recently the Gen AI hype cycle impacts both growth and valuations across software / Cloud. We think that CY26 is beginning with a rare opportunity for investors to pick high-quality software stocks at deep discounts. Despite noise and uncertainty around AI, we are seeing early signs of 'sanity', as discussions with investors are shifting toward companyspecific opportunities. As the situation stands today, the macro environment is stable if not improving. Encouragingly, our most recent CIO surveys show one of the strongest IT spending outlooks since 2018. Improving macro, lower interest rates and pro-economy policy ahead of the US midterm elections could further support demand-especially among SMBs, which often recover faster than enterprises.

As to our coverage, we would buy Oracle, Microsoft, SAP and HUBS today. We would capitalize any buying opportunity on MDB. We recommend investors do more work on Workday, and Adobe, and 1) build confidence and 2) find the right entry point where appropriate. We would stay on the sidelines with Snowflake, and we are very concerned that Salesforce will continue to Underperform.

Software companies exposed to SMB could see earlier re-acceleration in revenue in CY26 than enterprise as the impact of the macro decreases (e.g. US economic stability, deregulation and tax cuts in the US, no new tariffs). Gen AI will become more real in CY26 but for SaaS solution only a few will generate meaningful revenue while Gen AI apps developed internally by enterprises will start to gain more traction in CY27 and beyond. We would own Oracle, Microsoft, SAP and HubSpot (all rated Outperform) for the attractive risk-reward trade off discussed below. We also like the combination of long-term value and near-term momentum with MDB (rated Outperform). We would recommend investors do more work on Workday, and Adobe (both rated Outperform) and find the right entry point where appropriate. We would stay on the sidelines with Snowflake (rated Market-Perform), and we are very concerned that Salesforce will Underperform.

We start each year off with an outlook note discussing our expectations for the upcoming 12 months for software in general and for our coverage more specifically. Today's note looks back at 2025 and looks forward to CY26 with an eye not only to the key themes but also company-specific factors which will likely impact our coverage during CY26. We hope you find this note helpful and look forward to working together during 2026.

2026 starts off as a very unusual year for software and very different from how 2025 started. We started 2025 seeing two key themes : 1) Macro including the impact of the new US government; and 2) the early days of enterprise use of Gen AI. We start out 2026 in a very different place. Macro impacts and concerns have not gone away they simply have been eclipsed in most investor's minds by AI. We sit in a moment in time where the sheer volume of conflicting news flows and big statements by 'experts' is driving the stocks in a way we have not seen in a very long time. Most investors have two main concerns: · Are we in an AI bubble? · Is AI going to eat enterprise software?

The vast majority of our client conversations, especially late last year (CY25) started with one of these questions and then moved to the other question. As we will discuss below, this focus on AI combined with the divergent /conflicting concerns shows, we believe, the lack of clarity on the impact of AI on software which can create, as we saw, major moves in stocks driven by news (and sometimes incorrect news) rather than fundamentals. While the noise is still extremely high we are starting to see the very early signs of clarity with the people on the ground in the AI developer / innovator ecosystem, and we hope that will transfer to the investor community by mid 26. In fact, the calls we started to receive in late CY25 and so far this year have been more focused on companies and investment opportunities which leads us to believe that the investor community is starting to get a handle on the near-term impact of Gen AI, even if the long term impact is still cloudy (more in a moment). Or maybe valuations have dropped to where the reward is greater than the risk especially over the next 1+ years.

On the positive side of the equation - initial signs are that IT spending expectations are good in our November IT spending growth expectations entering 2026, based on our recent CIO survey the 2nd strongest read since our Nov. 2018 survey. CIOs, we believe, have become, over the past 3 months, incrementally positive on their outlook for H1'26 and full year 2026. With some incremental budget for AI and more rational expectations, we believe, from CIOs on what can be accomplished with AI in CY26 the setup could be better than investors are expecting, at least for the 2 nd half of CY26 when the compares get easier and in some specific cases in H1.

Before going into the companies, we want to touch on the key themes more specifically:

Valuation on most software stocks have halved over the last six months, despite most of these companies delivering healthy results. With some stocks trading at historically low valuation we think it is a great opportunity to scoop up high-quality companies and this may in fact be the reason we are having more company specific calls, especially on quality companies trading at meaningfully depressed valuations (e.g. Adobe). In fact, we think that the upcoming CY26/FY27 guidance announcements across a large portion of software could be a clearing event for the sector.

Generative AI has become the biggest driver of software stock sentiment and is a substantial portion of our client interaction especially over the last few months. We will start by laying out how we think about software and Gen AI.

· While Gen AI is driving the conversation it is not driving the results for most software stocks and especially our coverage . · The big Gen AI discrepancy across the tech stack : Last year we held a webinar on whether we were in an AI bubble that included 5 Bernstein tech analysts: Stacy Rasgon (US Semiconductors), Mark Newmark (US IT Hardware), Mark Shmulik (US Internet), Peter Weed (US SMID-CAP software and cybersecurity) and myself (Mark Moerdler - Global Software) and the difference in perspective between the bottom of the tech stack (semis and hardware) vs. software was surprising. The reason, we believe, sheds light on what is going on in software stocks entering 2026: Tech and frontier model companies are spending vast sums of money for AI hardware predominantly to train models, but there is very little revenue at the top of the stack: software. This leads to :

1. Concern that all the CAPEX spent on training / inferencing datacenters will not generate sustainable / quality revenue which overhangs Microsoft and Oracle within our coverage. 2. If Gen AI is real, but you don't see revenue at a specific software company then it must be that the software incumbents are being disintermediated by startups or the technology itself - in other words AI eats enterprise software which you see most visibly at Adobe. · AI does not eat enterprise software: Enterprises are not going to develop their own apps to replace important enterprise apps using Gen AI tools (at least during any reasonable investment horizon) and startups are more likely to disrupt around the edges than replace modern SaaS apps in any meaningful numbers. · The AI model wars : There is a lot of confusion, we believe, in perceptions and expectations on models and especially the frontier models. Our current opinion is:

· Currently, we are seeing, we believe, the 'winner-takes-all' mindset especially amongst investors in which one model will be dominant in technologically, usage, and revenue - this rarely occurs in software and given the current rate of innovation and competition is unlikely, we believe, to happen with frontier models. · There will not be, we believe, a single frontier model created in the foreseeable future that is significantly ahead of its competitors and thus owns the market. In fact, we would argue that multiple times during CY26 we will see a different 'leading' model. Today Gemini 1 is perceived as the leader, but that is likely going to change. In fact, we would argue that there will be multiple leading frontier models each leading in a specific set of use cases but none dominant broadly.

· While news organizations and investors are focused on which is the best frontier model for enterprises, most enterprise app vendors are using numerous smaller / specialized models in their AI apps. We are still seeing a mixture amongst enterprises, but we expect that the use of small / specialized models will increase as IT gains a better understanding and tools help engineers in selecting the 'right' model (Adobe is already doing this in their Foundry offering) · Enterprise AI adoption : CY26 will still be more of an earlier adopter time than the big Gen AI year. We expect to see more Gen AI functionality and applications (and apps that are defined as Gen AI when in fact they have little or no Gen AI or even AI) but pure revenue generation will still be relatively small, and for most companies their 'AI revenue' or 'AI ARR' will continue to grow, but we will likely only see a couple of cases across our coverage where investors can see a positive impact of AI on total revenue. This is due to many factors impacting the customer, the vendor, and the technology.

· The fact that some software vendors are touting big AI numbers 2 , but growth has not changed is causing some of the negativity across software. · For any software company reading this: you may be doing your company and your investors a dis-service by simply calling out the numbers without a lot more context. Investors will be concerned that the AI revenue is being generated at the expense of core revenue, so please be careful how you frame this. Of course, driving usage is key as it could turn into real revenue, but please don't misstate how much customers are really incrementally paying or investors will expect AI driven acceleration to early.

· This does not mean we are not seeing AI tailwinds, but most of those tailwinds are at 1) startups who have no other revenue streams; 2) at hyperscalers (Microsoft and Oracle in our coverage); and possibly in CY26 at a couple of our covered companies, likely in late CY26. By CY27 AI should be a real business for many enterprise software companies and then the question will be: ' is it additive or does it replace traditional products and revenue ' - but this can only be answered on a company by company and product by product basis. · Gen AI will be a tailwind for some software / Cloud companies but not for most. In our CY25 initial outlook we wrote that Gen AI would be a tailwind for some software / Cloud and while Microsoft saw the tailwind for Azure the rest of software did not deliver visible tailwinds from AI. We were also a bit too optimistic that we expect a lot more in CY26. We continue to expect a tailwind, but it will be limited in CY26 but even then there will be many for which their Gen AI offerings are not

1 Gemini is owned by Google which is covered by the US Internet team. 2 Adobe and others are calling out how much of revenue is being impacted by AI which is incrementally better but still begs the question of when / how much AI will drive new revenue and how much AI could impact margins. differentiated enough to drive meaningful revenue, and for some it will be a headwind either because it decreases seats without driving offsetting consumption or because the competitors take share or simply because IT is focused elsewhere and growth slows.

· Enterprise built Gen AI is going to take more time to be a visible spending driver. Last year we said we expected enterprise adoption would start to be visible in CY26 / 27, and while we continue to believe some very large IT centric organizations will deliver internally built real AI capabilities we believe that the visible IT internally built AI will have to wait till CY27 / CY28 for most companies as there is still a lot of work required to clean up organizational data estates; understand what problems are best solved with Gen AI; and implement the required data privacy and security systems. What is interesting is that we saw similar expectations in our recent CIO survey with IT focused on packaged AI solutions delivered predominantly from existing software companies.

· Agentic AI is still very early days and while expectations continue to be high (and long-term this is the right expectation) it is going to take more time. There is a lot of fundamental research and development ahead for complex agentic platforms to be usable by more than bleeding edge development organizations. Small / specialized agents that are developed by software vendors and some IT organizations that deliver more simplistic workflows using off-the-shelf tools, where the data is very well curated and the operations performed are limited in number and scope can be built today but the revenue tailwind that some hope for in enterprise platforms and app vendors could start in CY27 but more likely in CY28.

Macro was very impactful last year, as we had forecasted in our CY25 Initial Thoughts, and it caused spending delays rather than a hit to spending. This year we expect that macro will continue to have a meaningful effect on the numbers but not that much on investor sentiment. But frankly this is a guess, and we are not more knowledgeable than our readers nor do we have a crystal ball. The world is more turbulent than we saw pre-COVID and more interconnected. That said we believe that the biggest impacts to software results from the change in administration will be:

· CY26 IT spending will look like CY25 as we start the year, but it could get better mid-year . 2026 IT budgets, based on our recent survey would seem to be similar to CY25 with a real possibility it could be incrementally better. The tariffs are in the numbers and there is a tax rebate coming to US taxpayers. While the administration is also focused globally we expect a meaningful focus on the US economy to impact the mid-term elections. · SMB spending will likely lead enterprise spending . SMB is the canary in the coal mine for economic changes, and with the US govt focused on decreasing regulation, lower taxes and improving the economy we could see SMB rebound quicker than enterprise - which would mean that SMB centric software / Cloud could see a tailwind before enterprise centric vendors.

· While we have just discussed how SMB is likely faster to see any benefits from an improving economy, two of our top picks (Oracle and SAP) have very little exposure to SMB - the reason is that our thesis for both companies is not tied to an improving economy but rather the unique opportunities they have exposure to (more on this later in the note). One of our top picks is all about SMB - and that is HubSpot, while our other top pick, Microsoft, has a fairly medium SMB exposure, but we are not yet giving them any credit for an improvement on that side of the business, but it could be upside. · Decreasing the US regulatory overhead has been a focus of this administration, but we have heard very little about this recently so while it may not get better it is unlikely to get worse.

· Deglobalization is happening as we speak. As we discussed last year ( Link ) we are seeing increased focus in many parts of the world for local technology industries especially in IaaS/PaaS and AI is only increasing that focus by many governments. With AI still having a small impact on software revenues, other than at Microsoft and shortly Oracle, localized investment in AI models and apps could have nominal CY26 impact. Even the focus on building local IaaS/PaaS is likely to have little effect in CY26 other than as a possible tailwind for Oracle Alloy and Oracle OCI Gen 2 sovereign regions. · Global conflicts have not gone away and the US government is working to try to forge stability in the Middle East the recent regime change in Venezuala could portent more targeted actions by the US government. The wild cards are going to be the war in the Middle East and Ukraine, but anything is possible.

As valuation for the software sector has reset over the last year and continues to be below historical levels - Our top-picks are the ones that have dislocated valuation (Exhibit 4, Exhibit 2), that is not justified by business fundamentals.

· Microsoft (Key takeaways note, Azure AI post 2030, Azure AI margins): We see Microsoft as one the most durable software business with 1) multiple growth levers, 2) very healthy profitability, 3) a disciplined management, and 4) a reset valuation (down 20% since Oct '25). We think this is a great entry point to accumulate a high-quality compounder. It is one of the few tech vendors with full-stack AI offering that they can monetize across its enterprise installed base. · Last year we discussed how Microsoft would be a winner in Gen AI and that CAPEX concerns would dissipate as CAPEX growth slows, and AI revenue will accelerate Azure revenue. We in fact wrote all about this (Link to Note) and management delivered. But while the stock is up ~14% from Jan 1,2025, it is below its peaks and investor sentiment is a bit more mixed and the stock is less crowded last we checked. The reasons are two-fold: 1) the AI overhang; and 2) more specifically the OpenAI overhang (which we discuss below under Oracle). We would argue that both of these concerns will abate.

· SAP (SAP Best Ideas Deck , SAP Q3, Key Takeaway SAP Sapphire) is a classic compounder as it delivers double-digit revenue growth and YoY margin improvement through CY30 if not longer. SAP's multiple has also climbed down >30% over the last three quarters, offering a reasonable valuation for stock with an idiosyncratic growth engine minus the noise of AI cycle and large CAPEX overhang.

· Oracle (Q2FY26 earnings note, Key controversies & questions, modeling the Oracle opportunity) has a very different thesis this year than last year and one that is quite controversial as seen by the stock price roller coaster over the last year. Oracle's core business is incredibly valuable given the stickiness of its products and the stability of its customer base and that the core business is moving to the Cloud generating a significant lift in revenue and EPS (Link to Note). Oracle is winning market share in IaaS/PaaS driven by its unique OCI sovereign Cloud offerings. Most recently it captured massive wins, especially driven by OpenAI, for training and inferencing capacity increasing backlog to $523B+ in RPO. But investors are concerned about 1) how will Oracle fund the datacenter build out; 2) the effect of that build out on cash and FCF; and 3) Oracle's exposure to OpenAI. We believe the risks are far lower than is implied by the stock reactions and more than priced in, and see huge FCF operating profit dollar growth over the next 10 years.

· HubSpot (Upgrade note): We like HubSpot's positioning and execution in the SMB market. We also think that HubSpot will be a beneficiary of AI adoption within the CRM market. We expect HubSpot to continue to gain share and deliver above market growth. Improving business sentiment and a lower interest environment could be a potential tailwind through CY26. The valuation for HUBS is at a historic low-point which creates a nice entry point. We think CY26 guidance next month could be a clarifying event for the stock. We think risk reward trade-off is very attractive at this level.

- · MongoDB (MDB 3Q26): we like MongoDB as a long-term holding due to its exposure to a large and a fast-growing market. In the near-term, the stock should continue to benefit from 1) Revival in IaaS/PaaS consumption growth, 2) Increased focus on Enterprise customer, and 3) continued strength in new customer addition. We also get a sense that under the new CEO and CFO, MDB is striving to invigorate growth effort and improve financial visibility to reduce stock volatility. With the valuation multiple roughly doubling since the recent lows, we think the upside will be primarily driven by healthy 20%+ (est.) top-line growth in FY26. What would we do work on but wait to buy more? The next 2 names are show-me stories and once the street has more validation of growth these stocks could get very interesting.

- · Adobe (Adobe Q4. Key takeaways note) has been very controversial as concerns have increased that the company is going to be negatively impacted by Gen AI while management says (and we agree) that Gen AI will be a tailwind. But the company is not giving enough data to convince investors that it is a tailwind and the growth contribution from AI is not visible yet. However, with the stock trading at ~13x P/FE, for a high quality double-digit earnings growth business, we see risk reward setup is very favorable. If the valuation persists at these levels, we could see activist investors step in.

- · Workday (Q3 earnings, ) has also become a show me story as growth has decelerated and while the company has continued to deliver much better than generally expected margins, the focus has been on growth prospects. Interest in the stock, and in-bound call volumes are low as investors are fundamentally concerned growth will continue to decelerate as AI impacts the business. What is interesting about the concern is that it does not focus as much on enterprises building replacement HCM or ERP or even competitive pressure per se but on the effect of AI on enterprise hiring and thus Workday's HCM business something that if it were occur would have far bigger ramifications than just Workday and which we don't believe will happen in any meaningful investment horizon (Gen AI is a decade / multi-decade story). Meanwhile, management delivered preliminary (which they normally beat) FY27 subscription revenue growth guidance of 13% and continued margin improvement and return of cash. The stock is trading at the lowest PEG multiple (Exhibit 3) a ~47% PEG discount to the same time last year

(0.7x vs. 1.2x) which we believe is unreasonable given the value of the business and the stickiness of the solutions.

- · Salesforce (Q3 earnings, Key takeaways note) shifted from being perceived as an AI winner to an AI loser last year as Agentforce and related revenue was not big enough to accelerate growth and investor concern increased over AI disruption. While AI is likely to be an incremental revenue headwind due to disruption, longer term Agentforce and Data Cloud should be able to off set these headwinds, but it is not clear they will do a lot more. Fundamentally, the markets the company sells into are Cloud saturating and competition is increasing substantially, so the ability to accelerate growth other than via pricing is becoming more difficult and margin improvement is likely to slow. Our big concern is M&A and the possibility that with re-acceleration not happening the company turns to bigger and bigger and more and more expensive acquisitions to drive acceleration and this negatively impacts the stock and possibly the business.

- · Snowflake (Q3, Database Primer), we choose to remain on the sideline long-term even though near-term they could outperform. We worry about the long-term growth prospects. We think that the core data warehousing market is saturating and not decelerating. As databases move to the Cloud and everyone adds a data cloud there is a real question how valuable data warehousing will be. Driving above-market growth through share gains will get increasingly difficult as competition from existing vendors and newcomers intensifies. Newer products, aimed to expand out of the core market are still too early to supplement growth and AI is a highly competitive market where they are competing against much larger and more powerful competitors. In the near-term, we see FY27 (Jan-27) guidance as an overhang, however SNOW's valuation multiple (EV/ S) has corrected ~25% over the last three months, providing for interesting setup, once the FY27 guidance overhang has cleared.

Whether measured on a PEG ratio (Exhibit 3) or a EV/Sales/Growth ratio (Exhibit 5) valuations have come down for enterprise software driven, we believe, by concern over the potential impacts of AI (discussed earlier in the note). For some stocks the difference in the multiple is even larger on PEG:

· Workday's PEG valuation is almost ½ what it was a year ago and is trading at the lowest PEG in our coverage (0.7 - Exhibit 2) · Oracle is trading today at a 0.9x PEG vs 1.4x a year ago. Note that a year ago Oracle had very little AI exposure while today's valuation incorporates the roller coaster effect of massive AI training datacenter contracts, especially with OpenAI. · Salesforce held the highest PEG multiple at 2.2x last year (when AI was expected to be a near term tailwind) and is down to 1.2x. While this a substantial move it is interesting to compare today's valuation for Salesforce to SAP where it is trading at 1.2x vs SAP's 1.1x when we consider that SAP's revenue growth rate is higher and growth is accelerating and margins are not that significantly different on a GAAP vs IFRS basis.

Overall everyone's PEG multiple is down YoY and other than MongoDB (Exhibit 5), every other name in our coverage has seen their P/Sales multiple decease since roughly this time last year.

'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it 3 ' While the quote above is not strictly applicable to software we do believe that understanding the past can be helpful in understanding CY26 for software. Thus, we take a step back and look across our coverage and discuss our expectations for IT spending; the software / Cloud industry; and the impact of technology innovation, especially Generative AI. To place 2025 in perspective we first start by reviewing the past few years.

Once investors recognized that the Cloud transition created a revenue lift and in most cases the possibility of long term strong margins, we saw a lift in software multiples. Investors were 'betting' on the long term value of those companies visibly benefiting from Cloud (increasing multiples) while those that were perceived to be on the wrong side were punished (initially Microsoft, Oracle, SAP etc.). While there was variability on a company by company basis, this overall valuation perspective held through 2020, but not necessarily on a company by company basis (e.g. MSFT became the Cloud leader in many respects). 3 American philosopher George Santayana in his work The Life of Reason: Reason in Common Sense .

Along comes the pandemic and IT is given almost a blank check to do whatever is necessary to keep a company operating given the shift to work-from-home, and disruptions in business and supply chains. While there were some huge winners (where investors played the work-from-home trade), Software, after initial concerns was given a pass for unusual actions: some public companies gave employees bonuses (especially to sales even when deal closure was poor) to protect their employees and other companies wrote off real estate or took hits from canceled conferences (even though many companies received credits for future conferences).

Post pandemic, starting in 2021, the general belief within software and within investors was that everything was now going to move to the Cloud. At some level it made sense given how difficult it was for IT to get into their datacenters. We saw for many Cloud companies improved results and expectations that this improvement was going to continue. Multiples continued their strength as many expected an accelerated shift to the Cloud. Note that those perceived to be on the wrong side of the Cloud (e.g. Oracle and SAP) were punished.

The optimization cycle started or returned depending on your perspective in 2022. Senior management led by the CFO typically told IT they were spending too much, and they were subscribing for duplicate / overlapping solutions, signing up for services that were not complete or effectively used. What most investors do not realize is that for many Cloud companies there is a surprising amount of shelfware. Shelfware was one of the often unspoken truths of on-premise - companies buy far more licenses than they are ready to use. The theory was that the licenses would be used at some point and while the clients were paying fees for support for licenses they were not using it was not too large a price to pay given the 'discounts' they received.

What has likely surprised investors has been the fact that Shelfware (or its Cloud / subscription equivalent) exists within Cloud and that many Cloud companies have significant underutilized contracted capacity (either in seats or usage). Many software / Cloud companies do not allow their customers to meaningfully lower the # of subscriptions (or the contracted consumption) mid-contract. If it is allowed some increase the unit cost, often offsetting the changes. Before discussing the optimization cycle, we need to step back and discuss the shift of workloads to IaaS (and to a lesser extent PaaS). The traditional approach to shifting an existing workload to the Cloud has been to estimate what would be required in the Cloud. It is important to note that there is not a one-to-one mapping of running a workload on-premise and in the Cloud. The virtual machine sizes and configurations are different as are the options. IT therefore initially over configures and once the workload is operating smoothly in the Cloud they then tune the configurations (mostly down). This creates a cadence of migration and optimization.

But that changed with the rush to the Cloud starting in 2021. The migrations occurred but not so much the optimization phase (or phases as it could take a couple of iterations). In addition, IT did not feel the need to fully optimize (the workload is going to grow or clients want high performance). They ran lots of test environments they really did not need. Born in the Cloud vendors were not focused on costs, they were focused on growing as fast as they could. When optimization started (and born in Cloud felt margin pressure in many cases for the 1 st time) we saw a lot more optimization than one would expect. Optimization started with the largest budget items, where the contracts allowed variable usage / payment. We saw this at the 3 big hyperscale Cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft and Google). But it did not stop there. IT continued, and continues to a lesser extent today to optimize (in many cases a cadenced approach of shift to Cloud, see how it operates, and then optimize).

What about the shelfware SaaS and subscription? For contracts that allowed decreasing seat counts, in many cases it has happened but for those contracts that only allow changes at renewal - it is continuing to happen (and AI could create a new round of seat reduction). But it does not happen everywhere as many software / Cloud companies are pushing back and stating to clients that if they lower their seat count, the software company will increase unit costs. Growth slowed, concern increased about the sustainability of growth / was the Cloud transition over (which it is for some markets). Multiples came down.

Generative AI exploded on the world and most companies were swept up in the enthusiasm. Every software company was going to be a Gen AI beneficiary and most companies were going to see a visible ROI from the use of Gen AI. This drove not only multiple expansion in 2023, it drove expectations that 2024 would see budget increases and additional funding for Gen AI. One needs to remember that IT budgets, especially in the US, are normally created over the summer and finalized in the fall. In the summer of CY23, when CY24 budgets were being created, most software companies did not have mature in-market Gen AI solutions - therefore IT could not test and therefore validate that Gen AI would create value, Thus, the vast majority of IT organizations, we believe, could not put money in their budgets for off-the-shelf Gen AI apps. It was even worse for internally developed Gen AI

This did not mean that no one in software benefits, but the list was small (mostly the hyperscale Cloud providers and those offering GPU farms for model training). This led some investors to shift from software into semis as that is where the tailwind was being felt. 2024 was a bumpy year for the software industry, software investing, and our covered companies. Enthusiasm was too high in late 2023 due to: · Gen AI hype : Initial expectations in late 2023 was that Generative AI was going to be a big driver for software revenues in 2024, but relatively early in CY24 many investors realized that Gen AI was simply not going to be the tailwind initially anticipated. While the hype continued to be high, companies were struggling with delivering impactful Generative AI applications. · IT spending expectations : Many believed that as IT lapped the negative effects of the pull forward in IT spending in 2020 /2021 and the optimization processes of 2022 / 2023, IT spending growth would rebound helping software. Unfortunately, the effective IT spending growth was flattish.

When CY24 started, IT organizations were given a complex problem: they needed to continue to do everything they had been doing to support their organization, but they were also being told to deliver Generative AI (what that meant differed by organization and in many cases was not well-defined). Adding to the problem was the lack of a budget for Generative AI applications, development or even experimentation in many cases. IT had to invest resources without an additional allocation of money. They also needed to focus on a fast moving technology whose implications were not well understood. Their response was twofold:

1. Pull funds from the existing budget to invest in testing Gen AI : This meant delaying projects and continuing to optimize existing spending. 2. Pulling senior personnel to investigate Gen AI and Gen AI applications: While consumer Gen AI search tools (e.g. ChatGPT) were available and relatively intuitive, enterprise Gen AI was neither readily available nor intuitive. What was in market, even toward late in CY24, were early stage solutions - in fact we would argue that many (e.g. Office 365 Copilot) were at the level of traditional beta code rather than mature / production ready applications. In addition, there were four major problems with trying to build your own Gen AI applications: · It is not well understood what problems are best addressed with Gen AI; · Enterprise data was not ready for Gen AI; · Security and privacy issues have not been resolved; and · Hallucination concerns were real. The combined effect of delayed spending and limited senior personnel available for the day-to-day requirements of IT was seen quickly across many parts of software in general and our coverage specifically. Some areas, such as ERP Cloud migrations, took

longer to show the signs of the slowdown.

CY25 was impacted by two factors: macro and AI. · Macro was a biggie in CY25: On the macro front we all know that the world got more complex driven by · The US elections were a surprise to most and the Trump administration entered the White House with an aggressive agenda to drive change. Between DOGE which impacted US government spending and tariffs which hung over companies across the global, the normal pace of IT spending was at a minimum delayed during CY25 if not completely disrupted. · The increased focus on China by the US administration also added to concerns but less so, we believe, impacting spending. Note that on the AI side for hardware and semiconductors this was likely a bigger concern than on enterprise software. · War in both Ukraine and in the Middle East created spending disruptions and general concerns that also likely delayed or disrupted spending.

· Deglobalization become a priority (or larger priority) for many governments especially as it related to Cloud and software (Link to Note) and while the impact on existing spending was small (and continues to still have a relatively low impact for most of our coverage other than Oracle which it has helped) it created yet another factor for IT to have to think about. · Gen AI was topic # 1 for most IT organizations and for every company in our coverage (and most of enterprise software). But the real impact on IT and enterprise software companies were far different: · IT organizations had a better understanding of what they could and could not accomplish and focused more of their resources on off-the-shelf AI technology than developing their own AI solutions. This does not mean they did not kick-thetires on internally built Gen AI and in some limited number of cases started to do real development, pilots and in some rare cases go lives. But overall the focus, as seen in our recent CIO survey, was on what could be implemented with off-theshelf AI.

· Enterprise software / Cloud companies continued to be swept up by the possibilities and in some cases made it their primary marketing, if not development focus. But the reality was that in CY25 other than maybe Microsoft no public software company within our coverage or in fact no major software company generated substantial revenue from Gen AI and in the case of Microsoft most of that revenue was from Azure (IaaS/PaaS) plus a relatively small amount of revenue from their Copilots.

The huge spending on GPUs, AI servers, AI datacenters and model building while across software the infinitesimal revenue was seen in CY25. All the big hype by many software experts and leaders of software and tech companies as to the immediacy of AI combined with the lack of obvious / visible value creation for software companies either on the revenue side or cost savings helping margins led many investors to believe that software in general and enterprise software especially was going to be a loser rather than a winner from Gen AI (The ' AI eats software ' thesis). For many

Whether the winners would be startups or IT organizations building their own software, the effect was increased concern about enterprise apps and SaaS. We see this today in the valuations of Adobe, Salesforce and HubSpot and to a lesser extent Workday, SAP. It also fed the ' Are we in an AI bubble ' hypothesis which led to increased concern about those in software heavily investing in infrastructure (Microsoft and Oracle in our coverage). It also has led to the 'winner-take-all' mindset for model vendors. Till Mid to late CY25 OpenAI was generally believed to be the poster child for Gen AI and its way to a trillion-dollar valuation. Then Google came from the loser bucket into the winner bucket by delivering a 'better" model and executing very well on the search side. This led to negativity by some about OpenAI which in turn negatively impacted the OpenAI related companies - Microsoft and Oracle within our coverage.

Now we happen to believe there are numerous bubble-like characteristics to what we are seeing today, and we believe that there is over-enthusiastic and unrealistic expectations in parts of tech (not software) and we worry about the big statements some are making about how much global AI capacity will be required over the next couple of years. But Gen AI is real, it is simply the timeline is going to be longer than expected and there are going to be more bumps along the road. Concern over whether traditional software would win in an AI World started to appear. In some cases investors stepped to the side to wait and see while others became negative on software. In either case this impacted software valuations.

CY26 starts, as we said earlier, in a weird way for enterprise software. While Macro continues to be an overhang, we believe, that unless there is some major event (e.g. a disruptive new war in the Middle East that has a more global impact - which as we are writing is an increasing possibility), the sector will be more subdued, we believe (or maybe we hope), in CY26.

The Cloud migration is continuing, and we believe that the realization that for Gen AI to be successful enterprises are going to finally need to both get their data estate in order and move at least the most important data to the Cloud. This is one of the drivers of the tailwind we say late last year at Azure and in Oracle multi-Cloud strength, and we could see it at some of our covered companies (e.g. in ERP which would be good for SAP, Oracle and Workday). But for a wide range of areas including collaboration, sales force automation, service desk, and content creation the markets are Cloud saturating which means that what has been a tailwind to software growth for over 20 years is finally ending for sub-markets of software. Generative AI and company-specific fundamentals are going to drive stocks, we believe, far more than macro (excluding a major calamity or war). This does not mean we are expecting meaningful standalone Gen AI revenue driving revenue acceleration at many enterprise software companies. Rather, we are going to continue to hear from many enterprise software companies:

· How much more effective Gen AI will make development and operations in general even though in few cases it will improve margins meaningfully. · That their Gen AI apps are being adopted and driving revenue or ARR (Annual Recurring revenue) but unfortunately in most cases the numbers will be still be small compared to total revenue and the definitions will not be clean enough for investors to gain confidence that this revenue is net new revenue and not driven by bundling or re-definition of revenue. The direct effect on software companies and software stocks in CY 2026 will be, we believe:

· Volatility will be higher than normal as investors look for validation proof, whether positive or negative and the impact will be higher the greater the perceived AI exposure. Within our coverage this will be Oracle, Microsoft, Adobe, Salesforce, HubSpot, and likely Snowflake. Workday and MongoDB will be less impacted and SAP likely will have little or no impact from AI news flow. · While Gen AI is driving the conversation, it is not driving the results for most software stocks and especially our coverage . · GenAI revenues in totality across enterprise application software is still going to be quite small in CY26, but there will be areas of impact including the hyperscalers (including Microsoft and Oracle), Microsoft Copilot and possibly Adobe (but we may not know if the company does not supply more information). Across the rest of our coverage the stand-alone revenue will continue to be relatively small and not move the needle in CY26 while for some the ending CY26 AI ARR could start to look interesting.

· AI does not eat enterprise software: Enterprises are not going to develop their own apps to replace important enterprise apps using Gen AI tools at least during any reasonable investment horizon and especially in CY26. · Agentic AI is still very early days : Building stand-alone relatively simple Agentic functionality and apps is doable today, especially by SaaS vendors who have the knowledge, access to the data / semantic knowledge, and ability to easily perform actions within their systems, and we can see this at most of our covered companies. But building complex agents that pulls in data from disparate sources and performs a range of actions (especially in systems that the developer of the agent did not develop) is currently quite difficult and fraught with issues. Delivering a true /generic Agentic platform is expecting all but a handful of IT organizations to develop impactful agents is still simply to early.

· Expectations continue to be high, and it is going to take more time but long term the technology will be ready for prime time. There is a lot of fundamental research and development ahead for complex agentic platforms to be usable by more than bleeding edge development organizations. · Today the revenue tailwind that some hope for in enterprise platforms and app vendors could start in CY27 but more likely in CY28 and will take time to ramp as vendors and customers learn from failures and successes.

· Enterprise AI adoption : CY26 will still be more of an earlier adopter time than the big Gen AI year. We expect to see more Gen AI functionality and applications (and apps that are defined as Gen AI when in fact they have little or no Gen AI or even AI) but pure revenue generation will still be relatively small, and for most companies their 'AI revenue' or 'AI ARR' will continue to grow, but we will likely only see a couple of cases across our coverage where investors can see a positive impact of AI on total revenue. This is due to many factors impacting the customer, the vendor, and the technology. · The fact that some software vendors are touting big AI numbers 4 , but growth has not changed is causing some of the negativity across software.

· For any software company reading this: you may be doing your company and your investors a dis-service by simply calling out the numbers without a lot more context. Investors will be concerned that the AI revenue is being generated at the expense of core revenue, so please be careful how you frame this. Of course, driving usage is key as it could turn into real revenue, but please don't misstate how much customers are really incrementally paying or investors will expect AI driven acceleration to early. · This does not mean we are not seeing AI tailwinds, but most of those tailwinds are at 1) startups who have no other revenue streams; 2) at hyperscalers (Microsoft and Oracle in our coverage); and possibly in CY26 at a couple of our covered companies, likely in late CY26. By CY27 AI should be a real business for many enterprise software companies and then the question will be: ' is it additive or does it replace traditional products and revenue ' - but this can only be answered on a company by company and product by product basis.

While all of our covered companies are using models from the leading Frontier model companies, especially OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI most of our coverage are not going to be meaningfully impacted (if at all) by news flow relating to the model companies. But Oracle and Microsoft are very tightly intertwined with OpenAI. Currently, we are seeing, we believe, the 'winner-takes-all' mindset especially amongst investors in which one model will be dominant in technologically, usage, and revenue - this rarely occurs in software and given the current rate of innovation and competition is unlikely, we believe, to happen with frontier models. We believe that there will not be a single frontier model created in the foreseeable future (and especially in CY26) that is significantly ahead of its competitors and thus owns the market. In fact, we would argue that multiple times during CY26 we will see a different 'leading' model.

Early last year OpenAI was the leader, but that has changed and the fall from leader position has negatively impacted both Oracle and Microsoft. We believe that this perception is wrong for 3 reasons: - · Today Gemini 5 is perceived as the leader to OpenAI's perceived detriment, but that is likely going to change and when that does the negativity on OpenAI will decrease. In fact, while OpenAI's revenue growth rate has grew ~380% YoY in October (Exhibit 7), even as concerns impacted both Oracle and Microsoft stock. 4 Adobe and others are calling out how much of revenue is being impacted by AI which is incrementally better but still begs the question of when / how much AI will drive new revenue and how much AI could impact margins. 5 Gemini is owned by Google which is covered by the US Internet team.

· Note the impact on Oracle has been pronounced and one of the drivers of Oracle's multiple decline, while with Microsoft it can be seen in the fact that Microsoft announced an updated agreement (Link) with OpenAI that included ~$250B in Azure usage commitments and the stock price barely moved. · While OpenAI's models are key to OpenAI's business strategy, if we look at the projected revenues for OpenAI published last year in The Information we see that OpenAI's revenue is predominantly (> 80% - Exhibit 6) driven the apps they are building on their models. This trend can be seen in the recent OpenAI Healthcare announcement and their recent acquisition (Link) as they expand the range of consumer and commercial app revenue streams. Therefore, while model quality is important, model dominance may not be.

One other point that we believe is important and that is, that we do not believe that OpenAI has signed non-cancelable datacenter commitments worth $1.4T (Link). We believe that for contracted / non-cancelable contracts the number is in fact a fraction and will ramp up over likely the next 4-5 years and each contract tranche will be of a 4-5 year duration. In other words, OpenAI's annual commitments will ramp over the next 4-5 years and is commitment to a much smaller annual number than the street believes. In summary, when thinking about both Oracle and Microsoft the question is not how profitable will OpenAI be, the question is will OpenAI be able to pay for the usage it has contracted for. EXHIBIT 6: OpenAI is projecting ~20B in revenue in 2029 from APIs (3rd party use of OpenAI models)

In summary Generative AI is still very much an early stage / maturing technology which is going to take time to have as large an impact on enterprise software as many on the street expect. Specifically, · Consumer is different from enterprise, especially as it relates to the adoption of Generative AI. We therefore strongly recommend that readers do not interpolate from what they see in the technology maturation rate or adoption rate in consumer to be a proxy for what will happen and when it will happen in enterprise software. · Off-the-shelf Enterprise Gen AI applications will become more mature and more available in CY26 (a year later than we originally expected) but there will be only a few companies that can validate real / meaningful revenues from Gen AI in CY26. CY27 will be better but not all enterprise software/Cloud companies will see a tailwind from Gen AI.

· Enterprise built Generative AI solutions are still in the early days as there are issues with: 1) leveraging corporate data; 2) data security and privacy; and 3) corporate does not know what problems are best solved with Gen AI. We expect an increase in enterprise Gen AI apps in CY27 and more in CY28 (again a year later than we thought this time last year). · Agentic AI is the new buzz, but it too will take time. What is in market today called Agentic AI is not, in many cases, Agentic AI it is semi-automated Gen AI or the older bot technology recycled with better interfaces due to Gen AI.

Before going into the specific investment updates we want to step up a level and give you our opinion of what to own and why. Should you own Software? The simple answer is yes, and we expect interest in software to increase through CY26. In fact, we are already seeing a shift from big picture discussions on the future of software to far more targeted discussions on specific stocks and this will only, we believe, increase. This is because investors, we believe, are 1) gaining increasing confidence and knowledge in the timing and impact of AI; and 2) stock prices are down, creating much more attractive entry points; and 3) the shift to semis is over and the shift back to software is about to start.

Your time horizon and willingness to see valuations bump around should inform you investments in software over at least the 1 st half of CY26. Generative AI will continue to create a lot of news and noise and there are so many that are making very big statements about the impact of Gen AI as well as companies / founders that are pushing aggressive statements and numbers. There are also going to be big announcements about major innovations in models and market changing technologies and this is going to impact stocks both positively and negatively. It is therefore even more important than most years to own stocks that have deep moats, strong differentiation, and real sustainable businesses. But you can also make shorter term money on mis-valuations - and we are going to see more of those this year as news flow will drive sentiment. One need only look back to that crazy weekend / early part of the week after the Deepseek models came out (DeepSeek: Where and why could it impact software?).

Yes we said this in our CY25 outlook note and Microsoft did deliver the 3 things that investors were looking for: CAPEX deceleration, Azure revenue acceleration and clarification of the relationship with OpenAI. But concerns have returned and the stock is down from its highs and Microsoft is not the most crowded name in software, which we believe it should be, given 1) the quality of the business; 2) the sustainability of growth; 3) the ability of the company to deliver margin improvement; and 4) sustained return of cash. To understand the setup going forward we need to understand what happened last year. By mid-CY25 investors saw the 3 things they were looking for, and the stock reacted positively driven by:

· CAPEX growth decelerated early last year which was good as investors were concerned that the company was spending on AI capacity that would not drive high value revenue. We laid out last January in Microsoft: Flashback to the Cloud build-out. Why we think Capex decelerates and Azure accelerates meaningfully how CAPEX would slow and Azure would accelerate and that in fact happened. CAPEX investment did in fact accelerate later last year, but this was driven by increasing immediate customer demand and was tied more to hardware than datacenter. · Azure growth accelerated in Q3 and Q4 FY25 with surprisingly strong growth and growth acceleration for non-AI workloads. In fact, management has been calling out that demand for non-AI workloads including acelerated Cloud migrations would sustain.

· In addition, we showed that AI margins were healthy (GM in the 40s) and improved ~4500bps in 4 quarters which pointed to continued AI margin improvement. We called out (Global Software: Why you want to own Microsoft - Key takeaways from meetings & marketing with management) management improving commentary on long term AI margins being similar to nonAI margins. Management then announced that the agreement had been updated with OpenAI and the stock should have moved up meaningfully, but it did not. The agreement: 1. Secured for Microsoft access to OpenAI's IP and products created through 2032 (excluding devices) 2. Microsoft also gets access to OpenAI IP for internal research through 2030 and can now independently pursue AGI. 3. The agreement essentially ring-fences enterprise-centric workloads from OpenAI for Azure 4. OpenAI has contracted to purchase $250 billion in Azure services. 5. The Microsoft -OpenAI revenue share agreement remains in effect until AGI is achieved, although payments will be made over a longer period of time 6. Microsoft retained 27% ownership in recapitalized OpenAI.

Yet, the Microsoft stock did not move up on the announcement and in fact moved down the next day when Azure growth beat guidance and sell-side expectations and slightly missed the buy-side expectations. The reasons for both why the stock did not move up on the OpenAI agreement and then moved down on earnings is important to understand some of the main reasons we like the stock and would buy it now both for near-term and long term reasons.

· The AI is a bubble overhang is impacting Microsoft and especially Azure AI. As mentioned earlier investors have taken a 0 / 1 (black / white) view of AI. For many Google is now perceived to be the leader in Gen AI having flipped from a loser in a relatively short period of time and OpenAI has flipped from the winner to the loser and if OpenAI will be a loser then anyone tied to OpenAI is also a loser including Microsoft and Oracle in our coverage. This means that 1) the $250B commitment is worthless; and 2) If OpenAI's models are not the leading models and Google's are then Azure AI will lose out over time. We disagree and will discuss in a moment. · AI will eat software : We are in a moment in the software investment cycle when you need to beat to see your stock go up. If you don't beat you are not a winner (and likely a loser). In Microsoft's case this is 2-fold: 1) Azure did not beat, and 2) the street is not convinced about Copilot.

We believe that these concerns, while valid, are overblown and that in fact Microsoft is positioned to deliver sustained growth and in fact incrementally improving margins with CAPEX growth slowing over time. Breaking this into the key drivers we believe that:

· Azure growth : Microsoft is in a relatively unique position right now. Demand exceeds supply and Microsoft is aggressively adding supply in addition, Microsoft has levers it can (and we believe will push) to deliver stronger than expected Azure growth next quarter and for a number of quarters thereafter. · The capacity limitation is not hardware which was not very fungible, it is rack space in datacenters that is ready for servers. To meet the very strong and increasing demand and demand signals Microsoft is continuing to build / improve datacenters. They are continuing to lease datacenters, but now they have moved to shorter term rental of capacity from the NeoClouds. This we believe is a stop-gap until more Microsoft owned / long term leased datacenter capacity is online, but it will help Microsoft meet their demand. We believe that as the company shifts from CAPEX driven by building capacity that drives long-term capacity to adding hardware Microsoft will be adding capacity far quicker than the street expects. Note that over the last 2 quarters we have seen this shift and it will continue.

· Microsoft can also shift around their datacenter capacity priorities. These are using capacity for 1) Azure; 2) SaaS and AI apps; 3) Internal use (especially model building). Management on their last earnings call and during our meetings with them (link) explained that every week the executive teams has to make the difficult discussion on where to allocate resources and especially datacenter capacity. Management can in theory allocate incrementally more capacity toward Azure and away from SaaS and AI apps and/or internal use. With the recently announced contracts with Neocloud (e.g. Nscale, Nebius and CoreWeave) Microsoft could, we believe, shift around their priorities and incrementally lower their capacity allocations internally to drive stronger Azure revenue growth. While this is not without its long term implications, depending on how much and for how long, it would likely satisfy investors on both the top and bottom line especially when one considers the significant capacity they have added with Neoclouds.

· To highlight this issue we point to the recent statement by management 'The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it's power - it's sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power,' Nadella said. 'So, if you can't do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can't plug in. In fact, that is my problem today. It's not a supply issue of chips; it's actually the fact that I don't have warm shells to plug into.' (Link) · OpenAI : Fundamentally investors have 2 main concerns relating to the business relationships between Microsoft and OpenAI which are overhanging the stock and which we believe are wrong: 1) The sustainability of OpenAI's revenue; and 2) what happens to Microsoft AI if OpenAI is a laggard or loser in AI?.

· Sustainability of OpenAI revenue: It is interesting how investors have moved to a 'winners-take-all' mindset with AI and especially as it relates to OpenAI and its contracts with Microsoft and Oracle.

· OpenAI is currently by far Microsoft's largest Azure AI customer and that revenue today is from OpenAI running ChatGPT and its other AI services on Azure. Microsoft announced in October that OpenAI had committed to spending $250B for Azure services but as seen in the street's reaction to the October announcement and consensus models it would seem that the street is not including any upside to expectations from the commitment. In fact, based on the conversations we have had with our clients, we believe, that there is a concern as to the sustainability of that OpenAI usage of Azure AI. We believe this concern, while reasonable for any Gen AI business today given the immaturity of the market, is way overblown. OpenAI has shown their ability to drive innovation, drive usage (which has grown even with Google increasing their market share), and even monetizing that usage. In fact, OpenAI may be capturing more standalone Gen AI consumer (or enterprise) revenue than anyone else.

· We do not believe that there will be one winner in frontier models or in the apps built onto one of those models by the frontier model companies and especially OpenAI. We believe that OpenAI will continue to have success and grow their user base and revenue, especially as they branch into more specialized AI offerings (e.g. the recently announced Healthcare solutions). For the purposes of OpenAI and Microsoft (and also Oracle) it does not matter how profitable OpenAI is, in fact to an extent it does not matter how fast revenue grows - it simply matters whether OpenAI will be able to pay for the Azure usage it is contracting for whether from revenue or funds raised. Given that both consensus and investors are not giving Microsoft credit for the $250B commitment announced in October and only for the revenue (with some growth) captured today from OpenAI all investors should consider is will OpenAI sustain and grow over time. If the answer is yes (and we believe strongly that it will) then this overhang is overblown. In fact, If one assumes that the OpenAI spending with Microsoft grows to

$25B / year over time (it takes 10+ years for OpenAI to spend their commitment) then Azure expectations are low and if one assumes it grows over time to $50B or 5+ years to meet the commitment than the Azure expectations over the next few years are quite low.

· The 2 nd part of the OpenAI concern is what happens long term to OpenAI spending with Microsoft but again if you believe it takes 10+ years for OpenAI to spend the $250B (and we think it will be less than that) then whatever happens is beyond any reasonable investment horizon. · OpenAI models: We have heard from many clients the question of what happens to Microsoft's AI business if OpenAI's model significantly lag the market leader, which today is believed to be Google. · Investors are concerned that Microsoft's AI business would shift to Google. While an interesting question and would have relevance at the extreme where OpenAI's frontier model(s) are much weaker - the misunderstanding, we believe, in this concern is two-fold: · The reality is that Microsoft's clients are enterprises and enterprises are going to use Microsoft predominantly and not Google for their apps; · While enterprises are using frontier models, an increasing percentage of enterprise apps at SaaS vendors and at enterprises are being built with smaller / specialized models and the frontier model conversation is therefore not really relevant.

· Microsoft is quite cognizant of being too exposed to OpenAI models. Again, we believe (and we believe that Microsoft believes) that OpenAI will deliver competitive / industry leading models but management wants to be more agnostic, especially if there will be use cases where different models are better than others (no one model wins nor does one model do everything great). The company has expanded their support to > 1000 models including other frontier models and Microsoft is investing to build their own models. This drive to build their own frontier and specialized models can be seen in the commentary last quarter that Microsoft is using significant datacenter resources for their own model training and even in the wording of the updated agreement with OpenAI, Microsoft has '… IP rights to research, defined as the confidential methods used in the development of models and systems, will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030, whichever is first.' In other words, Microsoft is not just building models, they are able to leverage what OpenAI is doing to build models to assist Microsoft in building industry leading models of their own.

· We would argue that Microsoft will be very well positioned with the clients for the apps but also for the best depth and breadth of Gen AI models and development technology. · Copilot overhang : Initially there was over-optimism regarding Office 365 Copilot in late CY23. When the street realized that Copilot revenue was going to take more time than investors hoped, concerns started to build up and some investors moved out of the name. We believe that at this point most investors have limited expectations relating to Microsoft Copilot. While we agree that Copilot has under-delivered the initial high expectations our checks are showing that users like the technology and do not want to give it up. We also expect that Office 365 Copilot will continue to improve and that based on our conversations with management (Link to note) we believe all the Copilots will help drive Microsoft revenue in general and sustain Microsoft Office growth Where does this leave us? We believe that:

· The business is one of the best run and delivers low downside risk (excluding macro issues) and sustained growth over numerous years. · Azure : Azure revenue growth is going to at least sustain, if not accelerate through CY26. · CAPEX growth will decelerate. CAPEX, in CY26 is going to grow meaningfully slower and the rate of growth will continue to decelerate until CAPEX is growing, once again, slower than Cloud revenue. In addition, the mix of CAPEX spending drivers will continue to shift from 60% of CAPEX last year to > 50% this year and possible even 40%. This means that the time from CAPEX spending to revenue will shorten significantly making CAPEX an incrementally better leading indicator of Cloud growth. · Office 365 growth will sustain at similar rates and slow over a longer period of time. In a market where enterprise software growth is generally slowing we really like Microsoft and would recommend everyone has it in their portfolio.

The Oracle story changed substantially last year and not because our thesis was wrong but because the Oracle story shifted to being all about AI and AI training datacenters from 1) ERP moving to Cloud; 2) database moving to Cloud; and 3) Oracle winning OCI (IaaS/PaaS) business predominantly at sovereigns. Our original thesis components are still very much in effect and will drive, by themselves, revenue growth and strong margins but with the announcement of $300B+ in new OCI AI revenue backlog, everyone has become myopically focused on the Oracle AI story, which is not unreasonable given how impactful this additional business will be (Link to Note)

The Oracle stock has been on a roller coaster for all of CY25 as closing large AI contracts drove up and then drove down the stock price. Today the stock is trading below its valuation prior to the announcement of $300B of backlog driven by OCI (and especially the OpenAI multi-year contract). In fact, Oracle has become the proxy for not just AI but more specifically OpenAI success as investors are concerned that: · That Oracle will have difficulty raising and then servicing the debt required to build all their OCI commitments. · That OpenAI may not require / pay for all the capacity that Oracle is building for them · That these contracts will not renew and when that happens Oracle will be stuck with datacenters and servers capacity.

We understand the investor concern, but we believe that the downside risks are overblown and that the stock will appreciate substantially not just over the next 10 years, as discussed in Oracle: Implications of updated OCI guidance ($144B in FY30) over the next 5 to 10 years, but even over the next 12 months, as both the Oracle debt / CAPEX questions and the OpenAI business quality and longevity questions start to be answered and Oracle executes better than the current valuation implies. At a high level:

· Near term downside risk : Oracle has far more flexibility relating to the build-out than investors are giving it credit and that the downside risk from its customers (and especially OpenAI) not living up to contracted non-cancelable contracts is far lower than implied by the valuation. So long as OpenAI did not fail then Oracle may not capture the revenue growth, but they are unlikely to be hit by substantial costs and since the stock price implies that the $317B has no or negative value, as long as Oracle does not incur meaningful cost in a downside scenario then the risk is quite low. Again we believe that OpenAI will continue to grow and will live up it to its commitments but understanding the downside is very important.

· Hardware CAPEX: Oracle's CAPEX is predominantly hardware and Oracle will be building and installing the server and infrastructure hardware in a relatively short period of time (possibly 3 months) prior to each major datacenter go-live. This means if a contract is delayed or a client reneges / renegotiates on their capacity commitments Oracle can delay or cancel the hardware until very close to the go live. This substantially limits the risk and since there are numerous datacenters going live between FY27 and FY30 the downside /exposure for Oracle will be relatively small. · Note that the Oracle backlog is non-cancelable contracts which means that the client is on the hook for the contract capacity / revenue to Oracle which means that unless they go bankrupt also limits the risk substantially.

· Datacenters : Oracle has already contracted for all the datacenter capacity they will need to deliver on the $317B in backlog (and likely more). These contracts are for 15 to 19 years and have a total value of $248B. They are each comprised of multiple datacenters that will go-live over the next 4+ years. Investors, we understand, are concerned as to what Oracle would do with these commitments if their OCI clients and especially OpenAI were to renege or renegotiate. · In the case that OpenAI delays we would expect they would pay any costs Oracle would incur which means Oracle would not capture the revenue, but they would also incur no costs.

· If the datacenter capacity was not needed then Oracle could offer it to other clients or if substantial capacity sub-lease it to the other hyperscalers (or others). As we have seen with Microsoft and others in the market there is a major short fall in hot datacenter capacity (powered sq. ft) and we believe Microsoft or another hyperscaler would gladly sub-lease the capacity leaving Oracle with little or no cost, or if it happened near term then likely a profit. · Margins : Oracle has already guided to the gross margins for their new OCI revenue and while the gross margins will be lower than core Oracle gross margins we have shown Link to Note that this business will be very EPS and FCF accretive and value creating.

Don't forget about the rest of the business. Last October when Oracle laid out their 1 st 5-year guidance of $104B in revenue and operating margins in the mid-40s for FY29 we showed that Oracle could accomplish this growth (Oracle: What do you need to believe?) via a combination of 1) ERP continuing to move to the Cloud, but at a decelerating pace; 2) OCI growth driven primarily by capturing a relatively small portion of the sovereign Cloud market (<15%) and 3) database moving incrementally to the Cloud helped by Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

The SAP story in some ways is quite simple and much better understood than either Oracle or Microsoft than it has been in recent history. While it is not a crowded stock per se, it is well owned within its core European focused investor base but not that well owned across software investors. Until earlier this year the opportunity was purely one of a YoY compounder rather than a big opportunity for multiple improvement. But that has incrementally changed as the stock is down ~20% from its July high as investor concerns have increased about the sustainability of growth. We believe that SAP can drive strong double-digit revenue growth through at least CY30 if not to CY32 and beyond via a combination of

· Existing Customers: Moving their installation base to the Cloud and capturing a 2x to 3x revenue lift; · New customers: SAP is capturing new customers. ERP is moving to the Cloud, and we estimate that ~40% of the onpremise installs are using solutions that do not have a viable Cloud offering. · We recently wrote a joint note discussing the opportunity for new customers and new workload growth from the supply chain opportunity (SAP: Supply Chain, a strategic growth driver through 2030). · Capturing their fair share (or better) of the ~40% of the ERP market that we believe is in play; · Upsell: Driving 30-40% of growth from upselling new modules, The Business Technology Platform, the Business Data Cloud, and supply chain. They also have the ability to drive sustained margin improvement each year during this transition via a combination of driving operating leverage and operating efficiency.

When SAP announced in late 2020 an update to their mid-term guidance, they did not articulate well that the company was about to drive a major Cloud transition. That process started to become evident when they launched Rise with SAP in Feb of 2021 (SAP - Updating our thesis after Rise with SAP and Q4 earnings) and became progressively more obvious over time SAP was moving their on-premise ERP customers to Cloud, capturing a revenue lift and signing up new Cloud customers. They were also initially driving operational and technological efficiency, especially for their acquired Cloud offerings, which until recently hurt margins. But the headwind from moving everything to one tech platform is over and from here on the company can drive margin improvement. It is important to note the quality of the business:

· Durable demand: Its revenue is predominantly from the largest companies in the world and its workloads, especially ERP which is the lion's share of revenue, is very stable and transitioning to the Cloud. · Sustainable Cloud transition: It is in the early days of one of the last major Cloud transitions. · Management is focused for the 1 st time in a long time on driving operational efficiency which will translate in margin improvement. The net effect is that SAP can be a sustainable compounder with revenue growth in the teens, steady margin improvement and return of cash. That means EPS and FCF should grow in the mid-teens or higher.

One of the more controversial stocks we cover has been Adobe. The stock had been the darling of software investors for many years, but then growth slowed, and the street looked for reasons to worry. Many focused on competition to the Creative Cloud and the potential risks of Generative AI replacing Adobe core creative solutions. Recently concerns have yet again increased that the company is going to be negatively impacted by Gen AI while management says (and we agree) that Gen AI will be a tailwind. But the company is not giving enough data to convince investors that AI will be a tailwind.

This concern has not changed in over a year but what has changed is that the level of interest in the stock increased substantiallly in CY25. It started early in the year and reached a point where ~1/3 of our in-bound calls were with clients who did not own the stock but were looking at the stock. The conversation normally started with ' Adobe screens cheap and if you can believe that growth will not substantially decelerate then it is worth owning given the rate of growth and the margins' By mid-year the rate of in-bound slowed, and early this year the pace has picked up again which is an important factor to concern - if Adobe can prove they are not decelerating now or in the near future than there is an untapped investor base that drives the stock price.

Today Adobe is an interesting investment opportunity as investors have low expectations and the multiple has come down substantially. However, near term Adobe is an 'explain to me and show me story' and herein lies the problem. The concern overhanging Adobe (even more than many other companies in our coverage) is that AI is going to eat Adobe's business and disproving that negative is really difficult since the concern is for the future far more than for today and the time horizon is relatively nebulous. There are two ways that the bear case can be completely disproven:

· Adobe beats and raises enough that it is obvious that the business is solid (and not tied to a massive price increase). Solid, irrefutable proof would work for Adobe's stock (and for a number of others in our coverage. · Detailed data may not completely disprove the bear case, but it would, we believe, lead to those that are on the sidelines investing in Adobe and driving the stock up. The question is what would that data be. We would argue (and we have discussed much of this with management) that investors need to see the data on a consistent basis (preferably quarterly and with at least 3 if not 5 years of historical were applicable): 1) has Creative Cloud seat churn changed (please give #s and not just commentary); 2) Creative Cloud seat growth (because we need to see that revenue growth is being driven more by seat growth than pricing); and 3) standalone new product AI ARR as it validates that there is a new revenue stream.

· Management, it would seem, is using the AI attach to revenue metric instead of the standalone new product AI ARR as it shows AI is permeating the offerings. We understand the value of this data, but investors need to see not just that the current revenue is safe but that new revenue streams and sustainable growth is important and not just from purely from raising prices for the same product. · Another option management could supply would be to supply AI Monthly Active Users and the conversion rate from AI MAU to paid users.

So, why do we have an Outperform? The answer is simply we believe based on our technology background that the moat around the business (and especially the Creative business) is strong and Adobe is innovating fast enough to gain more their fair share of the expanding TAM (and yes we believe there is an expanding TAM created by the democratization of creativity created by AI). We have held numerous calls with creative professionals and users of Adobe (and its leading competitors) creative solutions and have met with management in December (Link) and we believe that while the data is not there to prove out the future we like the technology opportunity. At this price point the reward is far greater than the downside risk to the stock, so we maintain our Outperform rating but can not say how many quarters it will take till it is visible in the numbers.

Salesforce is interesting and controversial. The stock has underperformed over the last year and for many of the same reasons as Adobe - Salesforce has shifted from an AI winner to an AI loser as growth decelerated, management called out how valuable and big their AI offerings would be and this did not materialize in revenue. In fact, Salesforce's management pounded the table more on their AI related offerings (Agentforce and Data Cloud) than Adobe and the sell side jumped on the AI driven acceleration bandwagon (which did not happen or at least not to the same extent with Adobe). Salesforce is also under attack from both AI startups and public companies but the attackers in Salesforce's case are Microsoft and ServiceNow as compared in most cases to much smaller private and a few public entities.

At a high level we believe that Salesforce's core growth problem is that they are predominantly in Cloud saturating (e.g. Sales, Service, analytics, marketing) or Cloud saturated (e.g. collaboration) and while they were hurt (also similar to Adobe) to revenue pull forward during or shortly after the pandemic the fundamental businesses are slowing to the natural growth rate of software (mid to high single digits depending on the ability to take price). AI does make parts of Salesforce's business more easily threatened, especially service as service desks are one of the poster children for Gen AI success but Salesforce does have a strong relationship with their customer and their largest customers own a broad range of Salesforce offerings that are bundled which leads us to believe that Gen AI, at least for the next year or two, will slow growth incremental more than impact overall growth.

The company has countered very aggressively by launching and relaunching their AI offerings which are now mainly called Agentforce and offering data federation and access capabilities via the Data Cloud. They even bought Informatica to expand the reach of their data access capabilities. We believe that Salesforce will have some success with AI in their core businesses, but we do not believe the big dream that Agentforce will be the agentic platform on which enterprises will build Agents beyond core CRM functionality to any meaningful extent. We believe that AI will run where the data resides. This, we believe, limits the upside to countering the negative effects of AI and maybe a bit more over multiple years. Then why an underperform on Salesforce? Our fundamental concern is that the management team is growth centric and when core growth slows they turn to large scale M&A and large, impactful M&A that can accelerate long term growth is expensive and difficult, and we worry that the company will turn in this direction which will negatively impact the stock.

While we agree with Marc Benioff that the fears of AI are overstated we also believe the upside expectations are still too high and worry about an increasing number and size of M&A and the impact that will have on the financials and the fundamentals of the business.

Workday (Q3 earnings) generates its revenue from HCM, Financials and related solutions. This market is still relatively early in its transition to the Cloud (Global Software Primer: Is ERP the next big Cloud transition story?) creating a sustainable growth opportunity. But the uncertain macro environment, which has impacted hiring and thus HCM and large projects combined with the ongoing distraction for IT management from AI have impacted Workday's near-term growth prospects. Workday has also become a show me story as growth has decelerated and while the company has continued to deliver much better than generally expected margins, the focus has been on growth prospects. Interest in the stock, and in-bound call volumes are low as investors are fundamentally concerned growth will continue to decelerate as AI impacts the business.

What is interesting about the concern is that it does not focus as much on enterprises building replacement for HCM or ERP or even competitive pressure per se but on the effect of AI on enterprise hiring and thus Workday's HCM business - something that if it were to occur would have far bigger ramifications than just Workday and which we don't believe will happen in any meaningful investment horizon (Gen AI is a decade / multi-decade story). But even as it relates to Workday, pricing is not predominantly based on seats but rather modules and the size of the customer. This means that any lose of HR personnel does no meaningfully impact Workday revenue. Meanwhile, management delivered preliminary (which they normally beat) FY27 subscription revenue growth guidance of 13% and continued margin improvement and return of cash. The stock is trading at the lowest PEG multiple (Exhibit 3) a ~47% PEG discount to the same time last year (0.7x vs. 1.2x) which we believe is unreasonable given the value of the business.

Snowflake's growth rate has stabilized in CY25, after decelerating massively in the prior four years. From a business perspective, we see this stabilization as a result of multiple factors: · Normalization of Y/Y consumption demand and flush-out of difficult compares from post pandemic demand surge. · Revival in consumption demand · Stabilization of impact from competitive pressure, that had intensified over the last year. · Better than expected results on some newer product initiatives and less than expected negative impact from some headwinds (Iceberg). For additional details, please see our prior note (SNOW 3Q26 review)

As we look forward to CY26, we think that momentum in IaaS/PaaS Consumption demand coupled with potentially lower interest environment should still benefit SNOW. However, last year SNOW also benefited from easier comps, which would no longer be the case this year, and it is difficult to break out exactly how much of the growth stabilization in CY25/FY26 was due to easier comps vs. consumption demand strength. So it is difficult to gain confidence in growth acceleration for CY26/FY27. In balance, valuation on SNOW has climbed down ~25% over the last three months. Therefore, in the near-term, we see next year (FY27) guidance in Feb as an overhang for the stock, and we would recommend staying on the sideline until we get more clarity for next year.

Over the long term, we choose to remain on the side line as we worry about the long-term growth prospects. We think that the core data warehousing market is saturated and decelerating. Driving above-market growth through share gain will get increasingly difficult as competition from existing vendors (database providers, hyperscalers) and newcomers (e.g. Databricks, SaaS app vendors potentially) intensifies.

In addition, we wonder if data warehousing will be as important in a world where more / most important on-premise database moves to the Cloud and every SaaS vendor and hyperscaler offers their own data federation / data Cloud. We acknowledge Snowflake has launched multiple new product initiatives to expand out of the data warehousing market and expand its TAM. We think these newer initiatives are still in early stages and have numerous competitors including the largest Cloud vendors, and we need to see some proof points before assuming meaningful future growth contribution from. We also worry on the AI enthusiasm given how competitive the AI platform market is and fundamentally SNOW is sitting on the 3 largest AI platform vendors (Microsoft, Google, Amazon)

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented, general-purpose database. It is available both as an on-premise license software and as a cloud-based service on the three large hyperscale cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, and GCP). As a NoSQL / document database, MongoDB affords a more flexible and intuitive data organization, making it easier for developers to work with the database. NoSQL database technology, like MongoDB, offers several advantages like flexibility, ease of use, reliability, and scalability at a lower cost. Furthermore, as MongoDB is available both on-premise and as a cloud-based service, customers can use the MongoDB platform in any environment, depending on their operational requirements: fully managed as a service or selfmanaged in the cloud, on-premise, or a hybrid environment. MongoDB's business model combines the developer mind share and adoption benefits of open-source software with the economic benefits of a proprietary software subscription business model.

Unlike many software companies built around open source projects, MongoDB owns the intellectual property of their core offerings, allowing them to retain control over their products. While MongoDB has capabilities that could, in theory, allow it to one day compete for a broader range of workloads, the company's (and its products') sweet spot is analytics, as the underlying database for applications leverage large volumes of data to support decision-making, drive customer/user experience and IoT (Internet of Things) related applications. The reason we differentiate its sweet spot is that while the product offers capabilities to address a broad range of database use cases, to compete effectively in many of those markets (e.g. transactional databases), MongoDB would (as we wrote last year): · Need better and more functionalities; · Expand the developer ecosystem. Many of these markets are presently dominated by vendors with very powerful capabilities and changing databases is expensive and time-consuming.

This past year the company executed well and this past quarter, they deliver another strong quarter exceeding even our prior optimistic expectations. Overall, with the broader software space struggling with growth stagnation, MDB's stock should continue to benefit from its accelerating growth trajectory. In the near-term, the stock should continue to benefit from: 1) Revival in IaaS/PaaS consumption growth; 2) Increased focus on Enterprise customer; 3) continued strength in new customer addition; and 4) an easing interest rate environment. We also get a sense that under new CEO and CFO, MDB is striving to invigorate growth effort and improve financial visibility to reduce stock volatility. Furthermore, MDB provided positive commentary for FY27 expectations, removing a potential near-term overhang, but upcoming FY27 guidance (in March) could still introduce some volatility.

With the valuation multiple roughly doubling since the recent lows, we think the upside will be primarily driven by healthy 20%+ (est.) top-line growth in CY26/FY27.

We launched on HubSpot in March (Link) and while we liked the business, we did not like the macro overhang, given the company's SMB exposure. We believed at the time there was some downside risk given the stock's valuation multiple and thus launched with a Market-Perform rating. In September, we upgraded the stock (upgrade note) for 4 reasons: 1. Macro issues that concerned us when we launched have abated/stabilized and the downside risks to SMB (HubSpot's core customer) is much lower. 2. The multiple has decreased making the risk / reward trade-off much more favorable. 3. AI is unlikely to be a big downside factor in the foreseeable future and is more likely to be an incremental tailwind to growth for HubSpot as we like the approach taken by management. 4. The setup for H2 is very good and using leading indicators the company is, we believe, likely to beat more than expected.

This past quarter (Link) HubSpot delivered a solid quarter and raised their FY guidance incrementally but the guidance came across as being subdued. Management continues to watch macro conditions given the fact their customers are SMB and therefore more likely to be impacted by any macro issues. Heading into last earnings, we saw two upside drivers for HubSpot: · The potential for beat and raise driving near-term upside, · Strong business fundamental and reset valuation driving long-term upside potential. Given the mixed signal from subdued guidance last quarter despite healthy business metrics, we think near-term upside got pushed out a quarter or two. We see next year (FY26) guidance in Feb as a clarifying event for the stock. Overall, we think business fundamental are intact, and HUBS is well positioned to deliver above market growth over the foreseeable time horizon. Coupled with reset valuation, HUBS provides attractive risk-reward trade-off over longer-time horizon.
