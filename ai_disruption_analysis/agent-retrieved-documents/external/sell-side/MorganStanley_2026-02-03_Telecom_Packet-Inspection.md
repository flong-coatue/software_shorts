Investor conversations have largely been focused on four common topics / themes: CSCO, GLW, AXON, optical moves/setup. See AXON moves as most in contrast to news flow, and remain committed to OW. GLW opportunity worth the most exploration. CSCO AI Summit has a great lineup, but see largely for prospective enterprise customers vs. investors. Expectations on LITE higher than previewed, though see recent 5D move as a result of ecosystem moves vs. expectations on earnings power fundamentally changing.

Investors pulling on common threads. Investors conversations over the last week have centered around 4 topics: CSCO, GLW, AXON, optical moves/setup. In terms of where we think there is the most dislocation, we think the moves in AXON have been the most outsized to their opportunity, remaining firmly OW. On CSCO, we remain OW, but note that we see the impressive AI Summit lineup tomorrow as offering little in the way of new financials and being geared more towards enterprise customers. Corning's META announcement has triggered lots of conversations about TAM, a topic worth doing the most work on. On LITE / COHR moves, these have been the most volatile stocks YTD. Early read throughs encouraging on opportunity, though note largely built into the stocks at this point.

Impressive lineup, but not expecting any material announcements out of Cisco's AI Summit. Cisco is hosting AI Summit on Tuesday, February 3rd (today). This virtual, all-day, event offers an impressive lineup of speakers (Jensen Huang, Sam Altman, Chief Technologist for AI Infrastructure at Google, CTO at Microsoft, just to name a few). While having so many presumed customers / partners speaking at the event is a strong validation of Cisco's presence in the AI market, we largely see this event as geared towards enterprise customers vs. investors. Cisco's enterprise business is the vast majority of their business, validating that customers should continue to use Cisco for their AI needs is a key towards continued growth. We see it as a positive for sentiment, but are not expecting updated financial disclosures from this event (particularly with earnings next week).

Increased adoption of body cameras by federal workers positive for AXON; recent selloff lacks real news catalyst. News reports Monday AMC indicated that body cameras will be deployed to federal agents in Minneapolis and the body camera program is expected to expand nationwide when funding is available. Increased adoption of body cameras is an encouraging demand driver for AXON, as Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

META announcement has driven most conversations around sizing of hyperscale opportunity around GLW. Ahead of Q4 earnings last week, Corning announced the $6bn long term supply agreement with META. They also noted on their subsequent earnings call the next day that they were working on multiple long term supply agreements with hyperscaler customers (as they try to determine how much capacity to invest in). While we noted on earnings that $5 earnings number investors have been floating for 2028 needs more than the META deal alone, it is a name where doing more work on the opportunity is warranted.

LITE / COHR daily volatility brings questions into earnings this week. While the last week has seen a strong reversion (LITE up ~25% / COHR up ~10% in L5D), investors had been questioning the volatility and slight selloff in optical componentry stocks year to date. We see the latest moves as a fear of being short AI names given results over the last week vs. true changes in earnings power expectations. In terms of our previews on LITE and COHR, we received little pushback on COHR, but did get pushback that expectations on LITE upside to EPS was bigger than we had laid out given expectations around EML / telco price increases (with gross margin expectations of at least 40%). We would note that read throughs like FN Monday evening were supportive of strong demand trends within the space, though would note capacity constraints remain across the space. M M
