China (PRC) | Alternative Energy

We have received many questions from clients in the past weeks over CATL's weak share price performance, down 15% ytd (vs down ~5% for SZCOMP). We address these questions in the note after our face-to-face catchup with mgmt. Reiterate BUY, our conviction pick for China industrials in 2026.

Market concerns of margin pressure overdone. CATL has a 1-month pass-through mechanism for EV-related batteries, contracts they signed post 2021. Not only will CATL not be impacted by upstream prices, they may even benefit as 1) battery price hikes typically enhance unit gross profit, 2) CATL has access to much more offtake and control of upstream materials so it will have a wider cost advantage over peers and even benefit from their equity stakes in upstream, eg, we estimate its 25% equity stake in CMOC could net CATL RMB7-8bn in profits in 2026. But ESS is more project based, with no pass-through mechanism, and ST rise in upstream prices could pressure margins. Projects in China from bidding to installation is very short cycle (1-2 months) giving CATL the flexibility to adjust pricing.

Return to market share gains in 2026. According to CABIA, CATL lost 1.7ppt of EV batteries m/ s in China in 2025. However, that was due to capacity bottlenecks which CATL has addressed with 50% capex growth planned for 2026 or c.400GWH of new capacity. Reinforcing this is the growth in battery swap stations which would take CATL's PV (chocolate) battery swap stations to 3k and Qiji HDT swap stations to 1k in China, which would allow CATL to tap into 600k vehicles. Feedback on its Aion UT super battery swap car has been positive.

CATL is also an AIDC and ESS meme. With flows chasing meme stocks and sectors related to AI, we also see CATL as the stock to play on this theme. CATL expects ESS demand to grow at least 50% yoy in 2026, taking its overall exposure to c.25% from 20% in 2025. In the US, it expects ESS demand to be flattish yoy even with OBBA in place with a dropoff from grid ESS to be made up by growth from AIDC ESS demand. On HVDC batteries, CATL views these as one of the few that can produce specialized high voltage batteries that have different shapes and sizes from traditional ESS batteries putting them ahead of the competition when the market is expected to transition into HVDC by 2027/28.

Lithium price not a concern. On Lithium prices, CATL views the LT price of Lithium to be at RMB70-90k/t as there is abundant supply of lithium resources in China. On its Jiangxi mine restart, CATL highlighted that licensing procedures are now complete and it is eager to restart the mine when the administrative approvals are done.

Sodium Battery making progress. CATL continues to be excited about the progress of sodium batteries in turn reinforcing a negative medium-term view of lithium. On Jan 22, CATL launched Tianheng 2, a battery with fast charge (4C 18 mins charge 60%), long-range (800km) for light logistics trucks that can withstand -40 degrees. In the low temperature version, energy density can reach 175Wh/kg while in the long distance version combined with NCM/LFP freevoy battery, energy density can reach 200Wh/kg. At 175 Wh/kg, energy density is now on par with LFP while the cost is similar to LFP at c.RMB100k/t. In mid-2026, more sodium batteries will be launched with PV. By 2027, CATL is confident that cost of sodium batteries will be lower than that of LFP given economies of scale.

EV slowdown not a huge concern. While the market may be concerned about a China EV slowdown post the subsidy and VAT roll-back, CATL is maintaining its 20% EV battery growth target for 2026 in view of 1) Market transition into larger battery packs, 2) solid growth in EU of 20%+, and 3) strength in HDT batteries.

Jefferies Franchise Picks include stock selections from among the best stock ideas from our equity analysts over a 12 month period. Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a 15% stop loss, and the remainder will have a 20% stop. Franchise Picks are not intended to represent a recommended portfolio of stocks and is not sector based, but we may note where we believe a Pick falls within an investment style such as growth or value.
