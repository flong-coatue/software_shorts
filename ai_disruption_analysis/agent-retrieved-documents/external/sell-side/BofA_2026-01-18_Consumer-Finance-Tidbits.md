Price objective basis & risk Affirm Holdings (AFRM) We calculate our price objective of $97 USD based on an 15x C2026E EV/Revenue less transaction expense. A 15x multiple is above the long-term average (12x), which we view as warranted given sustained growth and margin trajectory. A 15x multiple is also a premium to the broader BNPL peer group due to higher growth, better monetization, and high profile partners. Downside risks to our PO: 1) increased regulation in the BNPL space, 2) increased credit costs, 3) take rate compression from increased competition, 4) weaker eCom growth. Upside risks to our PO 1) quicker than expected rate cuts, 2) increased merchant penetration, 3) quicker adoption and more frequent usage of BNPL products by consumers, and 4) acceptance of BNPL / Affirm in newer verticals / geographies. American Express Company (AXP)

Our price objective of $420 is based on a 21x multiple to our 2027 EPS forecast. A 21x PE multiple is broadly in line with the market, which we think is appropriate given AXP's historic valuation and our increased confidence in the defensibility of earnings. Downside risks to our PO are weaker-than-expected macroeconomic conditions, softer consumer and business spending, weaker loan growth, increasing competition, weaker US consumer credit performance, disruptions in capital markets, or an increasing regulatory burden. Block Inc (XYZ) Our price objective of $86 is based on 20x 2027E adjusted EPS, including SBC. Our target multiple is in-line with the comp group as faster EPS growth is balanced by growing lending business.

Upside risks to our price objective are 1) better-than-expected overall macro conditions for small / medium sized businesses driving higher gross profit growth, 2) achievement of "Rule of 40" (GP growth + adj. operating income margin) quicker than '26, 3) better-than-expected margins, 4) market perception of XYZ as a terminal value stock. Downside risks to our price objective are 1) increased competition from a wider group of companies as XYZ moves upmarket and international, and intensifying competition in Cash App, 2) overall macro conditions for small/medium-sized businesses, and 3) lack of diversification for Cash App revenue/gross profit streams. Bread Financial Holdings Inc (BFH) Our $88 PO is based on an 7.5x multiple to 2027e earnings. A 7.5x PE multiple is on the lower end the typical range for card issuers and consumer finance companies (6-11x), given macro and consumer fears, but reflects improving credit outlook.

Downside risks to our price objective are an economic downturn, which could lead to elevated loan loss rates, increased defaults, higher credit costs and slower loan growth. Deteriorating economic conditions would likely hurt investor sentiment and drive valuations lower. Loss of retail partners also poses a risk to growth and the earnings outlook. Regulatory rules could also impact earnings and growth potential. Capital One Financial (COF) Our $294 PO is based on an 11x PE multiple to our 2027 EPS forecast. An 11x PE multiple is towards the higher end of the historic range (7-12x), which we think is appropriate given expected synergy realization, optimistic credit outlook, buyback potential, and resilient cardholder base. Downside risks are slower-than-expected revolving credit growth, faltering economic recovery and rising loan losses, which could drive earnings below our estimates, and result in valuation compression. Cybersecurity and regulations are also risks. Corpay Inc (CPAY)

We calculate our price objective of $342 based on a 14x multiple to our 2026 non-GAAP EPS estimate. Our PE multiple is approximately a 30% discount to the S&P, reflecting CPAY's exposure to fuel prices and weak sentiment as investors fear the long-term impact from stablecoins on the business. Downside risks to our price objective are 1) weakening macro environment reduces demand for trucking/fuel, 2) increased competition, and 3) large fluctuations in fuel prices/foreign exchanges rates. Enact Holdings (ACT) Our $41 PO is based on a 50/50 blend of a 9x PE multiple to our 2026 EPS forecast and 1.1x BVPS. A 9x PE multiple within the historical range for mortgage insurers (6x-11x) and reflects the current favorable backdrop for housing credit, as well as, ACT's strong book value growth, and the more resilient business model.

Downside risks to our price objective are an economic downturn, which could lead to elevated defaults on mortgages and fewer mortgage originations, increased competitive pressures and price competition from private and / or government competitors. Changes to the regulatory environment could also impact future returns. Genworth's large concentrated ownership stake limits float and could be a risk. Essent Group (ESNT) Our $66 PO is based on a 50/50 blend of a 9x PE multiple to our 2026 EPS forecast and 1.1x BVPS. A 9x PE is within the recent range for mortgage insurers (6-11x forward PE) and reflects ESNTs cost discipline, lower tax rate, strong capital position, and the favorable housing backdrop. Downside risks to our price objective are an economic downturn, which could lead to elevated defaults on mortgages and fewer mortgage originations, increased competitive pressures and price competition from private and / or government competitors. Changes to the regulatory environment could also impact future returns. Successful M&A integration could also be a risk. Klarna Group PLC (KLAR)

Our $46 Price Objective is based on an 10x EV/2026E Gross Profit multiple. An 10x EV/GP multiple is a premium to global BNPL providers but in-line with Affirm, which we will be the company most investors will comp Klarna to. Relative to Affirm, Klarna has a larger network and faster GP growth, but weaker near-term monetization and profitability. Downside risks to our PO: heightened competitive intensity in the BNPL market and the loss of a major retail partner. Sensitivity to macro and consumer spending / credit trends is also a key risk. We believe Klarna is likely particularly sensitive to how middle and lower income consumer finances fare. Klarna also relies on deposit and third party funding to fund customer purchases and any disruption to this funding is a key risk. BNPL is a relatively nascent industry and has periodically attracted regulatory scrutiny which is also a risk. Mastercard Inc (MA)

We utilize a 32.5x '26E EPS to calculate our 12-month price objective of $616. Our multiple is a premium vs. the S&P500 given MA's above average earnings growth in a normalized environment, increased diversification, competitive positioning, secular tailwinds, and recession resilience. Our multiple is also slightly higher than its closest peer given MA grows faster, albeit off of a smaller base. Downside risks are 1) weak consumer spending in the event of a macroeconomic downturn, 2) increased customer concentration and consolidation, 3) legislative and regulatory changes, 4) potential litigation settlements, which could include monetary damages, and/or result in changes in business practices, 5) loss of customer contracts due to increased competition or new entrants, including local/global payment networks, new start-ups and existing large and small technology companies, and 6) large fluctuations in the value of currencies/foreign exchange rates. MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)

Our $27 PO is based on a 50/50 blend of a 9x PE multiple to our 2026 EPS forecast and 1.1x BVPS. A 9x PE multiple is within the 10yr historical range for mortgage insurers (6x-11x) and reflects the current favorable backdrop for housing credit, as well as, MTG's strong book value growth and capital return potential. Upside risks to our price objective are stronger than expected economic growth, fewer loan delinquencies and strong housing credit performance which could lead to elevated new business written and fewer mortgage defaults. Downside risks to our price objective are an economic downturn, which could lead to elevated defaults on mortgages and fewer mortgage originations, increased competitive pressures and price competition from private and / or government competitors. Changes to the regulatory environment could also impact future returns. Navient (NAVI)

Our $11 price objective is based on a 10x multiple to 2026 EPS. A 10x multiple is towards the center of trading range for Consumer Finance companies (6-12x). We view as justified given the idiosyncratic risks of the strategic action plan, offset by the upside risk of a refinance boom. Upside risks: Better-than-expected gains in "in-school" market share, higher refinance originations, slower repayment / consolidation of legacy portfolios, faster-than-expected execution of strategic actions. NMI Holdings (NMIH) Our $43 price objective is based on a 50/50 blend of a 9x P/E multiple to our 2026 EPS forecast and 1.3x BVPS. A 9x multiple is within recent trading range for MI companies (6-11x) reflecting the favorable housing credit backdrop and 1.3x BVPS is a premium to peers due to NMIH's stronger book value growth. Downside risks to our price objective are an economic downturn, a weaker housing credit backdrop, increased competitive intensity, and regulatory changes.

OneMain Holdings, Inc. (OMF) Our $75 price objective is based on an 8.5x multiple of our 2027 EPS forecast. An 8.5x multiple is within the typical range for consumer finance lenders (7-13x). We think OMF likely trades at the lower end of the range given its larger exposure to subprime borrowers. Downside risks to our price objective are deterioration in credit, execution risk on the credit card portfolio, macroeconomic risk, regulatory risk, and a dividend cut. PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Our $68 PO is based on 12x 2026E EPS. A 12x PE multiple is broadly consistent with other legacy payment and processor comps. Our multiple reflects our view that PYPL's scale and strong position in eCommerce is balanced by market share loss in its core branded checkout business.

Downside risks to our price objective are 1) macro (PYPL's business skews towards lower- to middle-income consumers' spending on more discretionary purchases, 2) execution on the ongoing strategic initiatives to improve transaction profit/unbranded margins, and 3) competition (we expect the PYPL market share debate to remain unsettled for the foreseeable future). Radian Group Inc (RDN) Our $35 PO is based on a 50/50 blend of a 9x PE multiple to our 2026 EPS forecast and 1.1x BVPS. A 9x PE multiple is within the historical range for mortgage insurance (MI) stocks (6-11x) and reflects the solid operating backdrop for mortgage insurance. Upside risks to our price objective are stronger-than-expected economic growth, fewer loan delinquencies and strong housing credit performance, which could lead to elevated new business written and fewer mortgage defaults. Execution in the non-MI businesses could also be better than forecast and lead to higher / faster profit growth.

Downside risks to our price objective are an economic downturn, which could lead to elevated defaults on mortgages and fewer mortgage originations, increased competitive pressures and price competition from private and / or government competitors. Changes to the regulatory environment could also impact future returns. Successful M&A integration could also be a risk. Rocket Companies, Inc. (RKT) Our $25 PO is based on a 19x PE multiple to our 2027 EPS forecast. A 19x PE multiple is above mortgage comps currently and the historical range for mortgage originators. We think the premium is warranted given expectations for a larger market prospectively, attractive recent acquisitions, as well as for RKT's superior technology and brand. Downside risks to our PO are: 1) lower-than-forecast origination volumes or gain-on-sale margins, 2) macroeconomic risk from a weaker-than-expected recovery or a downturn in the housing market, 3) regulatory changes, 4) execution risk, and 5) complex ownership structure and limited float.

Upside risks to our PO are: higher-than-forecast mortgage origination volumes or gain-on-sale margins, a stronger-than-expected housing market backdrop, and faster market share gains than expected. There is also risk RKT utilizes its strong balance sheet for M&A, dividends, and buybacks, which could improve sentiment and valuation for the shares. Sallie Mae (SLM) Our $35 price objective is based on a 10x multiple to our 2026 EPS forecast. An 10x P/E multiple is towards the higher end of the historical range for consumer finance peers (7- 12x). We believe this is more appropriate given improving credit quality, strong ROEs, dominant market share position and increased TAM opportunity from federal loan reform. Downside risks: Weaker consumer credit, lower gain on sale margins, regulation / political risk in student lending, higher competitive intensity, and interest rate risk SoFi Technologies Inc (SOFI)

Our $20.50 price objective is based on a 22x multiple to 2027e EPS. A 22x multiple is above most peers (20x) which we believe is warranted given stronger EPS growth, somewhat balanced by consumer credit cyclicality. Upside risks: Renewal / new wins of key partners on favorable terms, resilient consumer credit metrics, increased visibility on loan sales, balance sheet-light growth. Downside risks: deterioration in lending environment appetite, execution risk, macroeconomic risk, and regulatory risk. Synchrony Financial (SYF) Our $96 PO is based on a 9.5x P/E multiple on 2027E EPS. Our multiple is in the middle of the typical trading range for SYF (6-12x), which we think is appropriate given the macro uncertainty and lower consumer confidence, partially offset by idiosyncratic credit underwriting tightness.

Downside risks to our price objective are an economic downturn, which could lead to elevated loan loss rates, increased defaults, higher credit costs and slower loan growth. Deteriorating economic conditions would likely hurt investor sentiment and drive valuations lower. Loss of retail partners also poses a risk to growth and earnings outlook. Regulatory rules could also impact earnings and growth potential. Upside risks are consumer balance sheets continue to hold strength and credit metrics remain strong. Increased visibility in peak loss rates shifts investor sentiment. Federal reserve achieves a soft landing. There is potential for outsized capital return. Upstart (UPST) Our $71 price objective is based on 31x 2026e adjusted EPS, a premium to comps (18.5x), given UPST's faster growth outlook. We also view UPST's large total addressable market and product expansion potential favorably.

Downside risks are 1) A recession could lead to weaker credit performance on UPST loans, impacting funding and fair value of loans, 2) UPST AI models are relatively untested in a challenging macro backdrop and could underperform expectations, 3) competition from other fintechs and established companies, 4) credit market disruptions could impact demand for and valuation of UPST loans. Upside risks are 1) revenue constraints as a result of macro and loan demand may improve faster than expected, 2) the artificial intelligence (AI) used by the company may differentiate itself from FinTech's and large financial institutions, 3) product expansion drive higher profitability sooner than anticipated, 4) a better interest rate and macro backdrop, 5) potential short squeeze risk. Visa Inc. (V) We use a 29x on C26E EPS (non-GAAP) to calculate our 12-month price objective of $382. Our multiple is a premium to the S&P 500, which we view as justified given Visa's growth profile, increased diversification, execution track record, and large addressable market opportunity.

Downside risks are 1) weak consumer spending in the event of a macroeconomic downturn, 2) increased customer concentration and consolidation, 3) legislative and regulatory changes, 4) potential litigation settlements, which could include monetary damages, and/or result in changes in business practices, 5) loss of customer contracts due to increased competition or new entrants, including local/global payment networks, new start-ups and existing large and small technology companies, and 6) large fluctuations in the value of currencies/foreign exchange rates. WEX Inc. (WEX) We calculate our price objective of $182 based on 10x our 2026E non-GAAP EPS estimate. Our PE multiple is a meaningful discount to the S&P and WEX's closest peer, which we view as warranted given higher fuel exposure, lower long-term growth algorithm, and near-term challenges in the corporate payments business.

Downside risks to our price objective are 1) weakening macro environment reduces demand for trucking/fuel, 2) increased competition, 3) large fluctuations in fuel prices/foreign exchanges rates, 4) travel volumes remain muted.

Consumer Finance 10% cap generates a myriad of reactions President Trump ' s (proposed?) 10% credit card interest rate cap was the talk of the town this week as we kicked off 4Q earnings. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon would not quantify the potential impacts but highlighted than profit margins in the sector are already thin and this policy would drastically limit access to credit and harm the American economy . These sentiments were echoed on the earnings calls of other large cap banks and at Delta Airlines (DAL), who partners with American Express to offer Delta cards. CEO Ed Bastian said DAL wouldn ' t be able to begin to contemplate how the cap would be implemented. All for n a ught: National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said in an interview on Friday that " it won ' t necessarily require legislation " and banks will voluntarily provide new " Trump cards " to consumers. This is being interpreted as the administration walking back the proposal and taking tail risk off the table. Building the mosaic: Recent sector news TPG agrees to buy $2.4B of consumer loans from OMF : TPG signed a forward flow agreement to purchase

$2.4B of One Main ' s (OMF) consumer loans on an ongoing basis through June 2028 , in addition to a previously agreed upon $1.3B. Our take: This agreement demonstrates that private credit demand for consumer loans remains high . TPG will purchase $100M/month for the first 18 months and then ratchet down to $50M/month (vs. $75M for the current agreement). KLA R launches P2P Europe : Klarna (KLAR) has launched a peer-to-peer (P2P) payments service in 13 European countries, comparable to Zelle, embedded in the Klarna app. It is not currently clear whether the service will be expanded to the US in the future. Our take: This is a solid move on Klarna ' s part to increase engagement and move further towards being an everyday app. If the company launched the product in the US, It would increase competition for XYZ (which operates Cash App) and PYPL / Venmo. Copilot x PYPL : PayPal (PYPL

) will power merchant inventory surfacing, branded checkout, guest checkout and credit card payments within Copilot.com for Copilot ' s new Copilot C heckout program. The program lets users shop and checkout within Copilot.com. Our take: This is the latest in a string of AI related partnerships and should be a positive for the business, albeit modest until we see stronger consumer adoption. AFRM tests BNPL for rent: Per press reports, AFRM will soon begin offering BNPL for rent through a partnership with Esusu. Our take: while the headline will likely generate negative initial reactions, we think timing rent with pay cycles may offer an interesting opportunity for incremental volumes, user growth, and user data. Management changes at NAVI: Navient (NAVI) appointed Steve Hauber (who previously served as Chief Administrative Officer and has been with the company for 10+ years) as Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Current CFO Joe Fisher will leave during 1Q26. The company also created a new dedicated CFO role for its Earnest business, which it is currently looking to fill.
