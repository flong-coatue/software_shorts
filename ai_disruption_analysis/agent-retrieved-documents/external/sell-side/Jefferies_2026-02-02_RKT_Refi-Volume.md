Rocket is positioned to avoid the earnings outcome seen at PFSI in 4Q25 and should convert a refi pickup into net revenue and share gains. Higher recapture and stronger GOS economics mean that, even with some DTC margin pressure, refi activity should be additive on a net revenue basis (see Exhibit 1). Recent share price pressure reflects peer extrapolation and near-term earnings optics, not a breakdown in RKT's underlying economics.

Under conservative assumptions, Rocket's refi math remains favorable. Even assuming a stressed recapture rate of 55% (versus blended RKT/COOP day one of ~60%) and a stressed blended GOS margin of 260bps (vs 280bp in 3Q25), effective GOS captured is 143bps of UPB. Against a blended RKT/COOP MSR cap rate of 140bps, refi activity remains net positive to revenue on a portfolio basis. At a 16% CPR on RKT's consolidated $1.4B servicing portfolio, each 10bps of net UPB impact equates to $56M of annualized revenue.

Refi outcomes are determined by recapture and relative margins, not rate direction. A refi eliminates the existing MSR and only creates replacement economics if the borrower is retained, making recapture the critical variable. Rocket's structurally higher recapture rate materially reduces the share of prepays that represent permanent MSR losses and directly links servicing runoff to new originations. This linkage differentiates Rocket from platforms with lower recapture and weaker production offsets.

The central risk is sustained margin compression, not the durability of recapture. Maintaining elevated recapture in a competitive environment can require pricing concessions, and we expect some DTC margin compression in refi-heavy quarters (especially early in the cycle when originators have built excess capacity). That said, the economics weaken meaningfully only if margins compress and remain below 250bps on a sustained basis or if recapture rates fall below ~50% for RKT. Absent those conditions, RKT's model continues to generate positive refi economics. Implications for 4Q25 results. A late-quarter refi pickup could pressure reported margins and introduce quarterly volatility if Rocket prioritizes retention. However, unlike peers, for Rocket, a significant portion of refi activity should translate into retained customers, incremental revenue, and market share. We view recent stock weakness as driven by earnings-optics risk and peer extrapolation, and believe that near-term franchise concerns appear overstated.

Rocket Companies is a Detroit-based fintech platform focused on homeownership and consumer finance. The core business spans: (i) home search and real estate services via Redfin's listing portal, brokerage, and agent network, (ii) mortgage origination across DTC, partner and broker channels, primarily under the Rocket Mortgage brand, (iii) mortgage servicing via the combined Rocket and Mr Cooper platform, and (iv) ancillary services including title, closing, and personal finance products. Our $25 PT is based on 20x 2027E EPS. Risks include integration with COOP/RDFN, lower origination volumes (particularly refinance volumes) and further contraction of GOS margins (particularly in the partner channel).

Our $130 PT represents a 9x multiple on 2027E EPS. Primary risks include margin compression, elevated MSR repayments, volumes, and competition.

Jefferies' methodology for assigning ratings may include the following: market capitalization, maturity, growth/value, volatility and expected total return over the next 12 months. The price targets are based on several methodologies, which may include, but are not restricted to, analyses of market risk, growth rate, revenue stream, discounted cash flow (DCF), EBITDA, EPS, cash flow (CF), free cash flow (FCF), EV/EBITDA, P/E, PE/growth, P/CF, P/FCF, premium (discount)/average group EV/EBITDA, premium (discount)/average group P/E, sum of the parts, net asset value, dividend returns, and return on equity (ROE) over the next 12 months.

Jefferies Franchise Picks include stock selections from among the best stock ideas from our equity analysts over a 12 month period. Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a 15% stop loss, and the remainder will have a 20% stop. Franchise Picks are not intended to represent a recommended portfolio of stocks and is not sector based, but we may note where we believe a Pick falls within an investment style such as growth or value.
