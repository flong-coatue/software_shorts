Addressing a selection of key investor questions related to FY 2026 : While the main near-term question is the recent news of Trump suggesting a 10% interest rate cap on credit cards (we address this separately with initial thoughts via our report "Why 10% credit card interest rate caps are unlikely, and what the knee-jerk reaction may be"), this report aims to answer some of the additional and most common questions we receive on Visa's FY 2026 opportunity, including a selection of topics spanning Value-Added Services (VAS) contributions to net revenue growth, US inbound cross-border travel, pricing measures (particularly in FY 2H), FX volatility, and more. In summary, we see the potential for Visa's net revenue growth to slightly accelerate (vs. ~11.5% organic FXN in FY 2025) in FY 2026 (absent any potential disruption from Trump's proposed

10% interest rate cap on credit cards), even without the support of OBBBA-related spending benefits. Further, Visa's guidance has already digested an elevated operating expense guide and a higher tax rate, with the potential for estimate revisions to be driven by topline upside. While both Visa & Mastercard remain top picks and many of the topics here are broadly applicable to both companies, this report focuses specifically on Visa.

Ample reasons to believe in stable to potentially accelerating net revenue growth in FY 2026: We believe Visa's growth will be supported by: 1) continued VAS contributions (~27% of net revenue as of FY 2025, compounding in the low 20%s, or ~600bps contribution to revenue growth); 2) relative improvement in inbound US travel from easier comps and a degree of support from the soccer world cup; 3) pricing initiatives (particularly in Europe, which are FY 2H weighted); and 4) continued strong Visa Direct contributions (with a now larger base, albeit with growth potentially slowing in FY 2H). Alongside these tailwinds, we expect one mild offset to be the

recent reduction in FX volatility, with the CVIX down ~MSD% since Visa provided its initial FY 2026 guidance. Additionally, we model incentives as a percentage of total payments volume to continue to increase by ~0.67bps to ~11.76bps of volume, driving ~16% growth in incentives with roughly ~20% of total payment volumes to be impacted by client renewals (similar to the ~20% in FY 2025). Value-Added Services as a now larger & faster growth business, resulting in greater net revenue growth contributions vs. recent past: As recently as FY 2023, Visa's VAS made up ~22% of net revenue and was growing in the high-teens (adding ~400bps to revenue growth). Today, the business is both larger and faster growth.

Specifically, Visa's VAS is approaching ~30% of net revenue and has been growing in the mid 20%s, which equates to a ~600bps contribution to revenue growth. For context, while Mastercard continues to see a larger contribution to net revenue growth from its VAS&S business, the contribution has been relatively more stable over the past few years (i.e., ~37% of net revenue in FY 2023 growing ~16%, or contributing ~600bps to net revenue growth, with the business now approaching ~40% of net revenue and growing ~18%, or contributing ~700bps). Said differently, the growth contribution gap has gone from ~200bps to ~100bps over the past few years. Additionally, we expect a degree of incremental VAS attach (marketing related services) for events including the 2026 soccer world cup and the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan.

Value-in-Kind Incentives (VIK) : Additionally, while a small percentage of total VAS contributions, growth is at least somewhat supported by value-in-kind (VIK) incentives. These are incentives paid in the form of "vouchers", that function effectively as "store credit" for Visa clients, which they can use to pay for Visa services, including VAS. When VIK is included in a contract, Visa recognizes these incentives (amongst other things) as Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), the majority of which relates to VAS that has not yet been recognized as revenue (as RPO related to payments network services are not included). In FY 2025, Visa had ~$4.9b in remaining performance obligations (noting they expect ~50% of this figure to be recognized primarily as VAS revenue in the next two years), up ~20% YoY, a contributing leading indicator for continued VAS experimentation and usage.

US inbound rebound a mild positive to FY 2026 net revenue growth: We estimate that cross-border excluding Intra-Europe makes up ~40% of Visa's net revenue, with travel making up ~60% of this business (the other ~40% is eCommerce, remittance, marketplace payouts, etc.). Despite being one of the smaller segments as measured by cross-border inbound travel volume (making up ~19% [derived here] of total crossborder ex Intra-Europe travel volume), US inbound travel is the highest yielding crossborder travel corridor for Visa. As to FY 2025 trends, based on UN tourism data we estimate US inbound volume was only up ~3%, while for FY 2026 we expect US inbound growth to return to the ~LDD level. Our ~LDD growth assumption accounts for FQ1 2026 US government international tourist visitation data and assumes the remainder of the year is similar to total company cross-border excluding Intra-Europe travel growth levels of ~12% in FY 2025 (simple average of quarterly growth rates) but below

FY 2024 US inbound receipts growth of ~16% based on UN tourism data. Additionally, our FY 2026 growth estimate accounts for incremental US inbound travel from the soccer world cup contributing ~2% of additional growth. We estimate the ~8% delta in US inbound travel growth this year vs. last year to be a ~40bps benefit to total company net revenue.

Pricing expected to be FY 2H weighted once again: While changes to Visa's pricing schedule are constantly being made (upwards, downwards, fee consolidation, etc.), we note Visa stands to benefit from several pricing actions that are in place for FY 2026. This follows what was characterized as a similarly 2H weighted pricing year in FY 2025, actions which will continue to benefit 1H FY 2026. Specifically, we note the following European price increases effective April 1, 2026: 1) Visa Token Facilitation Fee (F2F) increases of 1bp (from no fee previously) for domestic transactions and 5bps (from no fee previously) for cross-border transactions; and 2) Visa Token Facilitation Fee (CNP) increases of 5bps (from no fee previously) for domestic

transactions and 8bps (from no fee previously) for cross-border transactions. Including the impact of the Visa Secure Credential Framework in Europe that went into effect on October 1, 2025 (5bps increase from 2.5bps to 7.5bps designed to encourage 3DS or token usage), we estimate the annualized impact, all else equal, of these price increases to be a ~2% benefit to Visa's total company net revenue. Importantly, this analysis is done only to give directional sizing context, and not to suggest in-year incremental revenue growth contributions (given the timing of such increases, lapping of prior pricing actions, additional changes and/or offsets/reductions, etc.).

Commercial Enhanced Data Program (CEDP): In April 2025, Visa put the Commercial Enhanced Data Program (CEDP) in place, replacing the previous Level 2 and Level 3 incentive programs. This program introduces a 5bps network fee per transaction when the CEDP flag is present. We believe that certain MCCs (e.g., restaurants, airlines, lodging) do not appear to qualify for L2/L3 incentive programs, which limits the portion of US B2B volumes that are potentially applicable to the 5pbs fee. The program comes

with a reduced interchange opportunity meant to incent the submission of more organized data for B2B spend (Product 3 data [prior Level 3]). Additionally, we note that within CEDP there is a new verified and non-verified status (verified merchants are those that have submitted at least 90% of transactions in a 30-day period with complete and accurate data), with both being subject to the 5bps CEDP participation fee, but with verified merchants receiving the interchange reduction (with non-verified merchants able to receive a credit back if the data eventually passes validation). We estimate the annualized impact, all else equal, of the CEDP price increases to be a ~50bps benefit to Visa's total company net revenue. Similar to above, this analysis is done only to give directional sizing context, and not to suggest in-year incremental revenue growth contributions (given the timing of such increases, lapping of prior pricing actions, additional changes and/or offsets/reductions, etc.).

Digital Commerce Service Fees (DCSF): Effective April 1, 2026, Visa will implement US Digital Commerce Services Fee (DCSF) increases of 0.75bps (from 0.75bps to 1.5bps) for domestic transactions and 3.5bps for cross-border transactions. These fees are scheduled to further increase to 2.25bps for domestic transactions and 5.25bps for cross-border transactions as of April 1, 2027. Importantly, this increase is not purely incremental given the April 1, 2026 increase will also include the bundling of additional services. For these additional services, Visa will stop charging for them individually (e.g., Token Authentication Verification Value [TAVV], Visa Account Updater [VAU/RT-VAU], Visa Digital Credential Updater [VDCU], Visa Credential Enrichment Service [VCES]). We believe that a subset of

merchants that rely heavily on VAU to prevent declines could see cost savings from this bundling of services (moving from a high per-event fee to a low basis-point ad-valorem fee [1.5bps]). However, for most merchants (who infrequently deal with credential updates and associated fees) and especially for merchants with higher CNP mix, this price increase could be more meaningful, particularly in FY 2027.

Additional pricing change highlights for FY 2025 and FY 2026: In addition to the pricing changes outlined above, we highlight a number of changes throughout other regions which could prove to be mildly supportive of Visa's net revenue growth. Examples of these include: 1) Non-Domestic Settlement Currency Volume Fees increasing 5bps (from 10bps to 15bps) on April 1, 2026, with further increases announced for April 1, 2027 and April 1, 2028; 2) Visa E-Commerce Token Facilitation Fee of 5bps per authorization (cap $1.25) for Group A (domestic/intra-EEA and UK/CH corridors) and 8bps per authorization (cap $2.00) for Group B (TR/IL/Europe cross-border and rest-of-world to Europe corridors) on April 1, 2026 (up from €0.02 currently);

and 3) Visa Digital Commerce Service Fee in Asia Pacific added more services to the bundle (e.g., TAVV, Token Life-cycle Management [TLCM], Visa Card Enrollment Hub [VCEH], Card-on-File Data API [Cof-D API]) and a fee change to 2bps for domestic transactions and 5bps for cross-border transactions (from 0.75bps for both domestic and cross border previously), going into effect April 1, 2026.

Visa Direct continues to contribute ~100-200bps to total payments volume growth: Given reporting differences in how Visa & Mastercard account for these volumes (Visa including both Account Funding Transactions [AFT] & Original Credit Transaction [OCT], while Mastercard includes only account funding portion), we focus our sizing analysis on Visa Direct. We anchor our analysis around various transaction count and growth disclosures, third-party data sources, yield disclosures (~9-10 cents per transaction), and industry discussions to build an illustrative framework to illustratively size (within ranges) Visa Direct's volume and net revenue contributions. In summary, we believe Visa Direct now accounts for ~8-9% of Visa's payments volume (FY 2025 UBSe), and has been contributing ~100-200bps to the payments volume growth algorithm (with the largest portion of these volumes recorded within debit, specifically card not present debit).

Incentives: Incentives are arrangements that Visa has with their partners in the payment ecosystem (i.e., issuers, acquirers, and merchants) that provides those partners with payments, services, or other incentives for them to help drive growth in payment volume in general (the bigger the partners, the higher the concession from Visa). Incentives are largely tied to payments/purchase volume and typically have performance and milestone components to them, which are accounted for as a contra-revenue. Since 2017, incentives as a percentage of volume have steadily increased by an average of ~0.45-0.50bps of volume (excluding outliers of 0.82/1.09bps increases in 2022/2023, respectively, which we outline in our Visa & Mastercard "Demystifying the Models: A

Modeling Reference"). In 2026, Visa expects ~20% of payments volume to be impacted by renewals (implying incentive growth generally similar to 2025 with Q3 having the toughest comp). We expect incentives to grow ~16% YoY to ~11.76bps of volume (up ~0.67bps from ~11.08bps of volume in FY 2025). FX volatility as an offset: Higher FX volatility results in wider FX spreads, while lower FX volatility results in lower FX spreads. Cross-border excluding Intra-Europe volume drives ~40% of net revenue for Visa. Within this revenue stream, we estimate that ~1520% comes from revenue earned on FX spreads.

This suggests that roughly a ~MSD portion (or potentially slighty higher) of Visa's net revenue is via FX spread. Directionally, this would suggest that a ~10% move in the FX volatility (with CVIX as the most commonly used measure) results in a ~60bps impact to revenue earned from FX spreads. As to this year's impact, holding today's CVIX levels constant throughout the remainder of FY 2026, we expect the FX volatility to be down ~19% YoY, which would suggest a ~100bps headwind to FY 2026 net revenue growth. For added context, since Visa's FQ4 earnings late October, the CVIX has moved from ~6.9 to ~6.6, a ~4% decrease, which would suggest a roughly ~25bps incremental headwind to net revenue growth, all else equal.

Valuation: At the current valuation of ~1.15x S&P (vs. 3Y avg ~1.27x) and ~25.9x NTM EPS (vs. 3Y avg NTM EPS multiple of ~26.1x), we believe Visa is currently trading at an attractive level.

Figure 1: We expect VAS to contribute ~600bps of net revenue growth in FY 2026 (vs ~400bps in FY2023) Source: Company data, UBS estimates Source: Company data, UBS estimates

Visa breaks VAS into four categories (Issuing Solutions, Acceptance Solutions, Risk and Security Solutions, and Advisory and Other Services), with each category contributing over ~$1b in revenue while growing double digits. Overall VAS growth is tied to transaction volumes, though we note certain categories benefit from different transaction types. For more information on VAS for Visa & Mastercard, see our deep dive here.

 Issuing Solutions (the largest category, contributing ~$3.5b of annual revenue and growing in the mid-teens on a 3-year CAGR basis from 2022-2024) is driven by growth in Visa processed transactions, with Cardholder Engagement solutions (i.e., benefits including airport lounge access, dining reservations, shopping experiences, etc.) being the largest revenue contributor.  Acceptance Solutions (second largest category, contributing ~$2.5b of annual revenue and growing in the low-teens on a 3-year CAGR basis from 2022-2024) is driven by growth in network transactions (i.e., both Visa and non-Visa processed transactions) with network products (i.e., solutions like account verification that are designed to enhance Visa transactions for sellers and acquirers) being the largest revenue contributor.

 Risk and Security Solutions (third largest category, contributing ~$1.5b of annual revenue and growing in the low-20%s on a 3-year CAGR basis from 20222024) is also driven by growth in network transactions, with transaction transaction risk solutions (e.g., Visa Advanced Authorization transaction scores, Visa Risk Manager) being the largest revenue contributor.  Advisory and Other Services category (the smallest category, contributing ~ $1.3b of annual revenue and growing in the mid-30%s on a 3-year CAGR basis from 2022-2024), is driven by engagement (as Marketing Services is the largest revenue contributor).

higher yields: Visa Mastercard have spent ample time and resources building a crossborder network that boasts scale, trust, convenience, and governance which has led to an efficient and differentiated offering that is supportive of company yields. Specifically, Visa

Mastercard's scale is an important factor that sets them apart, as Visa partners with ~14.5k financial institutions globally, having over 4.7b payment credentials available to be used at over 150mm acceptance locations worldwide (as of September 30, 2024), while Mastercard partners with ~22k financial institutions globally, having over 3.5b payment credentials to be used at ~150mm acceptance locations worldwide (as of December 31, 2024). In addition to the global network strength, cross-border transactions also tend to be more defensible against factors such as nationalism or domestic regulations. In this report, we provide an overview of the mechanics of crossborder transactions, historic cross-border volume growth, and mix on a sub-segment level basis (travel, eCommerce, remittances, payouts, other addressable payments), alongside revenue mix and yield estimates.

Visa Mastercard's US Adjusted Volume spread vs. Addressable PCE analysis: This analysis serves as a follow-up to our previously published US Carded PCE Penetration Analysis report, which was done on an annual basis and provided additional context around the broader cash-to-card topic. As part of this report, we update the annual analysis and provide a quarterly view into trends. For additional context, with the more recent slowing of Visa Mastercard's US volume growth (~5-7% growth) and optically lackluster incremental consumer carded PCE penetration, investors are becoming more focused on the spread between Visa Mastercard's US volume growth relative to US PCE. We believe it is important to adjust both the numerator and denominator to remove new flows such as commercial/B2B and Visa Direct/Mastercard Send (which make up approaching ~20% of Visa Mastercard reported volumes). In doing so, our analysis suggests that Visa

Mastercard's Adjusted US volumes (excluding commercial/B2B and Visa Direct/Mastercard Send) are no longer outgrowing addressable PCE by ~2-6% as they were pre-COVID (2017-2019), as the delta has been flattish to slightly negative over the last ten quarters but slightly improving compared to 2022 levels (with Visa being relatively flat vs. PCE in Q1 and ~2% below in Q2 of 2024, while Mastercard maintained a ~2% positive delta in Q1 2024 and Q2 2024, partially benefiting from the Citizens Bank debit portfolio conversion. When looking at reported US volumes for Visa Mastercard (i.e., not removing new flows), the spread vs. addressable PCE has been more positive (~1% above addressable PCE on average for both Visa Mastercard over the past ten quarters). See full report here.

Visa Mastercard as high-quality compounders: As part of this report, we analyze the medium-term growth algorithms for Visa Mastercard from both a volume (PCE + cash-to-card-conversion + new flows + other Mastercard specific opportunities) and yield (value added services, cross-border, pricing and other mix-related, rebates incentives) perspective. We include additional detail around growth yield components (e.g., Visa Direct volume yield impacts, pricing

mix considerations, Maestro conversions, etc.). The report also serves as a primer on many aspects of the card network's business models. Our conclusion is an expectation for ~8-9% compounding medium-term revenue growth for Visa and ~10% for Mastercard (rough mid-points within wider ranges provided in this report). We continue to believe that the card networks have many attractive qualities as durable high-quality compounders, including their balanced exposure (discretionary vs. non-discretionary, goods vs. services, online vs. in-store), ability to grow through moderate recessionary conditions (expense flexibility), profitability (~55-70% EBIT margins, high FCF conversion), high-quality EPS figures (GAAP-like and unburdened by substantial SBC), and expansion into new flows (notably via Visa Direct Mastercard Send, expanding the TAM beyond PCE-related flows). Our analysis and historical data are available in Excel by request. See full report here.

Analyzing the cash to card conversion opportunity remaining in the US: Given the more recent slowing of Visa and Mastercard's US volume growth (~MSD%) and optically lackluster incremental consumer carded PCE penetration, investors are becoming more focused on what the contribution from cash-to-card conversion can continue to add to the card networks US growth algorithm going forward and what the considerations are for the remaining categories and cash usage left to convert. Further, this analysis serves as a follow up to our recent Visa Mastercard growth algorithm deep

dive report. Our analysis suggests that US consumer carded volume penetration of addressable PCE (~60% of total PCE, UBSe) has reached ~85%. While we expect carded penetration levels to continue to increase (due to factors such as demographic trends, declining unbanked population, growth of eCommerce, etc.), we expect US cash to card conversion to be a smaller contributor to the card networks total volume growth algorithm (i.e, 00bps benefit to growth on top of real PCE growth, inflation, and new flows contributions). For balance, we continue to believe that a larger cash-to-card conversion opportunity remains outside the US. Further, both Visa and Mastercard have expanded into non-PCE carded volumes (new flows such as B2B and Visa Direct Mastercard Send-related volumes), which could push total network volumes

above 100% of addressable PCE over time. Our analysis in this report focuses on the consumer carded volumes (i.e., reported volumes less new flows [B2B, Visa Direct, Mastercard Send]). See full report here.

Increasing importance of value-added services (VAS) for Visa & Mastercard: As a result of investor concerns over more mature cash to card trends in certain developed markets, combined with a more recent re-acceleration of value-added services-related net revenue growth, this component for both networks (VAS for Visa, VAS&S for Mastercard) has come into greater focus. These services now represent ~24% and ~38% of net revenue for Visa Mastercard, respectively, contributing roughly half of total net revenue growth (i.e., ~500-550bps contribution). We also note that each company has placed an added emphasis on their value-added services businesses recently, with both appointing a senior executive over the last two years to oversee their value-added services businesses. Above and beyond the direct contributions, the card networks see several indirect benefits associated with value-added services, including: 1) helping their clients grow profits

payments volume while using these services; 2) deepening relationships with customers; 3) capturing new sources of revenue to complement payments and money movement; and 4) attracting new talent. Over the medium-term, we expect value-added services in our base case to contribute ~3-5% and ~5-6% to Visa Mastercard's net revenue growth, respectively (or ~35-45% and ~50-60% of total net revenue growth, respectively). Additionally, as part of our illustrative base case, we expect value-added services to increase in mix, approaching ~30% and ~45% of net revenue by 2028 for Visa and Mastercard, respectively.

Visa & Mastercard modeling reference: This report serves as a Visa Mastercard modeling reference and highlights various differences across the two companies' reporting structures. We include descriptions of the various revenue ( incentive) and expense lines, differences for each line between Visa Mastercard, historical context, income statement geography (e.g., location of value-added services [VAS]), and a framework for modeling considerations across each line. This report is part of our ongoing deep-dive series on Visa Mastercard, and follows reports related to: 1) the medium-term growth algorithms (from both a volume [PCE + cash-to-card conversion + new flows] and yield [value added services, cross-border, pricing mix, and rebates incentives] perspective); 2) cash-to-card conversion analysis in the US, focused on addressable PCE (both annually and quarterly); 3) a framework for analyzing valueadded services (transaction and non-transaction-based components across both networks); and 4) A2A considerations.

Visa Inc. (Visa), incorporated in May 2007, is a global payment technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks, and governments in more than 200 countries and territories, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. The company's core business is focused on C2B payments, although it also offers exposure to B2B and additional non-PCE payment flow, alongside faster-growth, value-added services business.

Visa: 1) Macro-related, in particular as it relates to consumer spending (credit business more exposure to consumer discretionary trends); 2) Regulatory, although at times more related to interchange-related caps (fees earned by bank issuers vs. network fees earned by the card networks); 3) Cross-border (travel & eCommerce) trends given outsized yields vs. domestic transactions; 4) M&A integration and execution, given a track record of bolt-on acquisition (capability and/or service additions); and 5) FX-related, both in the form of transaction (given meaningful international exposure) and exposure to volatility (elevated FX spreads earned during periods of higher currency volatility). We value Visa on Price to earnings.

Mastercard: Risks to our investment thesis: 1) Macro-related, in particular as it relates to consumer spending (credit business more exposure to consumer discretionary trends); 2) Regulatory, although at times more related to interchange-related caps (fees earned by bank issuers vs. network fees earned by the card networks); 3) Cross-border (travel & eCommerce) trends given outsized yields vs. domestic transactions; 4) M&A integration and execution, given a track record of bolt-on acquisition (capability and/or service additions); and 5) FXrelated, both in the form of transaction (given meaningful international exposure) and exposure to volatility (elevated FX spreads earned during periods of higher currency volatility). Our valuation methodology is based on price to earnings.
