We recently circled up with management teams on January quarter-end before companies entered their quiet period, continuing our 'Into the Silence' series. We highlight the most important takeaways below, with greater detail on the following pages:

■ CrowdStrike views its Next-Gen SIEM offering as a stronger growth vector with differentiated capabilities following the Onum acquisition. The ability for AWS customers to access CrowdStrike's SIEM natively, with 10GBs of free data-ingest introduces a potential tailwind. ■ GitLab recently announced General Availability of the Duo Agent Platform. Mr. Padisetty was appointed Chief Technology Officer, and he was selected for his background with Hyperscalers and working on global deployments, in addition to his strong understanding of Hybrid delivery models (SaaS & Self-Managed). ■ MongoDB go-to-market changes should be more incremental, compared to prior years, (1) with further sales organization investment deepening coverage in existing geographies (e.g. Japan) or verticals (e.g. Public Sector); and (2) increased focus on Enterprise-to-Enterprise strategic engagements through CEO CJ Desai's focus on customers, as opposed to traditional workload-specific selling.

■ Palo Alto Networks expects to drive significant improvement to Chronosphere's Margin profile, benefiting from the company's position as a leading consumer of Google Cloud as an example. The company is still deciding how to categorize CyberArk Maintenance ARR ($183 Million or 13.6% of Total CyberArk ARR in the most recent quarter) post-close. Additionally, Hardware is roughly 10% of Total Revenue, where memory and storage costs are ~10% of the Hardware BOM. ■ SentinelOne Net-New ARR contribution is ~50/50 between New Logos versus Existing Customers, (1) demonstrating the large market opportunity and traction behind new product avenues in Data and AI; while also (2) explaining potential for quarterly variability due to the heavier lift in acquiring New Logos. Multi-product attach is benefiting the model, as New Logos take more product upfront. Separately, integration timelines for Observo and Prompt Security are viewed as relatively light.

■ Snowflake's acquisition of Observe has an estimated ~$650 Million purchase price and expected to bring roughly 170 employees to the company, where our conversations indicate a $40 Million to $50 Million ARR run-rate. Beyond core Data Warehousing market strength, Snowflake is recognizing the collective contribution to Revenue from accelerated product velocity, alongside sales specialists for AI and Data Engineering. ■ Zscaler will continue to target markets where the company is strategically advantaged, where the SPLX acquisition adds capabilities for Security for AI (rather than Identity, for example). The CMO appointment provides an opportunity to re-think marketing across different stakeholder groups. Finally, we note that the company is selective for which customers can adopt Z-Flex, and sales reps do not have assigned Z-Flex quota. Please see our recent Needham Growth Conference Takeaways ( here ) and Okta ( here ) notes for additional fiscal quarter-end data points following our management conversations. January 21, 2026

We provide updates as companies under coverage with fiscal-end quarters enter quiet period.

CrowdStrike continues to see competitive wins in SIEM, where the biggest source of legacy and incumbent displacements is derived from Splunk and QRadar, as well as other vendors such as SumoLogic. If full takeouts are less realistic in the near-term, CrowdStrike leverages Onum for routing data to multiple destinations at once, which CrowdStrike believes is a unique capability. Management views CrowdStrike's capabilities as superior, based on the ability to detect data in the pipeline and avoid double-paying for ingest - particularly since ~85% of Log files in the SIEM are generated by Endpoints. On the go-to-market front, we view CrowdStrike's AWS partnership that was announced in December as a potential tailwind, since AWS customers have access to CrowdStrike's SIEM natively, with 10GBs of free data-ingest, before entering a Pay-as-you-Go model.

CrowdStrike disclosed on the 3QFY26 earnings call that accounts with Falcon Flex represented $1.35 Billion in ending ARR, growing north of 200% yr-yr. Customer cohort data is still early, making broader generalizations about contract timing or duration less conclusive at this time. However, customer feedback remains positive, as evidenced by over 200 Re-Flex customers in 3QFY26. We note every customer who took CCP had to move to Flex, where CCP's impact to the model will have a long-tail based on varying contract lengths of 1-3 years. Management did not offer any commentary on possible budget flush for 4QFY26, but highlighted CrowdStrike's record pipeline exiting 3QFY26.

ServiceNow and CrowdStrike have worked together as partners over multiple years, and CrowdStrike does not anticipate a significant change to ServiceNow's competitive behavior following the recent acquisitions of Veza and Armis. As a reference point, Veza and Armis rarely came up in CrowdStrike's competitive discussions, leading the company to view ServiceNow's acquisitions as neither a tailwind, nor a headwind. CrowdStrike's acquisition of SGNL brings the company further into Identity, where the integration timeline is projected in the ~3-6 months range (versus ~3 months for Pangea and ~12 months for Preempt Security).

On January 9th, GitLab announced the hiring of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Sivaprasad Padisetty and reiterated 4QFY26 & FY26 guidance in conjunction with the press release. Furthermore, the company announced last week that Duo Agent Platform is Generally Available (GA), helping quell investor concerns that CTO turnover would result in product delays. Mr. Padisetty was previously the CTO at New Relic, where he overlapped with Chief Executive Officer Bill Staples. The choice of Mr. Padisetty as CTO is twofold based on: (1) his background with Hyperscalers for global deployments; and (2) his strong understanding of Hybrid delivery models (SaaS & Self-Managed).

The mid-January CTO announcement followed the appointment of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Jessica Ross in December (effective January 15, 2026), as well as the September hiring of both Chief Product & Marketing Officer (CPMO) Manav Khurana and Chief Information Officer (CIO) Manu Narayan. Management acknowledged GitLab's elevated executive turnover is above the broader Software landscape, and the company is accounting for additional execution risk with guidance. The company believes most, if not all, of the executive suite is in place, noting that certain positions were net-new roles (e.g. CIO).

GitLab has internal assumptions for SaaS Revenue growth when crafting guidance, but does not incentivize the field to prioritize SaaS versus Self-Managed. Regulated industries have a need for Self-Managed deployments, which GitLab views as an under-served market opportunity that carries significant Gross Margin. As a result, GitLab does not see a need to start pushing the business towards SaaS. - ■ SaaS Revenue increased by 35.5% yr-yr to $76.9 Million in 3QFY26 and represented 31.5% of Total Revenue.

Persistent softness was seen in the SMB segment during 3QFY26 as the demand environment holds constant, and management does not expect a material change. Customers spending at $15,000 and below demonstrates greater price-sensitivity. However, SMB contributes just 8% to Total ARR. The company is experimenting with bundling and sales efforts tailored to SMBs, but noted the greater focus on the remaining Enterprise & Commercial business (92% of Total ARR) given healthy NRR and LTV/CAC. Up-market growth is expected to offset SMB softness, and GitLab's Total Addressable Market (TAM) continues to expand as automated code development tools increase the amount of code in need of review and support. Separately, Public Sector softness from the U.S. Government shutdown disproportionately impacted License Revenue in 3QFY26. Management noted the company is making progress and conversations remain ongoing, although the expiration of Continuing Resolution on January 30th introduces uncertainty.

On the 3QFY26 earnings call, management noted that some hiring slipped into 4QFY26 and FY27, with future headcount additions spanning the Engineering, Marketing, and Direct Sales functions. The order of department additions was intentional, as MongoDB leans most-heavily into Engineering, followed by Developer awareness, and select quota-carrying reps. For the sales organization, management discussed certain areas of interest such as deepening coverage in geographies (e.g. Japan) or vertical-specific investing (e.g. Public Sector). After several years of more significant go-to-market changes, MongoDB expects smaller changes in FY27 - continuing to incentivize ARR through strategic new workload acquisition and consumption growth. The sales organization has driven more consistent results and improved usage behavior in recent quarters.

Newly-appointed President & Chief Executive Officer CJ Desai has a "maniacal focus" on customers that he is taking to the next level by leveraging his rolodex to stimulate more Enterprise-to-Enterprise strategic engagements. Historically, MongoDB's go-to-market motion has operated on a workload-by-workload basis, and Mr. Desai sees an opportunity to drive broader adoption with a C-suite push. ■ Example: The company recently met with a large London bank that has 300 of 900 total applications on MongoDB, and plans to transition ~600 to Public Cloud in CY26. The conversation centered on how to move 50% of these workloads onto MongoDB, which would double the current volume of applications. ■ Point #1. CEO CJ Desai has a "maniacal focus" on customers, where we believe his C-suite engagement will translate into broader Enterprise adoption of MongoDB over time (as opposed to the company's traditional cadence of winning on a workload by workload basis).

Enterprise AI-readiness remains steady, where many proofs of concept (POCs) are being tested although few have moved to production. Management is confident the transition will occur at some point, but Enterprises are still building confidence as they navigate a lack of technical abilities, fear of hallucinations, security concerns, and questions on ROI. Momentum has been more encouraging with AINative customers, which are expected to progress more quickly , but are not yet contributing meaningfully to Revenue.

The company has generated some early customer wins with the newly announced AI-powered Application Modernization Platform (AMP), but the initiative remains in its nascence and heavily tied to Professional Services and Lower Margins. As a result, MongoDB is selectively choosing which customers to engage for AMP, while the company invests to further productize the offering (e.g. code rewrite automation). Deals are predominantly internally-sourced today, and sales efforts are more passive.

On December 12th, an internal team identified a security vulnerability, patched the issue, and published the findings, which were subsequently covered by the press. Informally referred to as "MongoBleed," the vulnerability was not a security breach, but mismatched length fields in Zlib compressed protocol headers that enabled potential memory reads by unauthenticated clients. Management is not aware of any customers who were impacted, and thus far, customers have generally been appreciative of MongoDB's response. - ■ Point #1. We view MongoBleed as having a de minimis impact on MongoDB's financial results, particularly as the security vulnerability was identified by MongoDB's ongoing internal security initiatives.

Based on client conversations, dominant questions regarding the Chronosphere acquisition include: (1) customer concentration risk; (2) customer quality beyond Top Accounts; and (3) the speed of converting Existing Customer relationships into Revenue post-close. While Chronosphere's $160 Million-plus in ARR has significant exposure to 2 leading frontier model vendors, the concentration story is softened by other 8-figure ARR customers in the Financial Services and Food/Grocery sectors, as examples. Palo Alto Networks has already established a target list of 173 Enterprise organizations, where it intends to cross-sell Chronosphere. Management expects existing Palo Alto Networks relationships can significantly compress Chronosphere's vendor approval timelines and sales cycles.

■ Point #1. Following our call, we expect Chronosphere to be embedded within Cortex over time. ■ Point #2. Palo Alto Networks will drive significant improvement to Chronosphere's Margin profile, partly based on economies of scale. For example, Palo Alto Networks is a Top 5 or Top 10 consumer of Google Cloud, where the company expects to negotiate more favorable terms on behalf of Chronosphere.

Palo Alto Networks previously guided to ~37% Free Cash Flow Margin in FY26 following the close of both the CyberArk and Chronosphere acquisitions - roughly 150 basis points lower than the standalone company guidance range of 38%-39%. Operating Margin guidance was not given at the time, but the company expects a similar spread versus initial guidance for 29.5%-30.0% - implying a range of ~28.0%-28.5% assuming the same 150 basis points delta.

Acquisition approvals are moving along and continue to track to close during 3QFY26. Management is still evaluating if Palo Alto Networks' Next-Generation Security (NGS) ARR will include the entirety of CyberArk's ARR following the acquisition, since CyberArk's ARR base includes both Subscription and Maintenance. - ■ Point #1. We believe the current evaluation of whether CyberArk's Maintenance ARR is categorized within Palo Alto Networks' NGS ARR demonstrates Maintenance ARR is not a factor in the company's ability to achieve the $20 Billion NGS ARR target in FY30. (For reference, Maintenance ARR contributed 13.6% - or $183 Million - of CyberArk's Total ARR in 3QCY25.)

We discussed how the AI infrastructure build-out is creating global shortages, leading to spiking components costs like memory which is spilling over into hardware. Management did not comment on potential headwinds to the model, but noted roughly 10% of Total Revenue is from Hardware, where ~10% of Hardware's Bill of Materials (BOM) relates to memory and storage costs.

SentinelOne's Net-New ARR growth is split ~50/50 between New Logos versus Existing Customers, which makes the company fairly unique in our coverage where Net-New ARR contribution skews materially higher for Existing Customers. We believe New Logos' contribution to SentinelOne's Net-New ARR demonstrate (1) the large market opportunity the company is addressing; and (2) more consistent execution and innovation resonating with prospective customers, while highlighting (3) potential variability due to the larger effort and less predictable timing for acquiring New Logos. - ■ Point #1. Multi-product attach is benefiting the model, as New Logos are taking more product upfront, and Average Deal Sizes are larger on a yr-yr basis.

Capabilities from the Observo and Prompt Security acquisitions will be sold as both a standalone product, as well as part of a broader package. For example, Observo can be tied into AI SIEM and XDR as a full suite. SentinelOne is leveraging acquired Sales & Marketing teams to continue building pipeline, with the intention of eventually removing sales overlay teams in the medium-/long-run. As SentinelOne continues to position itself as an AI & Data Security Platform vendor, the company is seeing increasing interest and engagement from customers - especially from organizations looking to deploy GenAI technologies where trust and accountability are paramount. Management specified it has greater optimism for the Prompt Security acquisition than at the time of acquisition, based on customer feedback, traction and signals from the broader market. Integrations for both Observo and Prompt Security are viewed as relatively light.

Snowflake is very familiar with Observe, where (1) the company was built on the Snowflake platform and (2) Snowflake's previous CEO and current Board member Mike Speiser also serves as a Board member for Observe, Inc. The company believes Observe excels in root-cause analytics targeting massive Logs ingestion for complex analytical querying use-cases (i.e. distinct from the core market opportunity for Datadog). Management views Observe as a strategic fit, given the number of customers that were asking to run Observe next to Snowflake; where a combined offering simplifies customers' stack. Our conversations indicate purchase price of approximately $650 Million, bringing roughly 170 Employees to Snowflake where run-rate ARR is in the $40 Million to $50 Million vicinity.

Management has attributed Revenue strength in recent quarters to core Data Warehousing, where Cloud Migrations still remain early. As an example, there remains a significant delta between spend from landed Global 2000 organizations and Snowflake's Top 25 accounts. Furthermore, Data Engineering continues to outpace Total Revenue growth, albeit off a smaller base. The company highlighted Revenue growth in recent quarters is a reflection of accelerated product velocity, where the aggregate contribution of newly-released capabilities serves as an important source of future growth. Additionally, the go-to-market organization continues to utilize sales specialists such as Sales Engineers for AI and for Data Engineering.

Within Zscaler's AI segment, management distinguishes between (1) Security for AI (e.g. protecting AI usage, models, and data) and (2) Security using AI (e.g. Agentic Ops), where the AI-SOC is described as separate from offerings designed to secure AI usage. In November, Zscaler announced the SPLX acquisition which is framed as fitting into Lane 1 (i.e. Security for AI), covering things like (1) GenAI & DLP controls; (2) AI asset visibility; and (3) policy enforcement for prompts and inputs. Additionally, SPLX brings Red teaming capabilities as part of testing and hardening AI usage pathways. - ■ Point #1. Management has consistently messaged that the Zscaler strategy will focus on areas where the company has an edge, and is positioned to win in Data and AI. As a result, we do not expect Zscaler to make a larger push into the Identity market.

On Janaury 5th, Zscaler announced Sunil Frida as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), where his fresh set of eyes provides an opportunity to re-think go-to-market across different stakeholder groups by making the company's Zero Trust offering more consumable, rather than being framed as a single technical narrative specific to Security practitioners. We see this as a positive development as Zscaler's complex innovation and value creation can be difficult to translate to a broader audience of both prospective customers and investors.

Zscaler's Z-Flex vehicle is a sales tool to reduce friction in the procurement process, while encouraging larger, longer-term deals. Our call discussed the company's selectivity in terms of which customers discuss Z-Flex, where the model is in its earlier stages before management broadly operationalizes Z-Flex selling via assigned quota.

■ Valuation: □ Market corrections typically hit higher-valuation names harder than the overall market. □ Risk-off conditions could result in a lowering of higher-valuation names even without a correction. □ CrowdStrike could report results disappointing expectations and see a sharp valuation correction. □ CrowdStrike's growth could decelerate, changing perceptions and lowering the valuation. ■ Sensor Update Debacle Could Cost More, Disrupt Longer, and Inhibit Future Business. The scope of the disruption of the CrowdStrike sensor update has been larger than any prior event. There are a wide range of potential outcomes. There are a number of unknowns on how it will be handled, how compensation will play out, and what liabilities Crowd will incur. Further, customer and potential new customer behavior is likely to change but to what degree is hard to estimate.

■ Breaches: As a Security company, CrowdStrike is reliant on its reputation. A high visibility breach of CrowdStrike's customer or customers would undermine its reputation and hurt perceptions of the technology. ■ Economic Contraction: We think CrowdStrike and Security is broadly more insulated than other areas of Technology and the broader market, but there is a risk. ■ Cloud Outages: CrowdStrike is dependent on a reliable internet and is particular dependent on cloud infrastructure at AWS. Outages could cause customers to slow their subscriptions.

■ Stock market corrections typically hit higher valuation stocks harder than the overall market. ■ Risk-off sentiment could drive higher-valuation companies' stocks lower, even without a broader market correction. ■ GitLab could report quarterly results or provide guidance which falls below expectations, resulting in compression of the valuation multiple. ■ Important investor metrics for GitLab could falter such as Revenue growth, RPO, or Dollar-Based Net Retention, any of which would likely weigh on investor sentiment and the valuation multiple assigned to shares of the company. Competition: GitLab faces intense competition from a number of established and emerging companies, including (1) established providers such as Atlassian and Microsoft; (2) companies offering hosting and code collaboration services; and (3) file storage and distribution services providers.

Unique Operating Risks Created by the Remote-Only Company Structure. By nature of all employees being fully remote, GitLab is dependent on technology, thus IT complications could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of operations. In addition, it may be difficult to develop and preserve corporate culture and team members may find few opportunities to collaborate in meaningful ways. Any impediments to preserving corporate culture and fostering collaboration could harm future success, including the ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively, and execute on business strategy.

Dual Class Voting Structure Concentrates Voting Control. GitLab's capital structure features a ten-to-one voting ratio between the Class B and Class A common shares. As a result, Class B shareholders (including directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of GitLab common stock) hold the substantial majority of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock. This limits and potentially precludes investors' abilities to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction. Ability to Manage and Sustain High Revenue Growth. In our experience, most high-growth software companies have difficulty maintaining sustained, multi-year periods of high revenue growth. Historically, software companies experience growth that declines exponentially initially, but very modestly subsequently (i.e. growth is logarithmic).

Rapidly Evolving Infrastructure Software Market Could Drive Confusion. The proliferation of comparable software features or tools by numerous vendors has traditionally created confusion in the marketplace. Customers typically pause to evaluate new technologies or slow purchasing cycles to allow the industry to standardize on a single architecture. We believe this dynamic could be heightened with GitLab due to the number of vendors operating in the self-managed software and SaaS deployment spaces. Macro Investor Sentiment Around High Growth Software. A negative external macroeconomic shock or sudden change in investor sentiment towards high-growth technology stocks could lead to significant downside price volatility. Economic Contraction: In the event of an economic downturn, we recognize the risk to market demand and pricing pressure to shares of GitLab and the broader equity markets.

■ Stock market corrections typically hit higher valuation stocks harder than the overall market. ■ Risk-off sentiment could drive higher-valuation companies' stocks lower, even without a broader market correction. ■ MongoDB could report quarterly results or provide guidance which falls below expectations, resulting in compression of the valuation multiple. ■ Important investor metrics for MongoDB could falter such as Revenue growth, Atlas Revenue growth, or Customer growth, any of which would likely weigh on investor sentiment and the valuation multiple assigned to shares.

■ MongoDB faces intense competition from a number of established and emerging companies: 1. Established Legacy Database software providers such as IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle; and 2. Public Cloud providers including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Sales Cycles Can Be Long and Unpredictable: According to MongoDB's 10-K filing, the duration of an average sales cycle is three to nine months, and has the potential to increase depending on the size of the deal. This is mainly driven by customer initiatives and time may be taken to evaluate, test, and qualify each product offering. Dependent on One Platform. Growth is dependent on the success of the MongoDB database platform. The penetration of this platform may saturate, customers may struggle with its implementation, or competitive factors may hinder adoption.

Ability to Manage and Sustain High Revenue Growth. In our experience, most high-growth software companies have difficulty maintaining sustained, multi-year periods of high revenue growth. Historically, software companies experience growth that declines exponentially initially, but very modestly subsequently (i.e. growth is logarithmic). Rapidly Evolving Infrastructure Software Market Could Drive Confusion. The proliferation of comparable software features or tools by numerous vendors has traditionally created confusion in the marketplace. Customers typically pause to evaluate new technologies or slow purchasing cycles to allow the industry to standardize on a single architecture. We believe this dynamic could be heightened with MongoDB due to the number of vendors operating in the self-managed software and SaaS deployment spaces. Macro Investor Sentiment Around High Growth Software. A negative external macroeconomic shock or sudden change in investor sentiment towards high-growth technology stocks could lead to significant downside price volatility.

Economic Contraction. In the event of an economic downturn, we recognize the risk to market demand and pricing pressure to shares of MongoDB and the broader equity markets.

Competition. PANW's platform is extensive and as a result the company competes with a host of legacy and emerging Security providers. We think this competitive ecosystem is intensifying as the company enters new segments and focuses more on securing cloud environments. The Cybersecurity industry is notoriously innovative and highly competitive, and best-of-breed products with advanced technology will likely remain a threat to platform plays into the future, we think, which could hurt Palo Alto's value proposition. M&A Risk. Aggressive M&A activity is part of the company's growth plan. This has in the past, and could in the future introduce integration risk, and pressures free cash flow growth.

Hardware, IT Spending, and Macro Risks. PANW has become a software company but is still exposed to the growth trajectory of network hardware equipment and the attached software sales they layer in. Following sharp IT spending growth during COVID and as we enter a murky budget environment, slow-downs in IT spending could negatively impact PANW's performance. There is also risk that core products become less relevant or accepted by customers as more Enterprises transform their digital footprints. Changes to Sales Dynamics and Incentives. The company plans to introduce many new products and alter its GTM accordingly to more aggressively sell new Cloud products to existing customers. There is a risk that the new products are not widely accepted. Dependence on Concentrated Set of Channel Partners. Palo Alto depends heavily on a handful of partners and distributors. Three distributors individually account for >10% of Revenue and collectively comprise ~50% of Total Revenue.

Pricing and Credit Risk. As PANW enters more markets, nascent competitors may be able to create and serve superior products at a lower cost. This could trigger large price cuts or even free, or nearly free, distribution of Prisma Cloud in order to win customers. Separately, PANW is becoming more reliable on the credit quality of their customers as it grows the size of PANFS (Palo Alto Networks Financial Services) to ease customer challenges with short-term cash flow given the recent rise in rates. Network Breaches/Product Failure. Any breach to PANW's network or widespread failure of their products would negatively impact the stock. PANW's firewalls. PANW's hardware and NG firewalls have had vulnerabilities critical vulnerabilities requiring patches in the past, with ~200 CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures), which compares to >500 at FTNT.

■ Valuation: □ Market corrections typically hit higher-valuation names harder than the overall market. □ Risk Off conditions could result in a lowering of higher-valuation names even without a correction. □ SentinelOne could report results disappointing expectations and see a sharp valuation correction. □ SentinelOne's growth could decelerate, changing perceptions and lowering the valuation. ■ Macroeconomic Headwinds . SentinelOne's valuation is heavily reliant on growth. Additional macro headwinds or a prolonged recession could hamper the company's ability to land new customers, increase customer spend, and achieve economies of scale.

■ Competition: CrowdStrike is a formidable foe, but we think there's room for both companies to be successful, given the vast amount of legacy displacement that is likely to occur in the Endpoint space over the coming years. As it stands, the two companies combine for 20%-25% of the estimated $10-$20+ Billion Endpoint market, while Microsoft comprises another 20-25%. Competing with CrowdStrike and Microsoft remains a risk to future growth as these companies are investing aggressively in overlapping security markets. ■ Breaches: As a Security company, SentinelOne is reliant on its reputation. A major high-visibility breach of SentinelOne or its customers could undermine its reputation and hurt perceptions of the company's technology. ■ Execution Stumbles Could Persist and Remain a Headwind to Investor Perception. ■ Significant Reliance on Channel Partners: SentinelOne has deep partnerships with many leading ISVs, MSPs and IR firms that resell its solutions. The company leans heavily on these partners for prospect access and fulfillment, which could present a risk.

■ Price Pressure: We think SentinelOne's pricing is likely to be stable as it is selling substantial value, is low-cost to deploy and has a relatively low TCO. However, competitors could try to undercut on price or re-price solutions more strategically to stem share loss. We think the product will continue to sell on performance, not on price. But it does represent a risk. ■ Economic Contraction: We think SentinelOne and Security at large are more insulated than other areas of Technology and the broader market, but there is a risk. ■ Cloud Outages: SentinelOne is dependent on a reliable internet and is particularly dependent on Amazon Web Services, where SentinelOne's platform is hosted. Outages could cause customers to slow their subscriptions or churn altogether.

■ Stock market corrections typically hit higher-valuation stocks harder than the overall market. ■ Risk-off sentiment could drive higher-valuation companies' stocks lower, even without a broader market correction. ■ Snowflake could report quarterly results or provide guidance which falls below expectations, resulting in compression of the valuation multiple. ■ Important investor metrics for Snowflake could falter such as Revenue Growth, Net Revenue Retention, or Global 2000 Customer Count, any of which would likely weigh on investor sentiment and the valuation multiple assigned to shares.

■ As competitors progress on their Cloud roadmaps, Snowflake's competitive advantage of being one of the first data warehouses to utilize the public cloud may decrease as other companies develop their own sources of differentiation. ■ Snowflake faces intense competition from a number of established and emerging companies, including: 1. Large, well-established, public cloud providers that Snowflake generally competes with, including AWS, Azure, and GCP; 2. Less-established Public and Private cloud companies with products that compete in similar markets; 3. Other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings; and 4. New or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies. Challenges Associated With Migrating Legacy Data Warehouses to the Cloud. Legacy vendors have the advantage of favorable 'lockin' derived from opportunity-cost and technical hurdles to migrate existing On-Premise data warehouses to the Cloud. Customers that only transfer a portion of their data to the Cloud may experience friction from Snowflake's lack of true hybrid functionality.

Ability to Manage and Sustain High Revenue Growth. In our experience, most high-growth software companies have difficulty maintaining sustained, multi-year periods of high revenue growth. Historically, software companies experience growth that declines exponentially initially, but very modestly subsequently (i.e. growth is logarithmic). Consumption Model Introduces More Volatility Than a Subscription Model. Snowflake's Revenue model is influenced by customers' consumption of Compute, Storage and Data Transfer Resources, each of which is subject to seasonal patterns and budget behavior. We believe the Consumption element introduces more volatility to Snowflake's business model in comparison to a traditional Subscription model, based on management's reduced visibility into the timing of Revenue Recognition.

Rapidly Evolving Infrastructure Software Market Could Drive C onfusion. The proliferation of comparable software features or tools by numerous vendors has traditionally created confusion in the marketplace. Customers typically pause to evaluate new technologies or slow purchasing cycles to allow the industry to standardize on a single architecture. We believe this dynamic could be heightened with Snowflake due to the number of vendors that offer a monitoring and analytics solution. Macro Investor Sentiment Around High Growth Software. A negative external macroeconomic shock or sudden change in investor sentiment towards high-growth technology stocks could lead to significant downside price volatility. The Market has Shifted to an Increased Focus on Profitability. In the current economic environment investors are prioritizing companies that deliver balanced Growth & Profitability, and while Snowflake has showcased incredible rates of growth, they have experienced GAAP net losses in each period since inception. Margins are trending in the right direction, but the lack of Profitability potentially adds downward pressure on the stock.

Economic Contraction: In the event of an economic downturn, we recognize the risk to market demand and pricing pressure for Snowflake's shares and the broader equity markets.

- ■ Valuation Risk: Zscaler is only beginning to become profitable and has yet to reach its long-term Operating Margin target. As a result, we use an EV/Sales calculation for valuation. While Zscaler is growing faster than most of the other Security names, it will need many years of growth, Operating leverage and careful cash management to justify its valuation on an EV/E basis. If Zscaler slows or does not produce improved Operating leverage it could see a meaningful contraction in its valuation.

■ Zscaler Requires Strong Growth to Leverage Its Operations: Zscaler needs to produce significant growth to leverage its operations. The market for Zscaler's cloud platform is rapidly evolving and cloud, let alone cloud security solutions, have not yet reached widespread adoption. Zscaler expects to grow OpEx at a healthy rate to invest resources in driving growth. Operating expenses are expected to increase significantly over the next several years as Zscaler drives growth and continues to hire additional personnel, particularly in Sales and Marketing. Zscaler expects to expand operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, and continue to develop its cloud platform and service offerings. ■ Cloud Platform Adoption is Critical to Future Growth and Profitability: If organizations do not adopt Zscaler's cloud platform, its ability to grow the business, leverage Operating Expenses, and meet estimates could be impaired. Cloud technologies are still evolving, and it is difficult to predict customer demand and adoption rates for Zscaler's solutions or cloud-based offerings generally.

■ Intense Competition in a Fragmented Market: Currently, we do not see a competitor with the breadth and scope of security offered by Zscaler's integrated Zero Trust services, though Cloudflare is fast on their heels. There is also increased competition from the large Cloud Security players as they move more of their security to the cloud and add features. We think companies like Cisco, Palo Alto and Fortinet have significant resources and customer bases and could become competitors. In addition, other smaller companies could emerge. The market for network security solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and improvements to existing products and services. Zscaler's business model of delivering security through the cloud rather than legacy on-premise appliances is still relatively new and has not yet gained widespread market traction.
