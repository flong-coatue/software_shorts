| EPS ($)**            | 2.85    |     4.14 |     5.76 |     6.85 |
| Prior EPS ($)**      | -       |     4.13 |     5.27 |     6.53 |

Our price target is based on ~30.5x our blended '26/'27 EPS of $6.58. The multiple represents a low 20s % premium to peers and mid 30s % premium to the S&P, roughly in line with current levels and the 1yr average, as we see limited appetite for multiple expansion in the market. We expect continued positive revisions, as order intake and backlog build reenfornce confidence. Sector-leading organic growth should support premium valuation.

The probabilities of our Bull, Base, and Bear case scenarios playing out were estimated with implied volatility data from the options market as of 9 Jan 2026. All figures are approximate risk-neutral probabilities of the stock reaching beyond the scenario price in either three-months' or one-years' time. View explanation of Options Probabilities methodology here

We forecast a mid-20% organic CAGR through 2027 supported by accelerating data center buildout, continued VRT share gain, and growing VRT content per MW, with continued sequential order growth building confidence. We model incrementals returning to the mid-30% range on strong volume leverage and pricing power. Our ~35x multiple represents a ~40% premium to peers, ahead of current levels, as demand tailwinds prove durable and organic growth stands at the top of the sector.

We forecast strong DD organic through 2027, as data center build cycle progresses and Vertiv continues to gain share. We model low- to mid-30% incrementals in 2026/27, recovering from a down year in 2025, as Vertiv offsets inflation and investment headwinds, returning to normalized leverage, a order and backlog growth support pricing. Our ~30.5x multiple represents a low 20s % premium to peers, in line with current levels and the 1yr avg.

As Data Center build-out gains steam & takes share of the US Industrial economy, VRT stands out as top beneficiary (~80% Data Center). With positive revisions becoming increasingly difficult to find across US Industrials, VRT offers material EPS upside w/ Data Center capex holding firm & conservative margin modeling. We expect VRT to generate organic growth ~3x our coverage avg through end of decade, providing scope for rerating. We believe VRT will sustain elevated growth above Cons and see catch-up opportunity vs Data Center construction + Hyperscaler capex through 2027.

After a mid-20s organic CAGR between 2023-25, we model 10-11% CAGR in 2026/27, as the data center build cycle peaks earlier than expected. We model modest margin expansion, with mid-20% incrementals driving margins up ~100bps cumulatively through 2026/27 amid normalizing pricing and reinvestment spend headwinds. Our ~20x multiple represents a ~20% discount to peers due to pricing concerns and capex cycle deceleration, with valuation nearing trough levels seen in early 2025. M

Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold and sell. Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone. In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice. An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations. M

Underweight (U).
