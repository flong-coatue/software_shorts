4Q results: CHRW Continues to Rise Above the Rest; PT to $205 ► We have long argued that CHRW must demonstrate resilient operating performance as spot rates begin to rise. Early brokerage results this season have shown several hundred basis points of sequential gross -margin compression, yet CHRW ' s gross margin declined only 40 bps q/q -underscoring the company ' s relative strength. CHRW remains one of the most compelling names in the industrial space in our view, supported by its scale, disciplined operating model, and expanding AI capabilities. We maintain our Buy rating and raise our target price to $205 from $160. CHRW reported 4Q25 adjusted EPS of $1.23, up 1.7% y/y and ahead of our $1.16 estimate (FactSet $1.12). While the quarter benefited from some below -the -line items, the beat was fundamentally operational. Freight activity remains soft -illustrated by the Cass Freight Shipment Index posting its 13th consecutive quarterly

y/y decline (down 7.6% in 4Q) -yet CHRW continued to gain share. NAST volumes rose 1% y/y, including 3% growth in truckload, and NAST gross margins expanded 20 bps y/y despite transportation -cost inflation in the final five weeks of the quarter. Ocean rates declined sharply y/y on reduced demand and increased capacity, in line with expectations. Even so, improved revenue -management discipline drove a 120-bps y/y increase in Global Forwarding gross margin. AI -driven automation and CHRW ' s lean operating model are increasingly visible in the results, supporting sustained share gains, disciplined pricing, a cost -of -hire advantage, and ongoing productivity improvements. As a result, 4Q adjusted operating profit of $197.5m (up 7.1% y/y) exceeded our $192.2m estimate.

► Raise target price . Our 2026 EPS estimate of $6.03 remains relatively unchanged, and we introduce a 2027 EPS estimate of $7.27. CHRW reaffirmed its 2026 operating -income target of $964m -$1.04B -raised last quarter -which aligns with roughly $6.00 in EPS. That said, implied 1Q EPS guidance screens below our forecast, driven by a sequential uptick in personnel expenses that should ease as the year progresses. For FY26, CHRW expects personnel costs of $1.25B -$1.35B and SG&A of $540m -$590m, both broadly consistent with our model. Our revised $205 price target reflects 28x our 2027E -above the long -term average -as we believe the new lean operating model and accelerating AI -driven automation warrant a higher structural multiple as they have resulted in tangible operating profit improvements.

► Total company results . CHRW delivered another resilient quarter in a soft freight environment. Total revenues decreased 6.5% to $3.92B, which was 1.6% below our estimate driven by the divestiture of the Europe Surface Transportation business, lower pricing and volume in ocean services, and lower pricing in truckload services which was partially offset by higher volume. Adjusted operating income rose 7.1% y/y to $197.5m, exceeding our $192.2m estimate, driven by disciplined cost management and continued benefits from AI -enabled automation. Adjusted gross profits decreased 4.0% to $657m (Benchmark $663m) primarily driven by lower adjusted gross profit per transaction in ocean services and the divestiture of the Europe Surface Transportation business. Despite the volume growth in Truckload, average head count was down 12.9% y/y in Q4.

► NAST results. NAST delivered another solid quarter, outperforming a soft freight backdrop and demonstrating the resilience of CHRW's core brokerage engine. Revenue of $2.8B was 3% below our estimate, driven by lower pricing in truckload services which was partially offset by higher volume. Segment volumes increased 1% y/y, with truckload up 3%, marking continued share gains despite muted industry demand. Adjusted gross profit rose 1.9% y/y, with an AGP margin of 14.6%, up 20 bps y/y and down only 40 bps q/q, an especially strong outcome given the sharp rise in transportation costs during the final five weeks of the quarter. Adjusted operating income of $150m (up 11.5% y/y) translated to a 36.4% operating margin, up 310 bps y/y underscoring continued efficiency gains and disciplined execution. NAST managed through rising spot rates with far less margin compression than the broader brokerage group, reinforcing the competitive advantages of CHRW's scale, carrier relationships, and increasingly AI

-enabled workflows. The segment exits 2025 with clear momentum and a stronger foundation for operating leverage as freight markets normalize in our view. ► Global Forwarding results . Revenue of $731m declined 17% y/y, which was slightly lower than our $736m estimate. Adjusted gross profit of $178m exceeded our $157m estimate. Gross margins expanded by 120 basis points y/y through improved revenue management discipline despite global trade headwinds. CHRW also continues to evolve the Global Forwarding business to a more cohesive, centralized model with standardized and Lean AI-enabled processes. Still adjusted operating income of $45.5m was down 17% y/y given due to a 22% decline in Ocean AGP.

Investment risks include: 1) Overall negative economic conditions could impact the transactional market more negatively than the contractual freight market which would have a negative impact on CHRW's results. 2) CHRW competes against many traditional and non-traditional logistics companies. Increased competition could negatively impact their market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates which could impact CHRW's operating profit. 3) If demand remains high and truckload capacity stays tight, spot prices will be at elevated levels. If CHRW is unable to increase pricing to their customers to more than offset the increased cost, the adjusted gross margin will remain at low levels and the P/E may not expand. 4) If third parties do not fulfill their obligations to C.H. Robinson, the company may not meet commitments made to their customers, causing them to switch to other competitors. 5) If results in Global Forwarding revert to pre-COVID levels, we see a negative $1.40-$1.50 impact to EPS which would result in negative EPS growth.

6) The company may not be able to find suitable acquisitions to enhance its growth or may acquire something that is dilutive to earnings.

CHRW's P/E and EV/EBITDA on our FY 2027 estimates are 26x and 19x respectively. Both are above the long-term average ranges. Our price target of $205 is based on a P/E of 28x our FY 2027 estimate which is above the average of 20x due to the potential for continued improvement from the new lean operating model and AI benefits offset by slowing Global Forwarding as ocean rates normalize.
