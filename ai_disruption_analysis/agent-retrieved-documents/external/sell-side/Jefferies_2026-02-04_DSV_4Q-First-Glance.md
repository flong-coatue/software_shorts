4Q EBIT is in line & the '26 guide is a miss (-4% at the midpoint). This is despite a higher than forecast synergy contribution in '26 (ie lower incremental synergies in '27-29). The guide incorporates -14% & -1% organic growth at the bottom/top end. Looking into '27/'28 organic growth would have to accelerate to 6% & 13% to see Cons unchanged. We see any consolidation in the stock today as a buying opportunity into the mid-term focused CMD on May 12th.

Outlook -4% at the midpoint. '26 EBIT guidance has been set at DKK 23-25bn vs FY25 EBIT of DKK 19,611m & with '26 Cons at DKK 25.2bn. The initial guidance is 9% below Cons at the low and +1% at the high end (-4% at the midpoint). This is despite a DKK4bn contribution from synergies vs Cons assumed DKK 3.5bn. Into '27 we see Cons incorporating +6% organic growth (using the midpoint of '26) & +13% organic growth in '28.

Jefferies' methodology for assigning ratings may include the following: market capitalization, maturity, growth/value, volatility and expected total return over the next 12 months. The price targets are based on several methodologies, which may include, but are not restricted to, analyses of market risk, growth rate, revenue stream, discounted cash flow (DCF), EBITDA, EPS, cash flow (CF), free cash flow (FCF), EV/EBITDA, P/E, PE/growth, P/CF, P/FCF, premium (discount)/average group EV/EBITDA, premium (discount)/average group P/E, sum of the parts, net asset value, dividend returns, and return on equity (ROE) over the next 12 months.

Jefferies Franchise Picks include stock selections from among the best stock ideas from our equity analysts over a 12 month period. Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a 15% stop loss, and the remainder will have a 20% stop. Franchise Picks are not intended to represent a recommended portfolio of stocks and is not sector based, but we may note where we believe a Pick falls within an investment style such as growth or value.

This report was prepared for general circulation and does not provide investment recommendations specific to individual investors. As such, the financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own investment decisions based upon their specific investment objectives and financial situation utilizing their own financial advisors as they deem necessary. Past performance of the financial instruments recommended in this report should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future results. The price, value of, and income from, any of the financial instruments mentioned in this report can rise as well as fall and may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than the investor's home currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the price of, value of, or income derived from the financial instrument described in this report. To the extent prices are shown in non-US currency, please note that our local currency price targets are based on a currency conversion using an exchange rate as of the prior trading day (unless otherwise noted). Should there be fluctuations in the exchange rate after this

date, that will affect the non-US target prices and should no longer be relied upon. In addition, investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of the underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
