Following ETN's 4Q25 earnings, although NT margin pressure emerged in Electrical Americas from inefficiencies around the capacity ramp, we were nonetheless impressed by record backlog and exceptional order strength that continues to build visibility. As such, we walked away with further conviction in our LT thesis, as we see a clear path to earnings upside from Electrification/ Aero momentum paired with support from abating capacity ramp inefficiencies and a cleaner, higher growth portfolio going forward; herein, we reiterate our OW with a $420 PT and adjust our estimates. ● Capacity Ramp Driving Inefficiencies NT; Opportunity LT: While

Electrical Americas' margins contracted modestly (~-180 bps y/y), we'd note this stemmed from now well-understood inefficiencies around the Company's capacity ramp. Of note, ETN further accelerated the ramp in 4Q, with margin pressure stemming from the costs of the ramp ultimately coming ahead of sales. Moving forward, management expects inefficiencies related to the ramp to remain a ~-130 bps headwind in 2026. With 1Q margin headwinds likely similar q/q (modeling ~-200 bps margin contraction in 1Q26), we expect ramp-related headwinds to begin to abate into 2H and set 2027 up for strong margin improvement. All in, while we understand some frustrations around margin pressure tied to the capacity build, it should be viewed in the context of what is ultimately one of the most compelling demand backdrops on our list.

● Electrical Momentum Continues to Impress: Although Electrical Americas' growth was somewhat more muted vs. our model (albeit core up ~+15%), we remain impressed by robust underlying demand (orders up >+50% y/y; DC orders up ~+200%) and backlog strength (up +$31% y/y). We get the sense this demand/backlog strength paired with capacity adds coming online provides unique visibility and ample support for the Company's initial ~+10% growth outlook, with room for upside. Additionally while Electrical growth is already impressive, we think ETN's capacity ramp should support faster order conversion and aid incremental market outgrowth vs. 2026 expectations (guide implies ~+1% outgrowth) as growth remains limited by capacity.

● Mobility Spin Is Addition by Subtraction: As was announced last week, ETN is intending to spin or sell Mobility (Vehicle/eMobility segments; ~11% and ~6% of 2025 sales and segment operating profit, respectively) into an independent publicly traded company. While initially dilutive to earnings, the move will be accretive to ETN's LT growth (~+LSD% Vehicle growth vs. ETN's LT growth of ~+6-9%) and margin profiles (~14% Mobility margins vs. total ETN of ~25%). We believe this move allows management to be more focused on the core Electrical and Aerospace growth opportunities and is particularly well-timed given the meaningful capital investments being deployed here (capacity ramp, Ultra PCS, Boyd).

Our estimates do not include the pending Boyd acquisition, which is expected close in 2Q26. We are lowering our 2026E adjusted EPS to $13.35 (from $13.45) which mostly reflects higher interest expense related to the Ultra PCS acquisition and slightly more conservative segment margin assumptions. We are also introducing our 2027E adjusted EPS estimate of $15.00.

Despite the already impressive recent growth, we feel ETN's positioning around broader Electrification and Aerospace opportunities provides considerable support for a stronger for longer growth profile. Although we see re-rating playing less of a factor given the Company's already premium valuation, we feel ETN's path to achieve upside to estimates NT and LT supports upward share momentum and outperformance over time.

At current levels, ETN shares trade at 20.7x EV/EBITDA and 27.2x P/E based on our 2026 estimates, which compare to the historical trading ranges of 14-22x EV/EBITDA and 18-28x P/E. Our $420 price target implies 23.8x EV/EBITDA and 31.5x P/E based off our 2026 estimates. Risks to ETN shares that could impede the stock from achieving our price target include:

● Deterioration in end markets. ETN's financial performance is closely tied to the demand conditions in key markets, most notably global, non-res'l construction, general industrial, truck, power quality, auto, and aerospace. A prolonged downturn in these markets could impede ETN's ability for top-line expansion. ● Management execution. Management's ability to execute its growth strategies plays a crucial role in the Company's sales performance and operational excellence. A flattening or downturn in top-line trajectory and/or the failure to meet operational results could negatively affect the share performance of ETN. ● Integration risk and importance of effective capital allocation. Any acquisition carries inherent integration risk. Given ETN's strong FCF generation, we believe investors place value on future capital allocation in the form of dividends, share repurchases, and/or M&A, the latter of which could prove elusive.
