Price objective basis & risk Rocket Companies, Inc. (RKT) Our $25 PO is based on a 19x PE multiple to our 2027 EPS forecast. A 19x PE multiple is above mortgage comps currently and the historical range for mortgage originators. We think the premium is warranted given expectations for a larger market prospectively, attractive recent acquisitions, as well as for RKT's superior technology and brand. Downside risks to our PO are: 1) lower-than-forecast origination volumes or gain-on-sale margins, 2) macroeconomic risk from a weaker-than-expected recovery or a downturn in the housing market, 3) regulatory changes, 4) execution risk, and 5) complex ownership structure and limited float.

Upside risks to our PO are: higher-than-forecast mortgage origination volumes or gain-on-sale margins, a stronger-than-expected housing market backdrop, and faster market share gains than expected. There is also risk RKT utilizes its strong balance sheet for M&A, dividends, and buybacks, which could improve sentiment and valuation for the shares.

Rocket Companies, Inc. Very strong finish to 2026 We reiterate our Buy rating on Rocket Companies (RKT) ahead of 4Q results. Industry data and company commentary suggests meaningful upside to current estimates on both mortgage origination volumes and gain on sale revenue, driving EPS upside . This update is particularly positive given RKT had previously guided to volume increases spurred by lower mortgage rates to be somewhat offset by seasonal headwinds in the fourth quarter , and a negative update from a competitor that had heightened investor concern of disappointing 4Q results (see our note : Rocket Companies, Inc.: Shares pressured by peer results 30 January 2026 ) . Reiterate Buy. CEO commentary implies 3 0%+ upside to vols/GoS Earlier, Rocket CEO appeared on CNBC messaging that 4Q volumes and gain on sale are going to be the highest they have been in four years. Commentary implies 4Q volumes are going to be greater than $ 49.6 B ( rate lock

origination volume in 1Q22) and gain on sale is going to greater than $1,484M (also 1Q22). These numbers are well above current Street estimates of $38.1B/$1,032M, implying at least 30%/ 44% upside potential . There could be some giveback from higher MSR amortization but net-net hard not to view the update as a significant positive. IMF data suggests $47B vols + modest market share gains Industry reports from Inside Mortgage Finance estimate combined Rocket/Mr. Cooper production volume at $47.2B and total f irst-Lien m ortgage o rigination market of $575B, implying RKT had 8.2% market share in 4Q25. This implies ~ 17 bps of market share gains from 3Q25 vs. pro forma Rocket/Mr. Cooper market share . Updating estimates; PO unchanged at $25 Given industry data and recent commentary, we are increasing our forecasts for 4Q origination volumes / gain on sale revenue to $4 9.0 B / $1,4 66 M ( $39.2B/

$1,186M prior ) . This drives our adjusted revenue forecast to $2, 463 M, above consensus of $2,184M and guidance of $2.1B-$2.3B, and our adjusted EPS forecast to $0.1 2 ($0.09 prior). We adjust our 2026/2027 forecasts to $0.97/$1.28 from $1.05/$1.31 prior as we update our mortgage market and RKT forward expectations. Our origination forecast is above IMF as IMF only includes first-lien while our forecast includes second lien. We mai ntain our PO unchanged at $25, still based on 19x our 2027e EPS forecast.

We rate Rocket at Buy. Rocket's technology investments should yield interesting operating leverage and position the company to be an outsized beneficiary as interest rates decline, which we believe will begin in the near term.
