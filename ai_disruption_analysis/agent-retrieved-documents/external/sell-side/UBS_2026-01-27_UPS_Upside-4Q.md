UPS reported upside adjusted 4Q25 EPS of $2.38/share vs Consensus of $2.21 and our estimate of $2.18/share despite a headwind from the parked MD11s / added aircraft lease expense we estimate was in the $45 mm range. Domestic revenue was 4 pp better than our forecast due to stronger RPU of +8.3% (vs our 6.6% est) and volume which fell -10.8% y/y compared to our -13.4% y/y estimate. Domestic margin was also better than our forecast at 10.2% vs our 9.5% forecast and margin was slightly up y/y. We expect a positive response from UPS stock to the 4Q and 2026 guide.

UPS provided guidance for 2026 of $89.7 bn in revenue which is up about 1% despite the headwind of about 1.5 mm pieces / day of domestic volume with AMZN that is leaving UPS. Their margin guide of 9.6% implies a slight 20 bp deterioration. We expect UPS to experience y/y pressure on its Domestic Package margin in 1H followed by improvement y/y in 2H resulting in full year Domestic margin which is roughly flat. Guidance implies about $7.15/share or roughly flat EPS compared to 2025 and it is ~ inline with Consensus of $7.12/sh and above our $6.77/sh estimate.

UPS's 4Q beat was driven primarily by better than forecast revenue performance in Domestic Package (4 pp better) while International Package revenue was also 2 pp above our estimate. We have been anticipating a 3% decline in total revenue in 2026 driven by the further glide down with AMZN but their guide implies about 1% growth. UPS is clearly on a better revenue trajectory vs our expectations which is supportive for EPS and the stock.

We apply a 15x P/E to our 2027 EPS of $7.73/share to derive our price target of $116. We rate UPS Buy.

United Parcel Service, Inc. operates as a logistics and package delivery company providing supply chain management services. Its logistics services include transportation, distribution, contract logistics, ground freight, ocean freight, air freight, and customs brokerage. The company operates through the following segments: U.S. Domestic Package, International Package, and Supply Chain and Freight. The U.S. Domestic Package segment offers a full spectrum of U.S. domestic guaranteed ground and air package transportation services. The International Package segment includes small package operations outside the U.S.

Our price target is based on a multiple of EPS. UPS is a cyclical company and their volume growth is sensitive to the pace of economic growth. Meaningful slowing in the pace of growth in the economy, relative to what we presently anticipate, is a source of risk to both our volume growth assumptions and also our operating margin forecasts. This translates to risk to our EPS forecasts and also to our price target for UPS stock. In our view, significant changes in logistics strategy by large eCommerce companies are sources of risk to pricing and B2C volumes for UPS. UPS has fuel surcharge mechanisms which offset most of the volatility in fuel prices. Nevertheless, we believe there is a benefit to their business from lower fuel prices and a risk from potential moves up in fuel prices.
