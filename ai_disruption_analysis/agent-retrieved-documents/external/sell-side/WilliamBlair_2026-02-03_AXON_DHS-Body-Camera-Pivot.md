February 3, 2026

On February 2, the Department of Homeland Security announced that all DHS agents operating in Minnesota will immediately begin wearing body-worn cameras, with plans to expand the policy nationwide as funding becomes available. The announcement followed late last week's disclosure of a proposed $20 million DHS body-camera funding allocation. The nationwide expansion represents a significant opportunity, with Customs and Border Protection reportedly having only 13,400 cameras for more than 45,000 officers, and Immigration and Customers Enforcement having roughly 4,400 cameras for a workforce of 22,000. We believe this mismatch confirms additional runway for adoption and reinforces the long-term demand outlook for Axon as federal agencies move back toward standardized camera usage.

While the incremental deployment is meaningful, we believe the larger significance lies in the policy reversal and normalization of federal body-worn camera adoption. President Trump rescinded the Biden administrations 2022 federal body-worn camera mandate in early 2025 but has now publicly praised cameras as 'good for law enforcement,' while DHS leadership has committed to eventually deploying them across all DHS law-enforcement agencies. This represents a sharp reversal in federal posture when contrasted with our note last week, where we highlighted the DHS's 2026 proposed budget cuts to the body-worn camera program. With DHS already relying on body-camera footage during high-profile incidents in Minneapolis and federal judges in Chicago requiring camera activation in immigration operations, momentum is back in favor of sustained body-worn camera adoption.

From a financial perspective, we believe the $20 million figure should be viewed as an initial funding marker rather than the full opportunity. Universal wear across DHS agencies would require tens of thousands of devices over time, with more meaningful upside through Axon's high-margin Evidence ecosystem, including cloud storage, digital evidence management, and compliance workflows. While near-term revenue impact will depend on appropriations and procurement timelines, we view this announcement as incremental validation of Axon's long-term federal growth thesis. Taken together, we believe the shift in federal tone and the likelihood of downstream software adoption strengthens Axon's federal growth runway and widens the gap between Axon and the rest of the body-camera ecosystem.

Axon provides technology solutions for the law enforcement market. Its products are used to provide less lethal alternative weapons, video cameras, evidence management, and records management. Axon's main products are the Taser electroshock weapon, Axon body and in-car cameras, Evidence.com video management system, and Axon Records RMS/CAD system. The value proposition of its products is to reduce the use of lethal force, increase transparency, simplify workflows, increase accessibility to video evidence, and increase law enforcement efficiency.

While we believe investors were disappointed by the company's results last quarter, commentary around strong pipeline and unchanged backlog growth expectations suggest that the business has not fundamentally changed, creating a compelling entry point for investors. In our view, Axon's near-term expectations are really unchanged and management anticipates exiting the year with a strong fourth quarter. We believe the U.S. federal government shutdown is not expected to have an impact and the company could deliver another very strong fourth quarter based on its current pipeline. Furthermore, Axon's management expressed confidence in the ability to sustain growth for a longer period of time than investors may anticipate given its commentary that growth could sustain at levels similar to current growth rates for the next three to five years.

We believe Axon is likely to benefit from technology modernization trends in the public safety vertical that should persist for years. The company's relentless focus on innovation has allowed it to disrupt markets by improving and evolving its products. What we believe investors may not be fully appreciating is that Axon has shown that it can enter existing markets and outcompete entrenched incumbents by modernizing traditional workflows with cutting-edge technology. In our view, this is creating new market opportunities in emerging areas such as AI, next-generation CAD, fixed ALPR, drones/counter drones, VR, and cloud software, where customers can significantly improve their existing workflow efficiency. As these products improve in value proposition, we are seeing new markets expand in areas such as international and enterprise. We believe Axon's ability to capture data at the sensor level and to also leverage this data across applications and AI create strong network effects and platform benefits over the long term.

The stock last closed trading at about 10.5 times our revenue forecast for 2026 of $3.41 billion. We believe the company continues to innovate and execute well with strong demand across the board for its solutions, which should lead to continued positive earnings revisions. We maintain our Outperform rating.

Primary risks for Axon's stock include: 1) competition, 2) pricing pressure in the body and in-car camera markets, 3) difficulty entering the RMS/CAD market, 4) ability to sustain high level of innovation, and 5) costs associated with defending intellectual property rights.
