We hosted a group investor meeting in the SF Bay Area w/ SNOW CFO Brian Robins, FP&A Head Brad Floering & IR Head Katherine McCracken. Mgmt was upbeat about consumption/ demand trends, product innovation velocity and GTM effectiveness. And SNOW announced its intent to acquire Observe, a compelling & seamless TAM enhancer. We come away incrementally confident in growth/margin trends. Reiterate Buy.

■ First 90 Day View: New CFO Brian Robins highlighted that in his first 90 days, he comes away highly encouraged by the velocity of innovation & caliber of GTM sales execution, noting that meetings w/ customers, from large banks to large pharma co's, reveal a high degree of enthusiasm around the core product & AI roadmap. Mr. Robins also cited how effective SNOW's ML models have been in analyzing & predicting consumption patterns on an account-by-account basis, which helps drive confidence in its guide methodologies. Lastly, mgmt noted that based on its 90-day view coming out of last qtr, vs. its prior 90day view, it has seen strengthened consumption trends, driven by data volumes, users, usecases & migrations, w/ elements outside of migrations becoming stronger drivers.

■ New Product & AI Traction: Key new product drivers include Snowpark, Dynamic Tables & Cortex AI. This broader platform is unlocking 2 dynamics - 1) capture more workloads earlier in the lifecycle (i.e. unstructured data that hasn't been transformed); & 2) augment core workloads w/ AI use-cases. ~50% of last qtr's new deals signed were influenced by its AI roadmap, noting that while initial deals are still driven by EDW migrations, AI-oriented products like Cortex, Snowflake Intelligence & OpenFlow are becoming more critical in customer wins and this starting to help drive stronger Data+AI wallet capture. Key AI usecases include querying unstructured data & building new AI chatbots, and Snowflake Intelligence is helping to broaden SNOW's user base w/ non-tech workers while also displacing trad'l BI dashboards.

■ Competitive Positioning: SNOW sees a long runway of core EDW/Analytics displacements, incl. legacy on-prem (i.e. TDC, Hadoop, Exadata) and 1st gen cloud deployments (i.e. Redshift & others). Moreover, SNOW has been working on AI tooling to help shorten migration timelines from trad'l 6-9 month levels, which we think can accelerate customer modernization timelines & rev consumption ramps. Regarding Databricks, mgmt cited no change competitively, and it generally sees a path for different swim lanes, noting that SNOW excels around ease-of-use and core data governance & analytics.

■ GTM: Mgmt is pleased with the shift in sales focus to drive stronger new logo generation, which began in early FY25 and started to meaningfully bear fruit in FY26. We think that as these customers go through ramp motions, they will become stronger rev drivers in FY27+. And after meaningful hiring motions in 1H FY26, mgmt is encouraged w/ ramp motions and productive sales capacity levels heading into FY27. SNOW does not anticipate any dramatic GTM changes in the new year, only continuous tweaks. It noted that newer vertical offerings (i.e. Intelligence, Observability) will help augment core horizontal playbooks and broaden expansion motions. Lastly, mgmt cited that <1% of revenue comes from AI companies and that it is being mindful of trying to target rev capture from this cohort given uncertainty around rev durability and profit economics, but that it will lean into opportunities if it sees compelling dynamics for core product attach. Mgmt remains committed to investments in growth alongside op

margin expansion.

SNOW's original focus was to disrupt the data warehousing market, which is a large and strategic market and one that we think will be enlarged by SNOW's innovation that breaks down cost barriers and democratizes the ability to build cross-enterprise analytic insights. But SNOW has a broader vision, via its Cloud Data Platform (expands workload/use-case capabilities) and Data Cloud (adds unique data sharing & exchange services), and there are already ISVs starting to build businesses on SNOW, giving it true platform status. We think SNOW is ushering in a high level of innovation to the large data management market, supporting a long growth runway. As companies become more data-driven and digital-oriented, SNOW should grow in strategic importance and wallet share.

SNOW was founded in 2012 and is considered the first vendor to have fully architected a data warehousing platform in the public cloud. It offers true multi-region and multi-cloud deployment across AWS, Azure, and GCP utilizing a single unified data layer. This has resulted in a unique data management platform that is designed for full elasticity, fast query processing, unlimited user concurrency, and unified data, all via a usage-based utility service. SNOW's Cloud Data Platform can serve a variety of workloads, enabling customers to unify data into a single source of truth to drive business insights, build data-driven apps, and share data. SNOW is disrupting traditional on-premise analytical database vendors while expanding the market by lowering costs and making it more affordable for companies of all sizes to deploy infrastructure for analytics initiatives. In FY25, SNOW had over 11,000 customers and nearly $3.6b in revenue.

■ 4Q Earnings ■ Snowflake Summit (June)

■ Product revenue growth of mid/high 20% in FY26 ■ ~124% net revenue retention rates ending FY26 ■ Mid/low 20% FCF margins

January 9, 2026 ■ Partnerships: Key new tech partnerships recently announced include GCP and Anthropic. The GCP partnership expansion is notable given that it only represents ~3% of revenue and that GCP's Big Query platform has been considered its closest competitor to date. Mgmt noted that 1) Google is starting to understand the workload capture benefits in partnering with SNOW, much like AWS and Azure already have; 2) there are real product roadmap and co-sell opportunities starting to be mapped out; and 3) growing success with Gemini is a notable contributing factor in the evolution of the relationship. Regarding Anthropic, SNOW is building both a technology (internal-facing & customer-facing) and GTM partnership, and noted that it is seeing strong adoption w/in its base of Anthropic's AI coding tools.

■ Observe Acquisition: Mgmt indicated that customers have been asking for certain Observability capabilities to help leverage its underlying core data platform and bring certain ITOps use-cases in-house. SNOW does not anticipate trying to compete directly with the likes of DDOG, who focuses on real-time monitoring & alerting; rather, it will be focused on complex analyses of large amounts of historic log data to do more long-ranged root-cause analysis, more akin to SIEM-like use-cases. SNOW plans to retain Observe sales teams while training the broader sales force to sell these use-cases.

❍ More About Observe: On Jan 8, SNOW announced its intent to acquire Observe, an AI Observability startup, for an undisclosed amount (we note prior reports indicated >$1b). Observe's platform is used to monitor infrastructure for latency spikes, server outages and other technical issues, and since it was built on top of Snowflake, it should make for a simpler integration. The acquisition expands SNOW's capabilities in the $50b+ IT operations market (ITOM). SNOW highlighted the acquisition extends the value of its AI Data Cloud, enabling enterprises to ingest and retain their telemetry data at a lower cost. Observe boasts an AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) Agent that leverages a unified context graph that correlates logs, metrics & traces, allowing teams to resolve production issues up to 10x faster when paired with SNOW's data platform. Additionally, the acquisition creates a unified, open-standard architecture, based on Apache Iceberg via SNOW and OpenTelemetry via

Observe. Observe last raised $156m in June '25, when it disclosed that revenue had increased 3x Y/Y, customer base up >2x Y/Y and that NRR was 180% while GRR was 93%. Our industry conversations suggest that revenue was expected to approach ~$75m this year w/ growth of nearly 100%. NYSE: SNOW ESG Score: 58/100 ESG Industry Percentile: 30 th

Establishing materiality is critical to evaluating a company's ESG performance. Factors most material in one sector (or to a particular company) may not be as important to another. In addition, the factors that are material - and the degree to which factors are material - can change over time. Applying data to frameworks established by SASB (the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and by FactSet, we present in the chart above the three most material ESG factors that investors should focus on for the company that is the subject of this report; the Dynamic Materiality™ of each factor (i.e., what percentage of overall materiality the category represents for the subject company); and a Score for the subject company in each of these three categories (on a 0 to 100 basis, with 50 being average). We also calculate an overall ESG Score for the subject company, which is presented above (in green) and on the cover of this report. A full explanation of how this ESG Score is derived is presented below.

200,000+ SOURCES 4,500,000+ DATA POINTS processed per month SCREENED BY ESG FRAMEWORK TD Cowen leverages technology from FactSet to generate our ESG scores. Truvalue uses artificial intelligence to capture the stakeholder view of how companies are performing on ESG metrics, using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) materiality framework (www.sasb.org). These data are leveraged to calculate a score for each company, which allows TD Cowen to have a common framework and uniform way to approach ESG discussions with our clients. TD Cowen ESG scores appear on Company and Company Quick Take notes and are updated daily.

The process begins with capturing unstructured data from more than 200,000 sources, in 38 languages. These data are culled from a wide range of sources with varied perspectives, including industry publications, news outlets, NGOs, trade unions, government sources, legal and regulatory filings, and academic publications. Natural language processing is used to interpret semantic content from the original sources and generate analytics by applying criteria consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks. Performance is scored on a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate more positive ESG performance, and scores below reflect more negative ESG performance. A score of NA means not enough data is available on the company to generate a score.

| Top 3 Material ESG Categories   | Dynamic Materiality TM   |   Score |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Customer Privacy                | 42%                      |      65 |
| Data Security                   | 11%                      |      42 |
| Employee Engagement             | 9%                       |      65 |

Our valuation methodology is primarily based on Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow (EV/FCF), followed by Price-to-Earnings (P/E). However, this varies by company; for instance, we will often use Enterprise Value to Revenue (EV/Revs) or a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis for software companies that are primarily subscriptions-based, or for growth companies that have recently entered the public equity markets. We make investment recommendations on certain early stage, pre-revenue companies based upon an assessment of their business model, technology, probability of market success, and the potential market opportunity, balanced by an assessment of applicable risks. Such companies may not be assigned a price target.

The global economy or specific end markets significantly worsen, contracting IT spending and impairing software growth. The rate of SaaS/Cloud adoption slows, resulting in prolonged sales cycles and higher-than-anticipated quarterly volatility across much of our coverage universe. Competition increases materially, driving deflationary pricing pressure and compressing margins. In particular, innovation by new entrants in the software sector often produces solutions with similar or better functionality at materially lower prices than incumbents' legacy offerings.

■ The market is highly competitive with AWS, MSFT Azure, and GCP being both partners and competitors. SNOW also faces competition from TDC, IBM, HP, and other legacy vendors. ■ SNOW's consumption-based model will likely see greater revenue volatility vs. a typical subscription-based software model. ■ The ability to maintain such high levels of growth requires efficient scaling of internal business operations, including sales operations management.
