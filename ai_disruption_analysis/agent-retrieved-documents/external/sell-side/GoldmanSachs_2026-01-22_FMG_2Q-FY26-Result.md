FMG reported a solid Dec Q result but slightly below our estimates (see Exhibit 2), with total Fe shipments of 50.5Mt 2% below our forecast, and hematite unit costs of US$19.1/t 8% above our US$17.7/t estimate, but partly due to cost impacts from inventory unwind. Iron ore price realisations on hematite (87% of the 62% Fe Index) were in-line with GSe; however, Iron Bridge realisations of 115% of the 62% Fe Index slightly below our 118% estimate. The Iron Bridge plant struggled again with shipments of 2.2Mt relatively fl at QoQ. Despite all of this, FY26 operating and cost guidance is unchanged (see Exhibit 3), but we note that hematite unit costs are tracking to the high end, and Iron Bridge volumes tracking below the bottom end. Net debt ended the half at US$1.0bn (vs. GSe US$0.7bn), capex

was US$1.7bn and tracking below guidance of US$3.4bn, although capex is typically weighted more to 2H, and will also step-up with spend on the decarbonisation program.

The new Pilbara product strategy is underway with a small reduction in higher grade West Pilbara Fines (WPF) and small increase in lower grade Super Special Fines (SSF) in the sales mix during the Q. As a recap; FMG's new product strategy involves increasing margins and value by reducing operating costs (lowering strip ratios), rephasing capex, and lowering product grade, by phase out of FMG's higher grade Western Pilbara Fines (WPF) product (over FY26) and introduction of a new low-grade 55% Fe product from FY27 (to account for ~5-6% of production or ~10-12Mtpa). It also incorporates the inclusion of the capital-light Blacksmith project which will enable an extension of the Queens mine and replacement of the Firetail mine at the Solomon hub from around 2030, and will allow for the deferral of the major hub development of capital intensive Mindy South and Nyidinghu mine developments,

pushing capital spend into the next decade. Overall, we see FMG's new product strategy as being value accretive by around US$2.5-3bn (or ~US$1/sh or ~A$1.3/sh) which is on our base case model.

The update on the performance and ramp-up of the Iron Bridge magnetite project lacked details, although FMG said on the conference call that around 1Mt of concentrate was produced in Dec vs. 2.3Mt for the entire Q. FMG reset the ramp-up targets on Iron Bridge in May 2025, delaying the ramp-up by 18-24 months and is now targeting nameplate capacity of 22Mtpa by FY28 (previously targeted for Sep 2025 back in 2023). This implies a 5-yr ramp-up, which would place the project as one of the slower ramp-ups of a mining processing plant globally of this size. Regarding the ramp-up pro fi le, FMG expect shipments of 10-12Mt in FY26, ramping to a run-rate of 16-20Mtpa by 2H FY27, and nameplate of 22Mtpa by FY28, with

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 further process optimisation requirements anticipated although nothing speci fi c has been disclosed. Shipments were 4.3Mt in 1H FY26, and need to step up to ~12Mtpa run-rate to achieve the bottom end of FY26 guidance. All that said, we note that Iron Bridge (IB) contributes just ~US$240mn or ~3% to our FMG FY27-28 EBITDA, and we value the project at US$1.5bn which is just ~3% of our FMG NAV.

We revise our FY26/27/28 EBITDA by -2%/-3%/-2% after increasing hematite unit costs slightly and pulling back our ramp-up of Iron Bridge across FY26-27. Our NAV is down 3% to A$22.3/sh, and our 12m PT is also -3% to A$22.1/sh. We continue to rate FMG a Neutral based on;

Relative valuation: FMG is trading at ~1x NAV; a premium to RIO & BHP on our 1. estimates; BHP at ~0.8x NAV and RIO at ~0.8x NAV; however, at a ~6x NTM EV/EBITDA (vs. BHP/RIO on ~6x/6x), and ~5% NTM FCF (~6% at spot) vs. BHP/RIO on ~4%/6%. Low grade 58% Fe product realisations to stay supported near term: low grade 2. 58% Fe product realisations to stay supported over the near to medium term (still widening in our long-term view), due to low coking coal prices and low Chinese steel mill margins (mills favour high-grade iron ore during high-margin environment). Execution and ramp-up risks on the Iron Bridge project in FY26 & FY27: due to 3. water availability and also reliability and performance of key processing equipment (air classi fi ers etc) which is still yet to be fully tested. 4.

Capex to stay elevated on iron ore sustaining, Energy and Pilbara - decarbonisation: sustaining capex in the Pilbara is stepping up to maintain hematite group shipments at ~190Mtpa going forward. Combined with the ~US$8bn decarb program & ongoing but lower spend on H2 project studies, we expect capex to stay elevated at around US$4bn over the medium term. As a result, we expect the dividend payout ratio to remain broadly around 60% (towards the bottom end of the 50-80% guidance range), with gross gearing to average ~25-30% by FY27 (bottom end of company's target of 30-40%). The company does have levers it can pull on opex and capex if required, particularly cutting and deferring green capex. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We revise our FY26/27/28 EBITDA by -2%/-3%/-2% after increasing hematite unit n costs slightly and pulling back our ramp-up of Iron Bridge across FY26-27. Our NAV is down 3% to A$22.3/sh, and our 12m PT is also 3% to A$22.1/sh. Our PT methodology remains based on a 50:50 NAV:EV/EBITDA with a target n multiple of 6x (unchanged).

Upside risks: Ongoing iron ore price strength and possible upside to Chinese and n Rest-of-World steel demand in 2026. Higher Iron Bridge production in 2026, strong hematite production performance. Higher-than-expected FCF and dividends. Possible Fortescue Energy project monetisation and value creation from Pilbara decarb and green hydrogen. Downside risks: Iron ore price weakness: weakness in steel pricing and demand n could negatively impact the price for iron ore. Decreased price realisations vs. 62% Fe for either 58% hematite product or Iron Bridge magnetite premium product. Iron Bridge execution risks and ramp-up delays. Other risks include operating issues due to equipment reliability, supply disruptions, and higher capex on industry in fl ation.

Unless otherwise stated, the individuals listed on the cover page of this report are analysts in Goldman Sachs' Global Investment Research division.

Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.
