January 30, 2026

Toast is scheduled to report 4Q results after the market close on Thursday, February 12th with a conference call planned for 5pm ET. We suspect the company will modestly exceed our forecasts (and the consensus), though we suspect Y/Y growth and margin expansion will be more moderate compared to the last 4-6 quarters. With results, we expect management will provide their initial 2026 financial guidance ranges, and we anticipate they will bracket the consensus. We are maintaining our NEUTRAL rating on Toast and trimming our price target to $36 (from $42) given recent pressure on peer multiples.

TOST - NYSE Price Target ↓ $36.00 Price (1/30/26) $31.11 Industry TECHNOLOGY

Total Debt/Total Capital Cash per share (9/30/25) BV Per Share (9/30/25) Dividend n.a. $3.05 $3.29 $0.00 (0.0%) Return on Equity (T-T-M) n.a. Trading Data Shares Outstanding (M) 612.0 Market Capitalization ($M) $19,039 52-week range $28.12 - $49.66 Avg. Volume (3-mth.) (K) 8,435.3 For the 4Q, we are forecasting Toast generated 25% Y/Y growth in Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit to $491M (with the consensus at $492M). Quarterly guidance called for 22%-25% Y/Y growth to $480M-$490M. We are forecasting a 34% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $149M (matching the consensus) and we suspect the company will exceed the consensus by 5%-10%. Over the last six quarters, the company has exceeded the consensus adjusted EBITDA forecast by an average of 26%.

For 2025, we expect the company generated over $600M in free cash flow and ended the year with $2.04B in unrestricted cash and equivalents and no debt. We estimate management directed $25M to repurchases in the 4Q (and $79M for the year). With an impressive net cash position, Toast management has the flexibility to continue to invest in the business and repurchase shares while also pursuing complementary acquisitions. With results, we expect management will provide their initial 2026 financial guidance ranges, and we anticipate they will bracket our forecasts and the consensus. At an investment conference in early December, Toast's CFO relayed they continue to expect recurring gross profit growth in 2026 will be above 20%. She also reiterated the expectation for higher investments focused on new verticals and expanding sales and marketing capacity that will lead to adjusted EBITDA margins being flat to slightly up from the ~33% expected in 2025.

Acknowledging the company's massive margin expansion over the last three years and that margins in 2025 will be in their intermediate term goal range of 30%-35%, it makes sense to expect a moderation of margin expansion over the next 2-3 years. That said, with incremental margins on Fintech and Subscription gross profit above 50%, we suspect it will be difficult for management to increase their investments enough to result in flattish margins in 2026. In our view, the one thing that could weigh on margins more significantly would be the acquisition of one or more sub-scale companies in tangential areas or new geographies. We are maintaining our NEUTRAL rating on Toast and trimming our price target to $36 (from $42) given recent pressure on peer multiples. Our new target represents an enterprise value of 20 times our 2027 adjusted EBITDA forecast of $1,016M.

Boston, MA: Launched in 2013, Toast has rapidly become a leading provider of bundled proprietary, cloud-based software, payment processing, and related hardware and services for the US restaurant industry. The company's turnkey solution allows restaurants, primarily small and mediumsized operators at this time, to consolidate a number of third-party vendors into one relationship with Toast. The company ended 2024 with 134K customer locations (up 26% Y/Y). Toast completed their initial public offering of 25M shares (including the overallotment) at $40 per share in September 2021,

With 3Q25 results, management provided guidance for the 4Q, including 22%-25% Y/Y growth in Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit to $480M-$490M. Adjusted EBITDA was expected to increase 26%-35% Y/Y to $140M-$150M with related margins expanding 90bp-230bp Y/Y to 29.2%-30.6% of Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit.

Source: Company Filings For the 4Q, we are forecasting Toast generated 21% Y/Y growth in total revenue to $1,623M (with the consensus at $1,618M). As Toast's total revenue includes a significant amount of pass-through payment processing costs (with no margin), total revenue is not the best measure to track the company's growth. Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit is a measure designed to better reflect the company's recurring gross profit streams. We are forecasting 25% Y/Y growth in Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit to $491M (with the consensus at $492M). We are forecasting the company added just over 7,600 net new locations in the quarter, ending the period with just over 163K total locations. We estimate the company ended the year with roughly 12K aggregate locations for international restaurant locations, enterprise, and US SMB food & beverage retail locations. We anticipate gross payment volume (GPV) increased by 21% Y/Y to $51.1B.

We have seen notable improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins over the last two years. As a percentage of FinTech & Subscription Gross Profit, adjusted EBITDA margins reached just over 27% in 2024 compared to a negative 17% in 2022. We are forecasting a 34% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $149M (matching the consensus) and we suspect the company will exceed the consensus by 5%-10%. Over the last six quarters, the company has exceeded the consensus adjusted EBITDA forecast by an average of 26%. We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA margins increased 90bp Y/Y to 9.2% of revenue. As a percentage of FinTech & Subscription gross profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 210bp to 30.4%.

Along with strong margin expansion over the last two years, the company has also converted to a growing base of positive cash flow. The company generated $306M in free cash flow in 2024, compared to a loss of $190M in 2022. For 2025, we expect the company generated over $600M in free cash flow and ended the year with $2.04B in unrestricted cash and equivalents and no debt. We estimate management directed $25M to repurchases in the 4Q (and $79M for the year). 2 With an impressive net cash position, Toast management has the flexibility to continue to invest in the business and repurchase shares while also pursuing complementary acquisitions.

With 3Q results, management raised the midpoint of their prior 2025 Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit range by 2.5% and the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA range by 7%. Updated guidance included 32% Y/Y growth in NonGAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit to $1,865M-$1,875 and 64%-66% Y/Y growth in adjusted EBITDA to $610M$620M. Adjusted EBITDA guidance contemplated margins as a percent of Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit of 32.7%-33.1% compared to 26.3% in 2024. At an investment conference in early December, Toast's CFO, Elena Gomez, participated in a fireside chat, and she relayed the company is on track to generate 32% recurring gross profit (Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit) growth in 2025, with adjusted EBITDA margins (as a percentage of Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit) at 33%. This was consistent with the guidance update provided with 3Q25 results.

Source: Fiserv SpendTrend Management also noted the company's overall adjusted EBITDA margins have been running in the company's intermediate term goal range of 30%-35% for the last three quarters, and the core operations (excluding recent TAM expansions) are running at the long-term goal of 40%. Given that, management indicated they expected to increase investments in a number of areas and that will likely limit margin expansion in 2026. As noted, Toast has generated massive margin expansion over the last three years, taking adjusted EBITDA margins (as a percentage of Fintech and Subscription gross profit) from negative 17% in 2022, to a positive 6% in 2023, 26% in 2024, and likely above 33% in 2025.

At the investment conference in early December, Toast's CFO relayed they continue to expect recurring gross profit growth in 2026 will be above 20%. She also reiterated the expectation for higher investments focused on new verticals and expanding sales and marketing capacity that will lead to adjusted EBITDA margins being flat to slightly up from the ~33% expected in 2025. While our forecasts and consensus are predicting 21%-22% Y/Y growth in Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit, our forecasts and consensus for 2026 adjusted EBITDA margins are predicting modest Y/Y expansion (34.9% (up 190bp Y/ Y) and 34.4% (up 140bp Y/Y), respectively).

The CFO's comments echo her comments made at the same conference In December of 2024, when the CFO indicated an expectation of 100bp-200bp of margin expansion in 2025 for adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Fintech and Subscription gross profit (over 26.3% margins in 2024). However, the company materially outperformed those original comments and their most recent 2025 guidance predicts 640bp-680bp of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to 32.7%-33.1%. Acknowledging the company's massive margin expansion over the last three years and that margins in 2025 will be in their intermediate term goal range of 30%-35%, it makes sense to expect a moderation of margin expansion over the next 2-3 years. That said, with incremental margins on Fintech and Subscription gross profit above 50%, we suspect it will be difficult for management to increase their investments enough to result in flattish margins in 2026.

In our view, the one thing that could weigh on margins more significantly would be the acquisition of one or more sub-scale companies in tangential areas or new geographies. While the company has only made a handful of small acquisitions in their history, they have significant flexibility to pursue additional deals. We expect the company ended 2025 with $2.04B in unrestricted cash and equivalents and no debt. Consistent with prior commentary, Gomez also stated the company expects core net location adds in 2025 and 2026 will be in line with the 28K net location adds in 2024. However, when including the newer growth markets (international markets, enterprise customers, and US SMB food & beverage retailers), the company expects total net adds in 2025 will be above 2024 and 2026 net adds should be above 2025. Our forecasts are embedding 29K-30K net adds in each of the next two years.

At the company's Investor Day in May 2024, management updated their intermediate-term aspirational goals for growth in recurring gross profit (Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit) and adjusted EBITDA margins as a percent of NonGAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit. Management indicated they expected to generate 20% compound annual growth in recurring gross profit from 2024 to 2027 and expand adjusted EBITDA (as a percent of Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit) to 30%-35% by 2027. 4 As noted, the company is nicely ahead of plan in regard to margins, and they should generate adjusted EBITDA as a percent of Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit at 33% or better for 2025. In the longer-term, management indicated a goal of reaching 40% adjusted EBITDA margins (as a percent of Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit).

Launched in 2013, Toast has rapidly become a leading provider of bundled proprietary, cloud-based software, payment processing, and related hardware and services for the US restaurant industry. The company's turnkey solution allows restaurants, primarily small and medium-sized operators, to consolidate a number of third-party vendors into one relationship with Toast. Toast ended 2024 with approximately 134K restaurant locations and processed over $159B of gross payment volume for the year. The company's software consists of more than a dozen modules to automate restaurant operations and connect the front of the house (hosts and servers) with the back of house operations (kitchen) across dine-in, takeout, and delivery channels. Toast's software runs on Android, which enables dynamic data connection across the entire restaurant ecosystem and materially lowers the cost of related POS devices and other hardware (relative to older systems).

From 2019 to 2024, Toast increased the number of locations served and gross payment volume at compound annual rates of 38% and 49%, respectively. Over the same time frame, total revenue grew at a compound annual rate of 49%, led by compound annual growth in Subscription revenue of 62%. The faster rate of growth in Subscription revenue was driven by expanding the breadth of software solution modules through both internal development and a handful of smaller acquisitions. In 2023, Toast launched their brand in Canada, Ireland and the UK, as an initial effort to unlock the significant opportunity outside of the US. In 2Q25, they launched the brand in Australia. At the Investor Day in May 2024, management announced plans to expand the current addressable market to US SMB Food & Beverage Retail locations. With 2Q25 results, management indicated they reached 10K aggregate locations for international Restaurant locations, US SMB Food & Beverage Retail locations, and Enterprise locations.

In April 2025, Toast announced an agreement with Dine Brands Global, Inc., the parent company of Applebee's Neighborhood Grill, to implement Toast technology at approximately 1,500 Applebee's locations nationwide. With 2Q25 results, the company announced an agreement with Firehouse Subs, a sandwich chain with approximately 1,300 locations. While the wins of Applebee's and Firehouse Subs are not necessarily meaningful to overall growth on their base of nearly 150k locations, they are additional proof points on their ability to move up to larger chains.

As a leading cloud-based provider with a sole focus on the restaurant vertical, the company has taken share from legacy software and payment processing providers. That said, the market for electronic payment processing services is highly competitive and there are a number of competitors that have a partial focus on the restaurant space. Legacy players like NCR Voyix' Aloha platform (VYX BUY ) and the restaurant POS subsidiary (formerly Micros) of Oracle (ORCL) have been working to upgrade their systems. There are a number of large, publicly-traded competitors with bundled solutions, including Shift4 Payments (FOURBUY ), Fiserv's (FI) Clover POS solution, and the restaurant-focused portion of Lightspeed Commerce (LSPD)). Given a relatively strong set of vertically-focused competitors, we believe Toast will need to continue to invest in their capabilities (including additional functionality for larger chains) in order to continue gaining market share at attractive pricing and contract terms.

We believe management is making the right moves to allow Toast to become a long-term leader in the integrated software and payment solutions market for the restaurant industry. Despite an expected steady rise in the competitive intensity in the industry, with a strong brand and scaled operations, we believe the company is well-positioned to continue to generate solid growth in revenue and related KPIs over the next 2-3 years. 5

On the 3Q25 call, management noted the company's overall adjusted EBITDA margins (as a percentage of Non-GAAP FinTech & Subscription gross profit) have been running in the company's intermediate term goal range of 30%-35% for the last three quarters, and the core operations (excluding recent TAM expansions into international markets, enterprise customers, and food and beverage retailers) are running at the long-term goal of 40%. Given that, management indicated they expect to increase investments in a number of areas and that will likely limit margin expansion in 2026. Over the next 3-5 years, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins can reach their longer-term target of 40% as a percentage of FinTech & Subscription Gross Profit.

Moving Up-Market Within the Restaurant Vertical: Management has been successful in developing bundled automation and payment solutions designed to meet the needs of restaurants, primarily small- and medium-sized operators. In April 2025, Toast announced an agreement with Dine Brands Global, Inc., the parent company of Applebee's Neighborhood Grill, to implement Toast technology at approximately 1,500 Applebee's locations nationwide. With 2Q25 results, the company announced an agreement with Firehouse Subs, a sandwich chain with approximately 1,300 locations. Over the next 2-3 years, we expect the company will have success signing larger chains (>500 locations) and larger wins should help the company drive revenue growth and further leverage fixed costs.

TAM Expansion: In 2023, Toast launched their brand in Canada, Ireland and the UK, as an initial effort to unlock the significant opportunity outside of the US. In 2Q25, they launched the brand in Australia. At the Investor Day in May 2024, management announced plans to expand the current addressable market to US SMB Food & Beverage Retail locations. With 2Q25 results, management indicated they reached 10K aggregate locations for international restaurant locations, US SMB food & beverage retail locations, and Enterprise locations. With 3Q25 results, management noted the more recent growth markets (international markets, enterprise customers, and US SMB food & beverage retailers) are on pace to collectively reach $100M in ARR in 2025. Acquisitions: With $1.86B in unrestricted cash and equivalents and no debt at the end of 3Q25, Toast is well-positioned to consider strategic or consolidating acquisitions. While the company has only completed a handful of relatively small acquisitions, primarily to expand their solution set, we think management would consider larger deals.

Sole Focus on Restaurant Vertical: The company's sole focus on the US restaurant vertical (particularly small and mediumsized operators) concentrates risk for investors. The restaurant industry is known for low barriers to entry and high-failure rates. In addition, the US restaurant industry has seen a steady move towards larger national or regional chain restaurants over sole proprietors and local restaurant groups and the company has not yet demonstrated success with large chains.

Sensitivity to Economic Conditions: The company generates payment processing revenue primarily as a percentage of end-to-end payment volume from consumer spending at restaurants. In addition, the company's monthly subscription revenue from automation software is sensitive to the number of customers. We note that most of the company's strong growth over the last several years has primarily been driven by net new customers, however, quarterly results can be affected by fluctuations in consumer spending. An unfavorable change in economic conditions (or an external factor like the pandemic) could affect consumer spending trends, which could negatively impact payment volumes and thus, total revenue and earnings. As well, a large portion of the company's customers are small businesses, which could experience impaired operations and higher than expected failure rates in a protracted period of economic weakness.

Toast Capital Participates in Loans to Customers: The company began providing working capital loans through Toast Capital to customers through a banking partner in 2020. Included within the Financial Technology solutions segment, the company generates fees earned from marketing and servicing working capital loans to customers. In addition, Toast Capital can earn credit performance fees tied to the portfolio performance. The bank partner originates all loans, and Toast Capital then services the loans using their payments infrastructure to remit a fixed percentage of daily sales until the loan is paid back. Toast Capital is responsible for purchasing loans in default (or loans that are scheduled to be charged off) from the bank partner until the aggregate principal amount of such purchased loans equals 15% of the total originated amount for each quarterly loan cohort. On a quarterly basis in 2023, the company generated an average of just over $31M in gross profit from other FinTech solutions (primarily Toast Capital) - roughly 15% of the company's total gross profit in 2023 (12% of FinTech & Subs gross profit). While adding credit exposure to SMB restaurants may seem like an

unnecessary risk for a highquality growth story, the borrowing limits are fairly low ($5K-$250K) and the terms are fairly short (90-360 day loan periods). That said, we expect Toast Capital will add additional uncertainty to forecasts as well as some occasional quarter to quarter volatility in earnings. We expect these dynamics may lead to relatively more rapid shifts in investor sentiment in the event of a macro-economic shock. Given the potential for volatility in this line item, we would prefer that the percentage contribution from other FinTech solutions to FinTech & Subsciption gross profit doesn't materially exceed 15% on an annual basis.

Competitive Environment: The market for electronic payment processing services is highly competitive and the industry is dominated by a number of large competitors. There are several large, publicly-traded competitors offering restaurant software, point of sale solutions, and/or payment processing solutions (including Shift4 Payments (FOURBUY ), NCR Voyix Corp's Aloha platform (VYXBUY ), Fiserv's (FISV) Clover POS solution, the restaurant POS subsidiary (formerly Micros) of Oracle (ORCLNEUTRAL ), and the restaurant-focused portion of Lightspeed Commerce (LSPD)). In addition, there are several well-funded, private players such as Restaurant 365 and TouchBistro. Given a relatively strong set of verticallyfocused competitors, the company may face challenges gaining (or retaining) market share at attractive pricing and contract terms.

Multiple Classes of Shares Concentrate Voting Power: The company has two classes of common stock (A & B), with Class B shares carrying ten times the voting power of Class A shares. When combining the ownership of the executive team, the Board of directors, and three pre-IPO venture capital investors, this group holds roughly 25% of the aggregate shares outstanding and 69% of the voting power. This concentration of voting power would make it very difficult for minority shareholders to effect change in the management or the direction of the company. Reliance on Merchant Processing Partners: Like many other integrated merchant acquirers, Toast relies on a limited number of merchant processing partners for back-end processing. Until 2023, the company had an exclusive master merchant payment facilitator (PayFac) relationship with the Worldpay operations of FIS Global (FIS) but added another partner in 2022. An interruption of service could damage the company's relationship with customers and result in legal difficulties and/or monetary settlements.

Regulatory Compliance: The merchant acquiring and payment processing industries are subject to government regulation and the rules of the major card networks and oversight bodies (such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards Council). Data Security: Unauthorized access by third-parties that leads to the theft of non-public personal information and/or corruption of systems could bring the risk that the company is exposed to reputational damage, financial liability, customer loss, and possible regulatory scrutiny.

IR denotes Institutional Research; WMR denotes Wealth Management Research whose rating scale is Buy/Add, Neutral, Sell/Reduce. Investment Banking Distribution denotes companies from whom D.A. Davidson & Co. has received compensation in the last 12 months. Best-of-Breed: Expected to outperform on a risk adjusted basis over a five-year time horizon.

Target prices are our Institutional Research Department's evaluation of price potential over the next 12 months, based upon our assessment of future earnings and cash flow, comparable company valuations, growth prospects and other financial criteria. Certain risks may impede achievement of these price targets including, but not limited to, broader market and macroeconomic fluctuations and unforeseen changes in the subject company's fundamentals or business trends. While the Best-of-Breed designation does not contain a separate rating and/or price target from that of the standard ratings system referenced above, the expectation is that the security, based on the 12 criteria utilized in assessing the 'Best-ofBreed' designation, will outperform over a five-year time horizon, not the standard 12-18 month time horizon.
