✓ Quick Reaction to Newsflow/Volatility

HOOD - Straight Up Not Having A Good Time Robinhood shares were particularly pressured today, with shares down (10)% underperforming nearly everything: the market up a bit, financials names were generally up, other crypto stocks ~(4)-(8)% with Bitcoin down ~(7)%, and capital markets stocks were largely +/- flat. We didn't see much in a PFOF release on Friday to raise our eyebrows, and we are generally in agreement with investors who believe the selloff is related to concern about retail investor activity levels. While some high momentum retail favorites such as metals have been hit hard recently, leading to fears regarding HOOD's asset flows, user growth, and trading activity, we still like HOOD longer term. Looking ahead to earnings next week, consensus estimates for 4Q25 seem about on track (understandably given prior monthly volume disclosures giving us October, November, and ~90% of December). HOOD puts out this PFOF disclosure every quarter.

Exhibit 3 - If 4Q looks OK ahead of next week's print though, what about looking forward? Precious metals (shown here using ETF prices) are some assets that saw very large moves up to begin the year and large declines in recent days/weeks, so momentum-chasing investors may have been caught flat-footed Source: FactSet While it's normal to see HOOD sell off in sympathy to Bitcoin, clearly that's not the whole story - Robinhood is underperforming not just the digital currency, but also other more pure-play crypto stocks. Crypto trading revenues are just ~15% of revenue growth for this year in HOOD consensus, and less in our model, which has crypto down YoY.

Exhibit 4 - While it makes intuitive sense that HOOD customers would bring in more money when assets like crypto are outperforming, and vice versa, we do not see evidence of this in the monthly data

Source: Company Reports, FactSet Exhibit 5 - While HOOD's asset flows tend to be agnostic to crypto prices, the stock price itself is generally much more sensitive 1-Month Price Performance (HOOD vs. BTC, since 2021) Source: FactSet Exhibit 6 - Crypto is not as central to HOOD's revenue growth as it once was. Our model (shown below) has down crypto revenues this year, but consensus revenue also has lower reliance on crypto to meet modeled HOOD revenues vs. prior years

Source: Company Reports, Truist Securities estimates One of the big bear pushbacks we heard from investors following our launch on HOOD in December is that Robinhood's lower asset level customer base, along with investors being more concentrated in higher beta assets, means greater sensitivity to market or broader economic downturns. While the beta point is fair, on the asset level debate, we'd note that while HOOD assets per account trail more established peers by a wide margin, it's not as though Robinhood customers are all low income: nearly half have incomes over $100k.

Source: Company Reports Exhibit 8 - That said, a near majority of HOOD customers earn high incomes already today

The current market backdrop has made things more challenging for Robinhood's client activity, to say nothing of sentiment on the stock. Candidly, our Buy rating with which we initiated coverage on HOOD shares in December has clearly not worked so far. However, despite the realization of these more near-term headwinds, we remain positive on HOOD's longer-term prospects, even if it is a bumpy road along the way. We think Robinhood has one of the clearest lines of sight in the race to build a financial superapp for the next generation. Given leading market share with younger demographics, HOOD should see tailwinds as it grows alongside its customer base's improving financial products. Banking and international are two areas that have the potential to meaningfully expand Robinhood's TAM outside its initial active trader userbase. These growth prospects, along with Robinhood's economies of scale facilitated by its digital-native operating model, give the company a high degree of operating leverage and should drive continued profitability gains.

Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD) is a tech-native retail broker catering to investors and traders across equities, options, crypto, and prediction markets. The company has rapid product velocity and is expanding into institutional trading and operates an exchange (both via Bitstamp in Crypto), advisory (via roboadvisory and through the acquisition of RIA TradePMR), and internationally in Europe and soon Asia. Robinhood initially catered to smaller accounts with less complex needs, offering low prices and a simple and intuitive user interface. However, it has been moving upmarket and meeting increasingly complex financial needs for clients via new and expanded offerings, with ambitions to become the preferred financial partner for the next generation.

We rate Robinhood (HOOD) shares Buy. We believe Robinhood's combination of organic growth and high margins is rare among financials and indeed the broader large-cap market, justifying the company's premium valuation. From a growth standpoint, HOOD has multiple avenues to achieve its growth prospects across user growth and increasing ARPU, both of which are fueled by a leading user experience and product velocity. Longer-term expansion into broader financial offerings beyond trading and brokerage (e.g. banking or advisory) and into international markets remain in the very early stages for Robinhood and are not embedded into our assumptions in any meaningful way, representing further potential upside. In addition, as the company continues to build out its product set, it is becoming more diversified in terms of revenue standpoint. The company operates with a relatively high fixed cost base and high incremental margins, so profits should generally grow even faster than revenues.

Our $155 price target is based on a multiple of ~42x our 2028E GAAP EPS estimate of $3.70, derived from a weighted average of our base, bull, and bear EPS cases. Downside risks to our rating and price target include: slowing market trading volumes, a deceleration in user growth, and challenges achieving success at scale with new customer groups outside of U.S. active traders.
