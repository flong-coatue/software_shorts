Datacenter update: ETN reported >200% orders growth in Datacenters in Q425 in the EA segment, and Datacenter sales were up ~45% in 2025 for ETN overall. For 2026 / 2027 we est. +36% / +28% organic sales growth in Datacenters (excluding Distributed IT). Adjusting for the spin out of Mobility and the acquisition of Boyd, we estimate that Datacenters will comprise ~30% of the pro forma revenue mix of ETN overall. Operating leverage remains in focus: ETN’s Q1 operating margin guide caught our attention today, implying a -150bps decline y-o-y, with +30bps guided for 2026 overall. Within the EA segment, we estimate operating margins decline by 250-300bps y-o-y in Q1, and are down -40bps y-o-y in Q2, before expanding 100-200ps y-o-y in the 2H as the ‘ramp’ headwinds fade.

It is hard to tell if the margin guide for the year is ‘sandbagged’ or not, particularly if the Q1 guide is reasonable (rather than being too low – it seems that the recent snowy weather may cap the operational upside). When we look at EA capex/sales for instance, it has been steady over the past 3 years (rather than ‘spiking’ higher in 2025), so it is hard to tell why the margins were suddenly hit recently (and hence it is also hard to tell from the outside why they would suddenly leap up in the 2H26). Mobility spin: This business is due to spin out by the end of Q127, which create some risk of ‘spin limbo’. We value the business at 9X 2027E EV/EBITDA and ~21X 2027E P/FCF, based off peer multiples. On a SoTP basis, we see potential downside to ETN’s share price.

FCF remains sub-par: ETN’s 2026 guidance embeds ~80% FCF conversion from adjusted net income, after ~75% in 2025. Over the last 3 years, FCF conversion is ~80%. Alongside potential improvements in operating leverage, we wait to see whether FCF conversion can also improve.

While organic sales growth should remain above-average, we think EPS revision momentum will be more muted now than in the past. In this light, the valuation looks quite high. Upside case Stronger-than-expected rebound in ESS, which would carry healthy incremental margins. Downside case Moderation in non-residential / datacenter growth, and lingering input cost concerns.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System: Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone. Stock Rating Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon. Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company. Industry View Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving. Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating. Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence

as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by Barclays or a third party (“Information”), in relation to any actual or potential ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes (“ESG Regimes”), unless otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification, label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
