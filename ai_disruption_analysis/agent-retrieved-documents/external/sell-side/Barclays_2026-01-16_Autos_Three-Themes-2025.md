With investors focused on opportunities for auto stocks in ’26, we thought it helpful to look back at the performance of auto stocks in ’25. Despite a year with significant volatility and with fundamentals quite choppy, especially amid the onset of tariffs, auto stocks nevertheless posted a strong year, trading up ~27% on average vs SPX +16%. Yet unpacking the performance yields interesting takes, as our stocks almost exclusively saw strength on multiple re-ratings, with earnings revisions broadly either flat or negative. We believe that three key themes emerged: • For legacy OEMs, it was the case for a multiple re-rating finally emerging, with the bad news of tariffs eventually serving as good news • For suppliers, despite questions on secular positioning, it was an improvement to historical multiples, with a reminder that sometimes there is such a thing as too cheap, and with the market focusing on the strength of earnings / cash flows

• For Tesla/RIVN, it was the acceleration of narrative (i.e. “narrative command” on steroids), with fundamentals increasingly an afterthought (especially for Tesla) For more, see our Valuation Chartbook from last year, which helps frame the dynamics of how auto stocks trade.

And sometimes bad news is good news Both Ford and GM outperformed sharply in ’25, with Ford +33%, GM +53% vs SPX +16%. Yet we’d characterize OEM outperformance in ’25 as “sometimes bad news is good news,” as the strength in the stocks purely reflected multiple, even in the face of weaker earnings…with the case for multiple re-rating increasingly cemented.

Into ’25 both Ford and GM were fighting the question of peak earnings, as investors questioned whether strong pricing results could sustain. This dynamic led to mixed/muted interest in the stocks, even though GM had been posting strong results. Then came the tariffs – a policy move which drove significant earnings headwinds. And yet even with Ford/GM exiting the year with significant headwinds (gross tariffs of ~$2bn for Ford, ~$4bn for GM), both stocks sharply outperformed. We’d attribute the strength to several factors: • Most notably the benefits from an easing of EV regulations, a critical point given both companies likely lost ~$4-5bn on EVs in ’25. And while some have asked how F/GM are positioned long-term on EVs, EVs are likely of far reduced relevance for at least the next 2-3 years given the current US policies. • Strength in the US cycle, with volume and especially price holding in much better than expected, and providing hope that pricing is arguably more resilient than investors expected

• Upside on earnings in 2026 and beyond, in particular with tariff mitigation to eventually set in; the tariffs also reinforced the sustainability of share for US players • And in the case of GM, the benefit of share buybacks 16 January 2026 2 Barclays | U.S. Autos & Mobility Yet the other dynamics we’d cite on OEMs is that the pendulum has swung away from concerns on long-term secular prospects, and instead favoring near-term earnings and cash flow dynamics.

Indeed, we’d argue the long-term secular prospects for US OEMs is somewhat cloudier today than it was a year ago. The path to making money on EVs is increasingly unclear, and the recent significant EV impairments by Ford and GM reflect the capital inefficiency of the auto business. Similarly, amid the rise of Tesla and Waymo in autonomous driving, the prospects of Ford, GM and the other OEMs in AV is unclear – a point most significantly marked by GM’s move to end Cruise late in 2024 after ~$10bn was spent over the prior decade. Yet these points don’t seem to matter. The market is increasingly emphasizing a favorable EV regulatory environment, a solid cycle, and the protection of the US market from Chinese OEMs – a contrast vs Europe.

We’d argue this has established the case for a multiple re-rating – a point we’ve long argued for Ford and especially GM. As we’ve noted with GM (3Q recap here) – while it has half the volume it once had, its profit today is higher than peak profit pre-COVID…and ex tariffs and EV/AV losses, GM earnings could be north of $20bn…more than 50% ahead of pre-COVID peak earnings. Accordingly with an easing EV environment and supportive cycle, maybe the OEMs are finally getting the long deserved multiple re-rating…even in the face of tariffs. FIGURE 2.

Suppliers – sometimes there is such a thing as too cheap With the exception of MBLY, nearly all suppliers posted strong performance in ’25, with the other suppliers in our coverage up 33% on average vs SPX +16%, and with stock performance ranging from +7% (VC) all the way to north of +100% (DAN). While positive LVP revisions over the course of the year were helpful for suppliers, we believe the big story on supplier stocks in ’25 was on trading multiples, which recovered from deeply depressed levels in ’24. In fact, most suppliers were muted on earnings revisions over the course of the year, with multiples largely driving the outperformance. Taking a step back, supplier multiples in late ’24 were at multi-year lows related to a variety of factors:

• Challenging growth prospects, with broadly a no-growth environment: This reflected not only customer mix challenges, but also a weaker content story amid the rise of the EV Winter. And as a reminder, with the profit algorithm for suppliers driven by operating leverage on revenue growth, a no-growth environment on the surface implies no profit growth • Pressures in China: Most suppliers have anywhere from 15-30% of exposure to China. Yet China proved a pressure point in multiple ways – negative customer mix amid shift to domestic OEMs away from multinationals (suppliers underindexed to domestics), margin pressures in China, concerns of competition with China suppliers, and increased China exports pressuring supplier business in Europe • European structural overcapacity exacerbated by rise of China imports These questions are still in place, and suppliers still face a no-growth environment. Yet the market nevertheless has calmed on the concerns, with suppliers returning to historical trading multiples. 16 January 2026 4 Barclays | U.S. Autos & Mobility

We believe the relief arguably was a reflection from the market that even when there are secular concerns, sometimes there is such a thing as “too cheap”, with the market appreciating that earnings and cash flows today are real and deserve value. In particular, the market has looked at supplier stocks which can offer: • Margin strength even in the face of no growth • A strong capital allocation / capital return story • And preferably NA ICE exposure These points arguably explain why BWA and especially DAN performed so well in ’25. Lastly, to the point of “too cheap”, we believe ’25 was a reminder that the playbook for suppliers or any autos is that even when there are secular concerns, there is always a price at which a stock can be a buy – especially if there are earnings and cash flows today. We saw this with European OEMs in ’25 - even with the secular dynamics much worse and negative revisions, yet the stocks trading up.

Similarly, amongst suppliers we point to ADNT, which at the depths of the tariff concerns in April ’25 was trading at a deeply depressed ~3.2x FY1 EV/EBITDA multiple…yet the stock quickly rebounded, with the stock re-rating to a more normal ~4.5x multiple by late-August; and in that time the stock appreciated by nearly 140%.

Tesla Tesla stock was up only 11% in 2025, underperforming SPX (+16%) as well as others in the Mag7. Yet we believe this masks the broader story for Tesla, which was a sharp acceleration of narrative, with fundamentals increasingly irrelevant. To be clear, Tesla has always been disconnected from fundamentals. Yet the stock always at least directionally traded with fundamentals - when earnings got better, the stock traded up, and vice versa. Yet that dynamic changed in 2025. ’25 EPS estimates declined by ~50% over the course of the year, with volume down ~9% - reflecting the unwind of US EV policy and sharp declines in Europe. Yet the stock nevertheless outperformed, ending the year at a frothy ’26 PE multiple of ~205x.

What is perhaps more astonishing is the magnitude of Tesla’s market cap (~$1.5tn) alongside its frothy PE multiple (currently ~200x NTM PE). Indeed, Tesla is one of three companies in the US with a $100bn+ market cap and with a NTM PE ratio of 100x+ (with the other two companies being Palantir and Boeing). Leveraging the concept of AV industry expert Alex Roy, Tesla has benefited from “narrative command” on its efforts in AI – with Tesla clearly cast as a winner in the AI race, and reflecting narrative command on steroids. The stock accelerated heavily starting in Sep’25, benefiting from excitement about Tesla’s efforts in AV (robotaxi, FSD v14), with the AGM also a positive catalyst. Conversely, investor focus on the auto business (which accounts for nearly all of Tesla’s earnings today) has diminished heavily. 16 January 2026 6 Barclays | U.S. Autos & Mobility FIGURE 6.

We remind investors of Tesla’s unique trading dynamics (i.e. retail, options play, etc) – see our prior comments.

Rivian RIVN stock outperformed sharply in 2025, up 48% (vs SPX +16%). Similar to Tesla, we’d argue narrative outweighed fundamentals for RIVN. 2025 marked a year of weakening fundamentals. RIVN saw ’25 EBITDA estimates decline by 23% over the course of the year, with increased pressure relating to the unwind of US EV policy (end of EV tax credit, sharp reduction in regulatory credit revenue). And while RIVN posted some traction on reducing losses for R1, the question on path to R2 profitability remains. Yet we believe the stock’s outperformance reflected investor focus on the company’s prospects in software and service, with RIVN’s AV/AI Day last month reflecting how RIVN is well levered to these trends – i.e. “Everything’s Computer,” with investors looking for RIVN to establish its strength in the software defined vehicle (AV especially), and with hopes of further tech licensing deals to other automakers.

Lastly we believe the strength of narrative can be reflected in a fascinating observation – RIVN is one of two publicly traded companies in the US with a market cap of $10bn+ yet with NTM EBITDA losses of more than $1.5bn (the other company is Moderna). The point is – not many publicly traded companies are worth a lot despite significant losses. And we believe this dynamic for RIVN can best be explained by strength of its narrative. 16 January 2026 7 Barclays | U.S. Autos & Mobility https://live.barcap.com/go/publications/link?contentPubID=FC68da2b3acfc50d37efe58adc https://live.barcap.com/go/publications/link?contentPubID=FC693bca33b032542874da2743

Valuation Methodology: Using our probability weighted scenario analysis we generate our Equal Weight rating and $14 Price Target. We use a 8% discount rate (over 5 years) and a 20x Base Case EPS to determine the prices of our different cases.

Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Downside risks to our Equal Weight rating include: 1.) Continued margin pressure / cash burn amid a challenged ramp of production; 2.) Challenges to demand driving the need for price cuts; 3.) Incremental capital raises that drive dilution; 4.) Interest rates remaining higher-than-expected, pressuring stocks with long-dated narratives. Upside risks to our Equal Weight rating include: 1.) Larger than expected margin improvements following the upcoming rerate; 2.) Excitement around the R2 unveiling drawing positive interest to the stock; 3.) Improved EV sentiment in the near-term increasing the uptake of EV sales and demand; 4.) Rate cuts by the Fed driving stocks with long-dated narratives higher and easing the path to raise capital.

Valuation Methodology: We value TSLA using a probability-weighted scenario analysis of 2030, reflecting the potential binary outcomes for the stock. We forecast a model case, and then flex the results into bull/bear and uberbull/uberbear scenarios, each of which generating an independent earnings estimate. From there we assign an EPS multiple and discount rate, deriving a share price for each scenario. Finally, we assess the probability of each earnings / share price scenario under a base case, upside case, and downside case, generating a probability-weighted average target price under each case. This process, using a 4% discount rate (over 5 years) and a 67x base case EPS multiple, generates our Equal Weight rating and $350 price target.

Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Upside risks include: 1) Continuation of momentum-driven rally and broader AI/tech outperformance; 2) Announcements of breakthroughs in delivery of FSD and/or Dojo; 3) An earlier/ quicker-than-expected ramp of the Cybertruck; 4) An uptick in 4680 cell volume production progress Downside risks include: 1) Continued demand weakening that requires larger-than-expected incremental price cuts; 2) A longer-than-expected holding of interest rates and/or incremental rate increases by the Federal Reserve challenging the long-dated narratives of TSLA; 3) A sharp reversion of AI-related and tech stock outperformance; 4) Regulatory action towards TSLA Autopilot/FSD; 5) Increasing competition from EV offerings of legacy OEMs and fellow new-entrants creating TSLA share losses or prompting incremental price cuts

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes a ‘sustainable’, ‘ESG’, ‘green’, ‘climate-friendly’ or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a 16 January 2026 15 Barclays | U.S. Autos & Mobility

company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
