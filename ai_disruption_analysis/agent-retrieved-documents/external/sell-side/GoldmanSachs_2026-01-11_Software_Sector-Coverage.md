AMERICAS TECHNOLOGY: SOFTWARE

We assume coverage of the Software Sector and 12 additional stocks. We are constructive on AI adoption being a positive tailwind to the Software TAM over the next 5-10 years. Datapoints in any given year may be uneven as the ecosystem matures and as competition evolves; nonetheless, we expect signals on uptake will be more positive in 2026. For the infrastructure providers, we believe the key to stock outperformance will be realizing durable revenue growth and better gross margins, by building capacity that is fungible across customers and workloads, and via silicon diversi fi cation; Buy MSFT for Azure revenue revisions and call options on multiple vectors of AI adoption; and ORCL for improving visibility on capex and ahead of a trough in gross pro fi t growth. For the application providers, we introduce a framework to evaluate AI maturity, including stack replatforming, pace of organic and inorganic innovation, and monetization, with CRM (Buy) screening

well. Lastly, we believe outsized value will accrue in the agent orchestration layer that controls and governs agents across multiple vendors, and see NOW as well positioned.

We assume coverage of the Software sector and 12 additional companies. We are Buy rated on Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Snow fl ake and Navan. We are Neutral on CoreWeave, Figma, Intuit and Workday. We are Sell rated on Adobe and Datadog.

5-10 years. Although enterprise agentic adoption will likely be uneven and creates room for new competition, we believe signals on uptake will be net positive in 2026, and history suggests that software enablers will be able to capture a portion of the value that they create for customers. With Software sector performance now being mixed for several consecutive years, we take a view on what we see as the three primary stock-moving debates in the sector:

Debate #1: Who will convert an initial share of AI compute into a sustainable, n pro fi table business? We expect the next 3 years to be de fi ned by infrastructure software companies converting backlog to accelerating revenue, and pulling levers of optimization to maximize useful life from today's capex investments and drive gross margin up from <40% to 60%+, approaching scaled gross margins in the cloud business before the AI investment cycle. Comments from Microsoft, Oracle and CoreWeave suggest signi fi cant focus on capacity planning and cost e ffi ciencies, and demand signals continue to be positive as token intensity continues to go up. We are particularly bullish on Microsoft's ability to drive upside to Azure revenue in 2026 given its scale and thoughtfulness on business mix and we expect visibility into the mechanics of Oracle's gross pro fi t acceleration will improve (funding and capex through to contract recognition, with a trough in gross pro fi t growth in 2026E).

Debate #2: Will the application software layer be disintermediated? We expect n to see a heightened level of competition between yesterday's SaaS leaders, today's bespoke software providers such as Palantir, and the AI native companies that have enough proprietary IP to scale (i.e. more than simply an LLM wrapper). We believe competition is particularly elevated because a) the start of a new technology cycle lends itself to more build experimentation while the packaged software vendors mature their o ff erings; b) there is a cohort of companies from the 2020-2021 funding cycle (where VC funding was 2x above trend) that may have smaller moats; c) the classic system-of-record stack of database + human work fl ows + user interface is going to look di ff erent when repurposed for both humans and agents, creating a jump ball that requires meaningful tech replatforming from incumbents. We prefer to be selective in the app ecosystem, favoring companies that are further along in repurposing their

stacks, such as Salesforce, over Workday (Neutral, tech stack still evolving) and Adobe (Sell, growth accruing away from the high end). We also think Intuit has a good tech stack but its exposure to idiosyncratic risks in the tax market and the rates cycle keep us Neutral. We view Navan (Buy) and Figma (Neutral, look for contributions from new product cycles) as idiosyncratic share gain stories in travel/expense and design software respectively. Debate #3: Where will the value accrue in the Software stack? Our customer n conversations suggest that every vendor will have agents; as such, the value lies in agent and LLM orchestration that spans the infrastructure, platform and application 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

layers. This makes vertical integration more powerful than in the prior cloud cycle. We see Microsoft as a leader as it is already entrenched in enterprise work fl ows and is innovating with the Agent 365 orchestration layer and being able to arbitrate across LLMs; along with ServiceNow given its IP in work fl ow engines and its ability to take action across di ff erent systems of record. We also see the potential for Snow fl ake to capture outsized share as enterprises modernize their data estates, and given a heightened pace of product introductions. We are Sell rated on Datadog as our industry work suggests increased competition and heightened customer focus on budget optimization, in part catalyzed by new approaches to address AI observability.

We expect the Software TAM to get bigger as enterprise AI adoption goes up; we see AI functionality as an intrinsic part of the software value proposition, rather than a technology that reduces it. Simplistically, TAM can be viewed as a function of two things: value unlocked, expressed as productivity gains (the more value unlocked, the better for value capture by software vendors); and competition (the more competition, the more returns and margins get competed down to cost).

To be bullish on Software, an investor has to believe the amount of value ultimately unlocked will be greater than the impact from incremental competition - and we do. This is the inverse of what AI datapoints suggested in 2025, wherein the amount of value unlocked disappointed to the downside, and the amount of new entrants and competition surprised to the upside. (The S&P 500 Software Index was up 9% in 2025 vs. the S&P 500 Semis Index up 43% and S&P 500 up 15%). We believe both these two trends may reverse in the next 3 years: competition will likely moderate and there are more datapoints on quanti fi able AI revenue to Software companies.

To consider value unlocked at the highest level, we leverage the work of our GS economics team, which assumes a baseline gross 15% uplift to US labor productivity and GDP following full adoption, equivalent to $4½tn in economic value creation in today's dollars. The team arrives at this estimate by considering the amount of work that can be automated by speci fi c job category. In prior cycles, Software companies have captured between 10-25% of value created. The high end is consistent with industry pricing studies, including work presented in the book 'Monetizing Innovation' by Madhavan Ramanujam and studies measuring the value captured by software companies relative to the value unlocked at a macro level 1981-2012 (Exhibit 3). However, the low end is more consistent with feedback from industry participants, and may also be skewed by some companies embedding functionality for free to capture share or adoption, or by the potential for disruptive new entrants. Assuming 10% capture would drive a $450bn software TAM in today's dollars vs. a base of $1tr in 2025E (~$450bn

applications; ~$500bn infrastructure; ~$50bn in operating systems and enterprise LLMs, per Gartner). Assuming a base case of decelerating growth absent AI, then layering in a $450bn tailwind with a 3% in fl ation adjustment to calculate nominal dollars, suggests a Software TAM of $2.8tn in 2037, or about 30% larger. The 12-year CAGR would go from 7% to 9%. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 Exhibit 3: ~25% of private sector growth gains were captured by Software companies between 1981 and 2012 Source: Byrne et al. (2013), Oliner and Sichel (2000) , Federal Reserve Board, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research

Within this, we divide the Software TAM into 'sca ff olding' and 'agentic' at 2/3rds and 1/3rds of the TAM respectively. We expect incremental growth of the Software industry to be tied to enterprise AI, and the most tangible way we expect AI value to manifest is in agentic work fl ows. However, we do not see agents as being a binary outcome or turning on in any given year; rather, we expect to see incremental improvement in functionality (and thus productivity gains) over the next decade. We use our customer service math (Exhibits 8, 9, 10) as a ceiling as to the share of TAM that agents capture, as we believe these use cases when text based are the some of the best suited to AI (veri fi able, repeatable): at 100% adoption and 60% de fl ection, our pricing math suggests agents would represent 70% of the TAM. (We think voice-based customer service agents are likely still 12+ months away from being adopted in practice). We assume the median is in the middle at ~35% of the TAM, taking into account a distribution of use

cases that bene fi t from 0%-70%. Our 'sca ff olding' nomenclature comes from the Satya Nadella's November 2025 interview with Dylan Patel and Dwarkesh Patel and captures the idea that the rest of the software stack exists to enable the agents and humans that use it as infrastructure to create a new layer of agentic and human work fl ows. A key variable within this is how much of the pro fi t pool is captured by LLMs . This in turn will likely be a function of to what extent LLMs are di ff erentiated vs. commoditzed. As a starting point, we use the same rule of thumb above that the enabling technology captures between 10-25% of the value created, or $85bn - $210bn in 2037 in this scenario. This compares to Gartner's estimate of the enterprise LLM TAM at $5.7bn in 2024. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Estimated TAM expansion from AI Source: Gartner, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research

We adapt our Emerging Software framework from 2021 to re fl ect our learnings over the last 5 years, including ~12 months of AI-focused conversations on how the Software stack is evolving . Our key takeaway is that AI is an evolution of the Software TAM that ultimately makes the TAM bigger; rather than a vector that erodes the value that Software delivers to its end customers. Put simply, we recommend companies with clear competitive moats where AI likely raises the barrier to entry, with favorable 12-month stock set ups. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

- Exposure to Secular Growth: The most iconic companies in our footprint have 1. shown the ability to reinvent themselves across technology transitions: consider Microsoft, founded in 1975, harnessing multiple secular waves in personal computing, mobile computing and cloud computing. A meaningful part of our initiation is dedicated to discussing in what ways AI creates secular growth opportunities at each layer of the stack for today's software leaders. The clearest examples so far are in AI infrastructure compute. At the app layer, we are starting to see agents driving productivity gains for knowledge workers in customer service or coding; and with software taking share from the labor budget (as detailed above, our industry work suggests software companies typically capture 10-30% of the value or productivity gains they provide to customers). At the same time, AI is catalyzing an additional wave of cloud migrations as the cloud often enables better data estate hygiene: while many app categories such as CRM are more than 50% SaaS, our industry work suggests only about 1/3 of PaaS/IaaS workloads are hosted

in the cloud. Select assets at the Infrastructure layer are well positioned to bene fi t from both a heightened pace of cloud migrations and new value derived from AI functionality. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Technical Moat: The competitive narrative today is particularly challenging to parse: 2. There is a tranche of companies that were arguably overfunded in the o ZIRP era of 2020-2021 that are under pressure today due to their smaller technical moats. Our sense is these vendors are commonly cited as being displaced by larger platforms. We believe this extent dynamic is best illustrated by 'excess' VC software dollars relative to trend (illustrated in Debate #2); There is an in fl ux of new competition that largely falls into two categories: o frontier models, which didn't capture value in the pre-2023 software stack and now enable a custom-built software stack; and AI native software start-ups, which generally have lower cost bases and more dynamic tech stacks that bene fi t more directly from a lower cost of code (i.e. there is minimal technical debt in their stacks).

As such, a large part of our due diligence has been focused on understanding competitive moat in excess of the cost of replicating the code base: these moats include ecosystems built around a platform, data context that cannot easily be abstracted via APIs, network e ff ects, and scale. These moats cannot simply be eroded by the cost of coding software coming down; in fact, existing Software leaders with a focus on innovation will use today's AI technologies to transform their own tech stacks and compound their moats.

- Unit Economics: The average software company in our sample set has increased 3. gross pro fi t per employee by 35% 2025 vs. 2021, yet LTV:CAC benchmarking shows we are still well below pre-ZIRP highs. In addition, there is a risk that gross margins compress for many companies in the medium term before normalizing, because of dynamics like forward deployed engineers and driving AI adoption before monetization. This dynamic speaks to the importance of using AI to improve unit economics and as a litmus test for whether technical moat translates to pricing power. For software companies that are di ff erentiated, AI should be a tailwind to LTV:CAC and Rule of 40 measures. There are several examples of increased R&D and S&M productivity, and we believe that the ceiling for operating margin improvements is now higher. Competitive di ff erentiation will be the key factor to realizing these ceilings: gains realized uniformly across categories like customer service in competitive subsectors will likely be arbitraged away over time.

We then map these fundamental drivers into our fi nancial model drivers and overlay the medium-term stock set up. Speci fi cally, where does our quantitative and qualitative industry work suggest upside or downside to Street estimates over the next 12 months, and where is there a perception vs. reality disconnect? Our conclusions are summarized in Exhibit 2 above. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We take a selectively bullish stance on the providers of AI compute in our coverage: our view is shaped primarily by the extent to which providers can a) drive better unit economics on their IaaS businesses; and b) diversify their AI streams of revenue across customers and up the stack to include PaaS and SaaS. We are structurally positive on Microsoft as our industry discussions suggest it has the most fungible capex fl eet across customers and workloads, and several opportunities to monetize compute through more sophisticated Azure services and fi rst party use cases such as M365 Copilot. We are tactically positive on Oracle as we believe revenue will accelerate over the next 12 months, gross pro fi t growth will likely trough over the next 12 months before accelerating meaningfully, and visibility will improve into capex, fi nancing and long term competitive di ff erentiation. We are Neutral on CoreWeave as we believe the company is still early in adding more di ff erentiated software to complement their lead

in high-end AI compute.

In October 2025, our Econ team showed that the technological backdrop remains n supportive of AI capex for two reasons. First, AI applications are boosting productivity when deployed. Second, unlocking these productivity bene fi ts requires signi fi cant computational power, especially since models are increasing in size much more quickly than computation and energy costs are falling. In July 2025, our Semis team applied datapoints across the Fortune 500 to estimate n that approximately 14% of Fortune 500 costs could be highly exposed to AI automation through 2030. This cost reduction could unlock roughly $780 bn in NPV savings (tied to the period 2025-2030), delivering triple-digit returns at approximately $350 bn in aggregate AI capex (through 1H25). We believe the next phase of realizing returns on AI capex will in part hinge on enterprise AI adoption driving increasingly sophisticated types of productivity gains.

Demand signals will likely be positive over the next 12 months. Microsoft has commented that it expects to be supply constrained through at least June 2026; CoreWeave has commented that it believes the industry could be supply constrained through the end of the decade. We believe demand is particularly strong right now due to an uptick in query compute intensity for consumer models; for example, due to automatic switching between shallow and deep reasoning with ChatGPT 5, and due to the introduction of image generation tools like Google's Nano Banana and OpenAI's Sora. We also believe the demand curve for enterprise token usage for use cases like coding and customer service in fl ected in the last 12 months: for example, exiting 2024, Microsoft's GitHub copilot was at $500mn in ARR in a market less than $1bn; today the coding copilot market is closer to $5-6bn based on industry datapoints. Lastly, we believe the depth of the frontier model

provider market (our GS economics team counts >20 companies as leading frontier labs) is creating an arms race of sorts across more 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 than one geographic region, such that there is pressure to invest (and we have yet to see material signs of funding appetite waning.

We look for signals on when supply/demand could come back into balance. In a normalizing environment, we see the most direct positive catalyst to be to the application software providers, as the cost of AI compute embedded with AI applications will come down at a faster pace. We see the second cohort of bene fi ciaries as those IaaS providers that have the most diverse footprints across IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, as these providers will be able to capture newer pro fi t pools tied to the evolution of AI up the stack. For companies with outsized exposure to bare metal compute, the key will be to what extent gross margins can be maintained, for example through selling more di ff erentiated PaaS on top of bare metal GPUs (e.g. moving up the stack into software-di ff erentiated AI services has been a priority for CoreWeave M&A and DigitalOcean's organic roadmap). Many companies have guaranteed customer commitments through 2030,

but we believe the potential for renewing customer contracts post 2030 in an era of oversupply or normalized supply/demand at lower gross pro fi t dollars goes up. Factors to watch: The magnitude of capex revisions slowing down; OpenAI monthly active users slowing (we see this as a proxy for one half of the equation for volume of tokens, with the other half being token intensity).

low end is based on Oracle's disclosures of 30-40% gross margin over the life of a contract, which we then independently verify with our detailed forecast for kit and non-kit, builds vs. leases and depreciation waterfall. The high end is based on our calculation of implied headwind from Microsoft Azure AI on the aggregate Microsoft Cloud disclosed gross margin, which suggest that Azure AI gross margins are <40% range today (albeit including puts and takes tied to the OpenAI revshare) and will therefore be higher over the 5-6 year GPU lifetime, but likely below Azure general purpose compute margins, which we estimate are at ~65-70%.

Capex e ffi ciencies from new heating, cooling, and compute management 1. technologies; for example, CoreWeave is able to realize up to 20% higher GPU rental pricing per dollar of GPU procured because of its reliability and lower failure rate. Microsoft discusses its level of technology innovation in its new Fairwater datacenter campuses and its ability to drive token throughput per GPU up 30% qoq in September 2025 for ChatGPT 4.1 and 5; Capex fungibility : Microsoft, Oracle and CoreWeave each emphasize the 2. importance of being able to use their fl eets for multiple use cases (training, inference) and multiple customers; this dynamic will be key to mitigating customer concentration risk in the event any one of the large model providers have growth challenges;

GPU depreciation cycles holding at 5-6 years despite new generation GPUs being 3. delivered on a 1-2 year cadence. Recall that CoreWeave renewed a H100 contract in 3Q25 at within 5% of its original pricing, despite several more powerful GPUs having been introduced since 2022. Our industry work suggests many customer commitments for 5-6 years already take into account nuanced workload downshifting plans, such that the risk to the IaaS provider for these types of 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Diversi fi cation at the silicon level will also be key. Currently, Nvidia has ~95% share of the GPU market (and ~85% of the entire accelerator market) compared to Intel at 70% unit share of the CPU market(vs. >90% CPU share in 2015 Exhibit 12). We use market share as a proxy for buyer-supplier power: in other words, higher market share typically commands more pricing power, which manifests as lower gross margin to the IaaS provider. Our Semis team believes merchant solutions will retain the majority share of AI accelerators for the foreseeable future driven by (1) a rapidly evolving AI model development landscape which prioritizes fl exibility and optimization of model training; (2) the premium which AI developers currently place on high-performance solutions to the exclusion of others factors; (3) a far more widespread and mature developer/software ecosystem for merchant solutions. With this context, we note the following paths to diversi fi cation:

Custom ASICs developed by hyperscalers are addressing speci fi c workload and n cost optimization needs. This includes Google TPUs, Amazon Trainium, Microsoft Maia and Meta MTIA. Although traditionally ustom ASICs have been best suited for internal workloads, we have seen examples (such as Apple and Databricks) leveraging custom silicon from Google and Amazon. As a point of comparison, Microsoft has commented on successfully diversifying its CPU share with its Cobalt ARM-based CPU, which debuted in 2023 and was implemented in production workloads in 2024. Liftr Insights third party observability tooling suggests that Cobalt was behind 33% of new Azure VMs in 4Q24.

More customers are choosing AMD as a second source provider , including n OpenAI's strategic partnership announcement in October for 6GW of AMD Instinct GPUs, beginning with the MI450 series in 2H26. Our Semis team models AMD's GPU share expanding from 5% in 2025 to 8% in 2028. In our meeting with Scott Guthrie, EVP of Cloud and AI, at Microsoft Ignite in November 2025, Microsoft noted it is already diversifying its GPU supplier base and expects this to have a favorable impact on pricing into 2026.

Specialized solutions like Groq's LPUs are proving highly e ff ective for inference. n Groq has emerged as a challenger, particularly in the realm of AI inference. Its Language Processing Unit (LPU) is built for LLM inference, o ff ering speed and e ffi ciency advantages over traditional GPUs for these speci fi c tasks. Groq's LPUs are designed to prioritize sequential processing, enhance compute density, and optimize memory bandwidth, which minimizes ine ffi ciencies and maximizes throughput for LLM inference. The company claims its chips can run LLM models up to ten times faster and use a tenth of the energy compared to current alternatives for inference. This chip uses 1/3 of the energy per token of a GPU and Groq believes that over a 3 year period the chips would break even with the energy costs alone of an NVIDIA GPU. Groq is able to do this in part by using shorter, thinner wires which results in less energy expenditure as data moves through

the chips. In December 2025, it was reported that NVIDIA is buying assets from Groq for $20bn, with the goal of integrating Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

New entrants are leading to an acute rise in competition, against a backdrop of incumbents that vary in their competitive positioning: while many SaaS companies today are entrenched in their respective work fl ows, there are also some that may be less defensible. We focus our competitive comments here on the application layer, as we believe this is where the greatest competitive noise is. Consistent with prior technology cycles, there is currently an in fl ection of new entrants in the AI application space, in turn supported by VC funding. We believe the competitive pressure is particularly acute this cycle because:

Work fl ows are being rewritten, and work fl ow domain experience is one of the key n di ff erentiators of today's SaaS leaders. The user interface is evolving, and user interface is a key building block of today's n SaaS stack. It is becoming easier to port data in and out of systems of record, reducing the n importance of data gravity. There is an open question on to what extent platform companies and LLMs come up n the stack to compete directly with application companies. There is a cohort of companies that were 'overfunded' in the ZIRP of 2019-2022 n that may have smaller moats.

Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Our primary takeaway from our industry conversations is that the success of agentic technology is not binary: adoption will be de fi ned by select use cases succeeding vs. many others failing. Several of our conversations suggest that the MIT study showing 95% of enterprise AI projects fail is actually a feature, not a bug, as experimentation is a precondition of success, and the technology continues to evolve rapidly. We note that Andrej Karpathy (AI researcher, founder of Eureka Labs, and part of the OpenAI founding team) has commented that agentic adoption will happen over the course of the next decade rather than any one year being 'the year of agents' as 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 engineers work to address today's de fi ciencies in accuracy and reliability.

There are three things that we learned in 2025 that help build our framework for assessing where today's SaaS leaders are with being able to capture share of the AI pro fi t pool:

A high pace of innovation is key to addressing agents, both organically and 1. inorganically. Organically, we would highlight HubSpot, which incorporated AI/ML into its o R&D organization as early as 2023. HubSpot formalized its AI development e ff orts into an AI Platform Solutions group, o ffi cially making AI one of its primary colors (de fi ned as a foundational building block). As such, HubSpot will have a centralized group for developing core AI functionality and integrations, while all other product/application groups will be able to leverage this functionality. HubSpot noted that there are several parallels in the types of work fl ows that can be automated across its di ff erent hubs, such as content generation for marketers (that would otherwise start with a blank sheet of paper) and content aggregation for sales (that would otherwise be aggregating information across a myriad of sources and documents).

Inorganically, we would highlight Salesforce, which announced 9 acquisitions in o 2025 (as well as replatforming their base stack in 2024). The old tech stack can evolve into the new tech stack and it may be easier to 2. start with an existing stack than to make a brand new stack backwards or 'human compatible'. The existing tech stack has the advantage of already capturing existing data (structured, unstructured and external) and being entrenched in human work fl ows. AI can then process broader context and unstructured data/external intent signals at a better pace than before. It may be easier to combine both fl ows when starting with the existing stack, rather than starting with the unstructured data captured by AI and going back and substituting or collecting structured data with the necessary context to make thoughtful decisions.

We do not believe the cost of code coming down changes the calculus 3. universally on build vs. buy, although we do expect to see some share capture by custom software in the enterprise. In our view, this is less a question about vibe coding and more a question on internal IT choosing to build enterprise-grade software in house because they believe they can do so at lower cost for better performance. This distills down to the classic question of insourcing vs. outsourcing: while the cost of building the software may go down, the cost and responsibility of maintaining it (even with agentic e ffi ciencies) will still compound over time. Even in a scenario where the cost of maintaining software applications internally goes down, it will also go down at the specialized providers, such that the performance to cost frontier at the specialized provider will generally always be ahead of the in house technology. We see the most likely custom software share capture in the space that falls between typical systems of record (back o ffi ce vs. front o ffi ce, and requires coordination across multiple business

units or teams that may not have been otherwise connected by packaged software). We look to better quantify how the 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 cost delta changes in an AI-enabled world to better illustrate this point in our future work.

opportunity : SaaS incumbents lack comprehensive AI functionality, AI natives typically only address a fraction of the broader enterprise problem, and many developers and IT professionals are still early in their learning curves of how to make AI projects successful. At the same time, organizations are having to face decades of sub-optimal data management practices, and compounding security and governance challenges associated with building software on poorly organized data. Each of these challenges should get easier to manage over time. SaaS incumbents will build in more AI functionality, AI native start-ups will broaden in scope (or be acquired by SaaS incumbents), developers will get smarter, data strategy will be cleaned up and security and governance will improve in concert.

We introduce a framework to assess AI maturity based on how far along a company is with replatforming, innovation and monetization, summarized below. Our industry conversations suggest progressing through the three stages typically takes about three years, and while we order the steps sequentially as a starting point based on what we observe in practice, in many cases companies may address steps in a di ff erent order. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Vertical integration matters more than in prior cycles. The Software industry has had a handful of large companies that span the infrastructure, platform and application layers and already realize the bene fi ts of vertical integration (for example, better unit economics). We believe vertical integration will matter more in the AI adoption cycle than in the cloud cycle:

Agents traverse the infrastructure, platform and application layers n indiscriminately, instantaneously and more holistically than humans. This means a good orchestration layer needs to span at least two layers of the stack. There is a role for software vendors to optimize across the new pieces of the AI n compute technology stack, such as accelerator processing units (which are a more meaningful piece of the pro fi t pool today and thus can drive meaningful savings via software optimization) and LLMs. For example, we see a scenario where software vendors can arbitrage to the best possible price/performance e ffi ciency frontier between LLMs by benchmarking LLMs for speci fi c use cases and enabling customers to switch out LLMs with minimal changes to their tech stacks. We see two pieces of the software stack that are well positioned to capture meaningful share of the agentic pro fi t pool:

Orchestration layer providers such as Microsoft, Alphabet (covered by Eric n Sheridan), ServiceNow, and Palantir Data platform providers such as Databricks and Snow fl ake n

We believe one of the key limiting factors for AI adoption in the enterprise today is the lack of high quality, well organized data as a key input for AI applications - and conversely, improving the quality of the data estate creates a secular tailwind for next-gen data enablers. Many of our industry conversations suggest a heightened push around data clean up in 2024 and 2025, but our sense is that this is still a limiting factor to adoption because of the challenges with connecting disparate pools of business operations data into a data warehouse, and a singular organizing and governance layer that sits on top of the data warehouse (we simplistically refer to this as the ontology layer, recognizing that there are more speci fi c technical nuances within this). Anecdotally, at the Databricks World Tour in NYC on Nov 13, Databricks estimated that only 40-50% of attendees were Databricks customers - which is illustrative in our view of many organizations not yet having adopted more sophisticated cloud data management tools. Corroborating this, at the database layer, 56% of the

RDBMS market is still on premise as of 2024 (Gartner). Access to talent is also a challenge: enterprises may have assembled AI data teams by pulling from the existing engineering organization (in which case teams are generally lean and/or pulled in multiple directions), or as a new team with a dedicated hiring e ff ort (in which case teams take time to understand the idiosyncrasies of their organization's data estate and org chart). The next challenge after cleaning up the data is fi guring out what to do with it, which in turn drives dynamics at the application layer (discussed above in Debate #2). 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Against this backdrop, Palantir has taken share because of their ability to solve the data aggregation and ontology challenge at the same time. Palantir's US commercial business has expanded from $335mn in 2022 to $1.4bn in 2025E, or at ~60% CAGR. More speci fi cally, Palantir's forward deployed engineers have specialized experience with aggregating and consolidating pools of data, and then mapping these real-world objects into a single view of the business in its ontology layer. Palantir is also very good at landing at reference design customers, building custom software, but then handing these blocks of custom software to its production development engineers who will streamline and generalize them, so they can be used at other customers within the same vertical. This process, coupled with pricing power, drives Palantir to benchmark at ~100 on the Rule of 40, well ahead of the top quartile companies in Software that benchmark at ~40. (Please see our technical deep dive here).

The ecosystem is standardizing around Iceberg tables , which reduces data gravity 1. and makes it easy to e ffi ciently query and manage data in cloud object storage, regardless of where the data is saved. For example, historically, to use Snow fl ake's database management software, customers also had to port the underlying data to Snow fl ake storage. Today, data stored in the Iceberg format in regular cloud storage buckets (such as S3) can be read and queried by Snow fl ake or any compute engine of choice. Recall that Databricks acquired Tabular for over $1bn in June 2024 in part to accelerate the compatibility gap between Iceberg and Databricks' proprietary Delta Lake technology; Tabular was founded by the creators of Apache Iceberg. Snow fl ake has disclosed that about 10% of its customers are using Iceberg today and our industry discussions suggest that enterprise IT teams are pushing for adoption given the fl exibility this gives them for AI projects.

It is becoming easier to vectorize data once it is organized in a modern data 2. warehouse. For example, at Oracle World in October 2025, Oracle noted that it has already taken private data and vectorized it to make it accessible to AI models, if a customer chooses to utilize their data in that way. Similarly, Snow fl ake and Databricks also o ff er native embedding services such that customers can bypass vectorizing at the database layer, and instead vectorize at the data warehouse layer. It is becoming easier to build an ontology layer. Application software companies 3. have invested in better integrations with the data layer, including Salesforce with Data 360 (which automatically enriches, labels and harmonizes customer-facing data before funneling it into Agentforce), and ServiceNow has introduced RaptorDB and Data Fabric to improve the speed of querying and processing for AI workloads. The pace of innovation at Snow fl ake and Databricks, in our view the two leading 4. data platform vendors, has picked up (detailed below).

The platform software layer has always been fragmented, and we expect multiple vendors to continue to win. For example, Snow fl ake and Databricks' run rate revenue combined is ~$9bn, which comprises less than 10% of the total DBMS TAM of ~$120bn. We believe a rising tide toward data platform modernization will lift several boats over the next 1 - 3 years. However, we also believe that switching cost is lower today because of Iceberg: data gravity or storage stickiness is no longer a reason to stay with or standardize on a speci fi c vendor. This increases the pressure to stay ahead of the competition, which could translate to greater R&D intensity or M&A intensity over the long run. It is unclear to us where the next point of greatest switching cost will be - we suspect it may be the governance or data organization layer, such as Unity Catalog for Databricks; or in the agentic orchestration layer and ontology layers directly (detailed below). It makes sense to us that Snow fl ake and Databricks are increasingly positioning themselves as being

a logical place to build and serve up agentic technology, putting them in more direct competition with the application companies. At the same time, SaaS vendors are starting to introduce product that sits in the platform domain where Snow fl ake and Databricks have traditionally operated. These SaaS data clouds are domain-speci fi c - they bundle storage, governance, and AI services directly in the application suite:

Salesforce Data 360 uses zero copy integration to connect and query data from tools n including other Salesforce clouds and third party datalakes, to create a comprehensive view of each customer. The zero-copy data federation provides near real-time access to external data supported by partnerships with Snow fl ake and Databricks. Workday introduced Workday Data Cloud: Workday partners with Salesforce, n Snow fl ake, and Databricks to provide customers with direct, two-way, zero-copy access to their core HR and fi nance data within these platforms. ServiceNow's RaptorDB is a Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) n database speci fi cally engineered for ServiceNow workloads. Based on PostgreSQL open-source standards and enhanced through ServiceNow's acquisition of Swarm64 in 2021 (a database software accelerator), RaptorDB serves as the foundational data layer to deliver faster work fl ow performance.

Over the next 3 years, we expect SaaS data clouds to complement Snow fl ake and Databricks, given enterprises use multiple SaaS apps and need a neutral platform of record to integrate across domains. SaaS vendors like Salesforce and Workday will capture value at the application and work fl ow layer, embedding vertical agents directly where business users already operate; Snow fl ake and Databricks will provide the governed, cross-domain data foundation and agent frameworks. Longer term, we expect the true competitive frontier to be where the value from building AI applications accrues: - to domain speci fi c agents within SaaS applications, abstracting the strategic value of n Snow fl ake and Databricks. In this scenario, data platforms would still power storage, integration, and vector search, but the value creation would move up the stack to SaaS vendors that own the end-user work fl ow. Data platforms would likely be more 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

commoditized infrastructure (similar to databases in the cloud era), especially given the commensurate rise of Iceberg standardization; or - to the 'agent platform', in which Snow fl ake and Databricks become the layer where n enterprises build AI agents. Agents would run on enterprise data in bespoke applications, rather than being hardwired into one SaaS domain. Consider a procurement agent that queries fi nance (Workday) and customer pipeline (Salesforce) in one fl ow - this would require a neutral data aggregation across SaaS silos. In this scenario, the data platforms would become the AI operating system.

Microsoft : Microsoft introduced Agent 365 in November 2025 and also has its n Foundry product to enable customers to build a combination of Microsoft-centric and DIY agentic stacks with centralized governance and reliability controls. Microsoft outperforms Google and OpenAI in M365 environments (unsurprisingly), change management, tooling integration speed, predictable pricing models and private networking. ServiceNow : ServiceNow's core IP allows it to build work fl ows across multiple n systems of record, and its Control Tower allows for centralized governance and management that is vendor/agent agnostic. In the security and observability space, ServiceNow announced the acquisition of Armis in December 2025. Palantir : Palantir builds custom ontology layers with best-in-class forward deployed n engineers and has been doing so for over a decade. Please see our tech deep dive here.

On OpenAI competition speci fi cally: our industry checks suggest that OpenAI has aggressively ramped its sales organization to target enterprise accounts for full stack agentic implementations. When we hosted OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar at the GS Communacopia & Technology conference, OpenAI commented that they believe the future of software applications will be custom, rather than packaged, because the cost of building software is coming down. We believe enterprise monetization is a strategic imperative for OpenAI, given the size of this TAM and its investment in S&M and R&D to date. Our conversations with system integrators suggest that OpenAI wins vs. Google AI and Microsoft AI on select functionality such as: tool integration speed, fast enterprise pilot paths for net-new custom apps, not charging an extra platform fee, and having low built-in trace friction for observability and logging. However, Microsoft and Google are ahead on most other criteria, including governance, change management, business rollout speed, enterprise operations readiness and private networking.

The pace of innovation at Snow fl ake and Databricks, in our view the two leading data platform vendors, has picked up . At one point in time, Snow fl ake and Databricks were partners: Snow fl ake focused on cloud-native data warehousing and SQL-driven analytics for business users, while Databricks provided a big data and machine learning platform for data scientists and engineers. Enterprises actively used both - Snow fl ake as the governed repository for structured/semi-structured data and BI, and Databricks as the processing and ML layer for unstructured and experimental workloads. With the launch of Delta Lake in 2019 (and the broader Lakehouse vision), Databricks moved directly into SQL analytics. At the same time, Snow fl ake expanded into data engineering (Snowpipe, Tasks, Streams) and data science (Snowpark). The two platforms began to market competing architectural visions: 1) Snow fl ake's Data Cloud: governed, enterprise-friendly platform for all workloads; and 2) Databricks' Lakehouse:

open, developerfi rst convergence of lake, warehouse, and AI. Snow fl ake and Databricks now compete across multiple fronts: analytics/BI, data engineering and real-time, ML & AI, applications, and transactions. Snow fl ake has signi fi cantly evolved its platform to manage diverse workloads and address the increasing demands of AI workloads by focusing on a uni fi ed, scalable, and cost-e ffi cient architecture, alongside the introduction of specialized AI/ML features and services.

Cloud Data Warehouse Founded by former Oracle data architects, Snow fl ake built a 1. cloud-native data warehouse that addressed the limitations of traditional on-prem systems. Snow fl ake pioneered a multi-cluster, shared-data architecture that separated storage (data in a central repository) from compute (queries run on dedicated, elastic virtual warehouses). This enabled users to scale computation independently from storage. The focus was primarily on BI and analytics queries, with early workloads including reporting/dashboards, batch analytics, and data consolidation across silos.

Data Collaboration In 2016, Snow fl ake introduced Snowpipe, a service for 2. continuously loading data from cloud storage, enabling real-time data ingestion. During this period, Snow fl ake also introduced support for semi-structured data - the introduction of the VARIANT data type allowed users to store and query semi-structured data (like JSON, Avro, and XML) within relational tables without prior transformation, bridging the gap between a traditional data warehouse and a data lake. In 2017, Snow fl ake launched its Data Sharing feature, allowing secure, instant sharing of live data between accounts (without copying or moving) - this evolved into the Data Marketplace by 2020, where providers could publish and consumers could access shared data sets. These e ff orts broadened workloads into data lake for analytics and a networked (and monetized) data exchange platform.

Data Engineering and ML The introduction of Snowpark in 2020 (which allows 3. developers to use familiar programming languages like Python, Java, and Scala to execute code directly within Snow fl ake) enabled more data-intensive applications and expanded the platform's use cases to include data engineering and machine learning. Application Development Snow fl ake introduced the Native Apps Framework, 4. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 enabling developers to build, distribute, and monetize applications within the Snow fl ake Data Cloud. The framework enabled applications to run within a consumer's Snow fl ake account, eliminating the need for data movement and enhancing data security and governance.

Unstructured Data & AI Snow fl ake expanded into AI and unstructured data with 5. support for documents, images, video, and vector embeddings, enhanced by Cortex Services for generative AI and RAG. Cortex AI o ff ers solutions across both a) agents & insights, with agent apps (Snow fl ake Intelligence), agent APIs (Cortex Agents), and multimodal AI-powered SQL (Cortex AISQL); b) processing & retrieval, with unstructured data retrieval (Cortex Search), structured data retrieval (Cortex Analyst), and document processing (Document AI, Parse, Embed); and c) data, with data connectors (Open fl ow), AI ready data and apps (via the Snow fl ake Marketplace), and multimodal data access.

Data Lifecycle All together, Snow fl ake aims to participate across the end to end 6. data lifecycle. Snow fl ake has taken steps to 1) unify data types - structured, semi-structured, and unstructured - under one governance architecture. Building upon prior momentum in Snowpark and Dynamic Tables, OpenFlow-following the acquisition of Datavolo-introduces a multimodal data ingestion fabric that enables seamless interoperability across both structured and unstructured data sources; 2) expand beyond analytics to support all major workloads: warehousing, data lake, engineering, data science and ML (Snowpark), transactional workloads (Unistore, Crunchy Data acquisition), and AI workloads (Cortex); 3) support secure collaboration with Data Sharing and the Data Marketplace, positioning itself as a network for governed data exchange; and 4) become a platform for application ecosystems through the Native Apps Framework - Cortex AI extends this further by infusing AI capabilities directly into the platform.

Databricks has also evolved its platform from a Spark-based analytics engine into a full data, analytics, and AI platform. Founded by the creators of Apache Spark, Databricks was built around Spark focused on creating a uni fi ed analytics engine for big data. It was focused on batch processing, ETL, and large-scale analytics across Hadoop and cloud storage, with workloads focused on data engineering and large-scale analytics. The introduction of Delta Lake and the Lakehouse architecture combined the governance and reliability of a warehouse with the fl exibility of a data lake - this allowed BI and SQL analytics to run natively on raw data. Databricks has increasingly positioned itself as a platform for building and operationalizing AI at scale, and in our view is Snow fl ake's biggest competitor. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Source: Company data Exhibit 22: Timeline of key technical innovations Source: Company data, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Our primary takeaway today is that both vendors have plenty of runway for growth over at least the next 3 years. Based on extrapolating our current understanding of strengths, weaknesses and roadmaps, we think Snow fl ake may have slightly weaker positioning to capture outsized share over the long term, because a) ML/AI workloads are likely to grow faster and ultimately comprise a larger portion of the data management TAM than data engineering/analyst work fl ows; b) Databricks made foundational decisions early on that position its architecture better for these types of 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

workloads, such that customers still view the platform as having a structural advantage in performance and/or cost over Snow fl ake; c) our industry conversations suggest that Snow fl ake has been incrementally less aggressive than Databricks with strategic M&A and organic investments over the last 5 years. Nonetheless, in our view Snow fl ake has made meaningful progress on closing the functionality gap with Databricks for ML/AI workloads and we believe a rising tide toward data platform modernization will lift several boats over the next 1 - 3 years. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We assume coverage of Adobe (ADBE) with a Sell rating (from Buy) and 14% downside to our 12-month price target of $290. Adobe has navigated many technology transitions successfully and has di ff erentiated IP and ecosystem ties across the content supply chain. That said, we see two challenges to Adobe's ability to sustain >10% growth over the next 3 years: 1) Adobe is competitively di ff erentiated at the high end, but a disproportionate amount of growth and new value generated in the market is at the low end, and the risk of the low end pressuring or limiting seat count at the high end is increasing; 2) the barrier to Adobe new user adoption is high: at the high end, feature-rich tools still carry a steep learning curve; at the low end, Adobe must o ff er something better or cheaper than alternatives such as Canva. We believe these dynamics are well understood with the stock trading at 16x 2027 GAAP EPS and Street estimates for NNARR already moderating from -1.1%% in F25 to

-4.5% in F26. That said, we believe we are only near the beginning of a multi-year secular headwind and expect the stock to be under pressure pending clearer signs of stabilization or in fl ection. We look to success with Express and Adobe establishing itself an orchestration layer across LLMs to become more positive. 1. AI is democratizing design, limiting growth in Adobe's core creative professionals base, while outsized bene fi ts accrue to casual creators and business users who can now 'short-cut' to medium-level creations.

The traditional value proposition of mastering Adobe's more technical tools is declining. For decades, Adobe's value proposition rested on a crucial dynamic: a high barrier to entry o ff set by a high return on technical pro fi ciency. The fl agship Creative Cloud suite (20+ apps) - Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, InDesign, After E ff ects, and others - o ff er industry-leading precision and control for creative professionals. The high-end creatives who invested years into building deep technical acumen were rewarded with higher-income, defensible skills, and meaningful economic return on their time invested towards learning these complex tools. Adobe has built its market-leading franchise around serving this high-end professional creative base, which today represents ~48% of Subscription Revenue and ~40mn Creative Cloud (CC) users. Creative Cloud also scaled on the back of an accretive business transition to the cloud, together with feature expansion and a broadening creative surface area across photography, design, video, and 3D.

With AI, the sources of value shifts away from monolithic, feature-rich tools toward fl exible, simple, and AI-grounded interfaces and work fl ows layers. As AI capabilities augment the need for complex feature-sets, the initial cost of learning Adobe's tools may no longer justify the value of mastering them. Tasks that previously required extensive training or multi-step work fl ows can sometimes be completed through natural-language prompts or AI-native tools with minimal prior knowledge. For example, upscaling an image which once required 5-6 steps in Photoshop can now be completed with a single click using Generative Upscale. The 'craft advantage' that Adobe's professional base spent decades accumulating may begin to erode over time. To be clear, we continue to see a material gap between AI-generated low-end outputs and high-end outputs from professional creatives, but these outputs will likely exist on a spectrum giving customers more options to trade o ff time, expense, and quality.

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 This translates to limited seat count growth at the high end. Adobe's most lucrative segment of CC power users will likely grow at a slower pace over the next 3 years than the prior 3, or even decline as the premium of technical mastery erodes, automation reduces paid work for professionals, and Gen AI enables lower-skilled users to perform select tasks previously protected by steep learning curves:

Illustrators and Concept Artists (relevant Adobe products: Illustrator, InDesign): n AI is replicating the styles and ideation process previously exclusive to skilled illustrators and concept artists. According to a Society and Authors Survey (2024), 26% of illustrators lost work due to AI, while 37% attributed income declines to AI tools. Graphic Designers (Illustrator): Graphic design, which involves highly task-based n and iterative work fl ows (e.g., resizing, color correction, and changing fonts), is increasingly becoming automated by AI. The WEF Future of Jobs Report forecasts graphic design as the 11 th fastest-declining job over the next fi ve years. On the other hand, UI/UX designers is forecasted as the 8 th fastest growth category, personas less core to Adobe and increasingly served by Figma.

Commercial Photographers (Photoshop, Lightroom): AI-generated photography n and editing are reducing the demand for traditional commercial shoots, where tasks like background replacement, lighting correction, and entire scene creation can now be completed through text-to-image or automated editing tools. More importantly, businesses realize signi fi cant cost savings by utilizing low-cost AI tools instead of commercial photographers that cost hundreds or thousands of dollars a day. Klarna reported $6mn in cost savings in image production by using GenAI tools, while an early 2025 survey from the Association of Photographers noted that 58% of its members have lost commissioned work to Gen AI services (vs. 21% in late 2024).

3D Modelers, Texture Artists, and Visual E ff ect Artists (Substance 3D, After n E ff ects): AI is reshaping some of the most labor-intensive segments of the animation and 3D pipeline within the gaming and entertainment industries. a16z Games' 2024 AI in Game Development Survey found that 70% of game studios are either using or planning to use AI for generating 3D assets (vs. 48% in 2023). Luminate Intelligence's 2025 Animation + AI report showed that 55% of entertainment workers believe that animators will face 'major impact' from AI within the next two years, while 50% believe the same will apply for visual e ff ects artists.

Video Editors / Compositors (Premiere Pro, After E ff ects): AI is automating many n post-production work fl ows such as dialogue clean-up, captioning, and basic visual composition that once required skilled professionals. In a 2024 CVL Economics Survey, 25% of entertainment executives believe that compositors' jobs will be vulnerable by 2026. 2. While the low-end creative market is a large and growing TAM, competition and low switching costs may limit Adobe's ability to capture meaningful share. While most enterprise software categories such as CRM, HCM, and ERP have steadily consolidated as these markets have matured, the creative-tools market has moved in the opposite direction. Over the past decade, it has simultaneously 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

bifurcated - between high-end professionals and low-end casual creators/business users - and fragmented with the rise of a fast-growing UI / UX design category. Adobe has been slower to respond to several pivotal shifts that re-shaped the modern creative landscape.

Web-native, real-time collaboration. New collaboration technology in the browser n resolved key friction points within the product development life cycle. Figma was able to capitalize upon this shift with a web-native, multi-player design environment and is now the industry standard for modern UI / UX development. Casual creators and business users seeking to create visuals with ease. For n non-professional users, traditional creative tools became so powerful and complex that they created a high barrier to entry. With a cloud-native, template-centric, and intuitive UI, Canva enabled 'design for non-designers.' Its drag-and-drop UI, browser accessibility, and built-in asset libraries signi fi cantly lowered the barrier to design, capturing millions of digital natives who wanted to make re fi ned visuals without technical knowledge.

Social media and the rise of creator economy. The rise of traditional social media n in the early 2010s drove a new creator economy (~67M global creators in '25 growing at ~10% CAGR, GSe). New platforms (e.g., TikTok), new formats within legacy platforms (Instagram Reels, YouTube shorts), and embedded editing tools shifted an increasing share of digital creation into the social platforms themselves. These formats reward speed, frequency, and accessibility, which favor simple, embedded, or mobile tools over Adobe's traditionally feature-rich applications.

Canva MAUs vs. Adobe DM Subscribers Source: Company data, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Adobe is investing in the low end of the creative market with Adobe Express, though adoption and growth has been uneven. Adobe Express (rebrand in 2021 from Adobe Spark, originally launched in 2016) was designed to serve non-professional creatives (like students, bloggers, and marketers) seeking simple, fast, visually polished outputs 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

without navigating the complexity of Creative Cloud. Express has scaled slower than category leaders like Canva: Canva captured mindshare of the digital native generation (1997-2012) early, building strong brand equity and a deeply intuitive UX years before Express achieved product coherence. Early versions of Spark/Express were fragmented (stitched suite of prior Spark applications Post, Slate, and Voice with a web version), lacked intuitiveness, and was viewed as a 'repackaged' version of Adobe's professional tools rather than a net-new product tailor made for non-creative professionals. Canva, meanwhile, harnessed a template-centric approach minimizing the 'blank canvas' dilemma, freemium model to drive mass adoption, intuitive UX for frictionless onboarding, and one-click content sharing to drive user engagement - factors we believe Adobe overlooked at the onset.

Express is making progress, we look for further signs of success. For the fi rst few years, Express saw limited product evolution, with most updated focused on incremental UI and feature improvements. Express product enhancements were modest between 2021 - 2023, with most innovations focusing on incremental UI and feature improvements (e.g., added font/color palette recommendations in 2022). However, with the rise of GenAI and unveiling of Adobe's own di ff usion model Fire fl y in 2023, Express has garnered more momentum. For example, the new 2024 Express mobile app integrates Fire fl y deeply across the work fl ow, enabling text-to-image generation, generative fi ll, and text-to-template; drove signi fi cant MAU growth and user engagement (Exhibit 24, Exhibit 25). Further, the recently launched AI Assistant (beta) also o ff ers an attractive proposition for non-creative professionals involved within the content supply chain, whereby the new conversational

AI interface can be compelling to a new generation of AI-native users. We believe GenAI may give Express a leap forward in the product's innovation arc and opportunity to better capture the low end of the creative market.

base. Since 2022, Adobe has prioritized investments in Fire fl y, its integration into Express, and deepening its interconnectivity with the broader Creative Cloud ecosystem. This has simpli fi ed many work fl ows and enabled Adobe to broaden its footprint across business users (e.g., marketers), with 14K+ new organizations onboarded in F3Q25. However, this has also created a strategic tension: as Adobe works to catch up at the low end of the market, high-end professionals increasingly perceive that the company's investments are being diverted away from improving the deep, pro-grade tools they rely on. From our industry conversations, several noted that investment in Express - and the broader AI roadmap - are coming at the cost of enhancing the feature-rich Creative Cloud products that historically justi fi ed Adobe's premium pricing (+25-32% price increase since 2022). Even though the low end and GenAI likely represent Adobe's clearest

near-to-mid-term growth opportunity, the company is investing in a segment that has inherently lower switching costs, viral adoption loops, and prominent players like Canva. At the same time, leaning into the low end risks weakening Adobe's foothold within its long-standing professional user base, potentially eroding the retention and pricing power in core Creative Cloud business. Taken together, we view Adobe to be disproportionately exposed to the parts of the creative market that are growing the slowest, while the fastest-growing segments UI / UX designers, non-professional users, casual creators (e.g., social media 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Canva acquired A ffi nity in March 2024, which marked the company's fi rst push into the high-end creative market. A ffi nity - with A ffi nity Designer (vector-based design), A ffi nity Photo (advanced photo editing), and A ffi nity Publisher (page layouts) - comes closer to addressing Canva's feature gaps relative to Adobe's fl agship products (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), allowing Canva to target professional users within the latter's core user base. A ffi nity now o ff ers a comparable feature set for free (vs. $276-$414 per year for CC 'single apps').

Announcements from Canva World Tour 2025 suggest a broader strategic push across the content supply chain. Canva's new Creative Operating System uni fi es its Visual Suite, Canva AI, and platform into an end-to-end ecosystem for both creative and marketing work fl ows. Notable innovations included Video 2.0, which enables near-pro-grade video editing; Email Design, enabling users to create branded marketing emails with ease; Forms that quickly collects end-customer feedback into Canva Sheets that now integrates with an enhanced Canva Code; and Canva Grow, a one-stop campaign engine that helps marketing teams create, publish, and measure content performance across channels. Canva also introduced its Design Model, the fi rst model trained speci fi cally on design logic (structure, branding, hierarchy, etc.), ensuring on-brand creations across the Visual Suite. Together, these innovations signal Canva's investments not only to capture higher-end creative professionals but also to capture more pieces

of the content supply chain.

Figma also plans to capture more pieces of the creative value chain by expanding beyond UI / UX design into adjacent product development work fl ows. While Figma Design is already the industry leader in UI / UX design, the platform spans the product development lifecycle - ideation, design, development, shipping, and promotion. By consolidating these stages within one collaborative interface in the browser, Figma is capturing work fl ows that once required multiple tools and design-adjacent personas (developers, PMs, marketers, etc.). For example, Figma Draw introduced more advanced vector-editing and graphic manipulation capabilities, narrowing the feature gap with professional-grade tools like Adobe Illustrator. More importantly, Figma's strength lies within its centralized design system which is not only tightly integrated with downstream development but also the broader product suite. We believe this well-positions Figma to become the de facto standard across the product development lifecycle. This same foundation also enhances Figma Make, where AI-native

prompt-to-product capabilities leverage Figma's design systems, governance, and enterprise-grade controls to produce brand-consistent, production-ready outputs - capabilities that other AI-native tools lack. One industry expert we spoke with noted that most of the value still resides in design inspection and re fi nement rather than in code generation, and while AI-native tools can produce initial prototypes, the outputs are not production-ready. AI ultimately will bene fi t the designers by lowering the barrier to coding, not by replacing the design work that remains central to the product development lifecycle which happens within Figma. Source: Company data, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 - 3. What would make us more positive: Adobe's opportunity as a design orchestration layer

We believe the single biggest opportunity for Adobe is to become the uni fi ed interface or orchestration layer on top of a rapidly expanding universe of image di ff usion models. As the creative work fl ow fragments across specialized AI models each optimal for di ff erent styles, aesthetics, and use cases - value shifts away from any single model and toward the application layer that can abstract this complexity for users. Similar to our view in broader Software, we believe LLMs may begin to commoditize over the next 24 months. No single model can comprehensively meet the full spectrum of creative needs (Topaz Labs for upscaling, Veo for cinematic outputs, etc.), and the pace of new model releases makes it impractical for users to manually evaluate, compare, and switch between providers. Adobe's broadening ecosystem of 3P models (including recent additions of Comfy UI and Black Forest Labs), coupled with its commercially-safe Fire fl y model, present a unique opportunity. Fire fl y ensures commercial viability

and brand fi delity, while the openness to 3P models positions Adobe as a neutral interface through which creators can access, combine, and seamlessly toggle between the best-in-class models for each task. Adobe's unique advantage lies in the scale and depth of its creative portfolio that spans across photography, design, video, 3D, etc. By embedding AI model interoperability directly across this suite, Adobe can reinforce its hold on core creative professionals and capture the emerging generation of AI-natives.

3P Models Available on Adobe, Canva, and Figma Source: Data compiled by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Company data Secondly, Adobe has the scale needed to build custom AI models for enterprises. In addition to supporting 3P models, Adobe recently introduced Fire fl y Foundry - a managed service that enables businesses to work with Adobe to develop custom AI 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

models trained on their own brand assets and IP. Built on Adobe's family of commercially safe Fire fl y models, Foundry strengthens Adobe's position as a content supply chain platform, allowing customers to accelerate content production at scale while preserving brand fi delity and governance. While enterprise AI adoption remains early (we have spoken to some early adopters, but overall 2026 adoption will be key), Foundry could be the key to reducing key barriers by giving organizations a secure path to deploy AI-generated content optimized on their own data without comprising brand standards. We believe this can also position Adobe to accelerate adoption within marketing (Digital Experience) as well as Express across a broader base of business users.

We estimate that the global creative-professional workforce is around ~65M in 2025, earning an average wage of ~$47K (estimated based on applicable employment pro fi les from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and ILOSTAT), implying an aggregate 'creative labor market' of ~$3.1T. Hypothetically, if AI drives a 20% productivity gain across this pool by 2035, the value of those gains could total ~$617B. In our base-case scenario, taking into consideration Adobe's market positioning and competitive risks as well as industry conversations, we expect that Adobe could capture ~13-18% of that productivity uplift and is able to monetize ~10% of the captured value through upselling subscriptions or consumptive AI services, this could present a $6-12B revenue opportunity and 3-5% uplift to growth. The table below illustrates various scenarios in either Adobe's share of the

productivity uplift or monetizable opportunity, underscoring the structural leverage the company has if it positions itself as the UI for AI in creative work. That said, to become the orchestration layer for AI-native creators, we believe Adobe may still need to strengthen foundational layers: simplify its tooling, enable multi-user collaboration, and allowing work to fl ow freely across the suite.

(14% downside vs. 21% upside on average across our coverage). Our valuation methodology is based on GAAP P/E. We apply a 15x P/E multiple to Adobe's SNTM (Q5-Q8) earnings. We use the bottom quartile of our comp group which trades at 1.5x PEG which implies 15x P/E when applied to Q5-Q8 EPS growth rate of 10%. This is a ~50% discount to peers (median P/E multiple of 29x). We consider a broad comp group composed of technology companies with >$100B in enterprise value that have similar business models and fi nancial pro fi les to Adobe and can be valued on GAAP P/E. Relative to this peer group, Adobe o ff ers lower revenue growth of 10% NTM vs. peers at 11% and lower EPS growth of 10% NTM vs. peers at 18%. We recognize that many of the competitive dynamics we outline above are well understood and that the stock has made new lows on GAAP P/E valuation. That

said, we believe that using the bottom quartile PEG is warranted given the slower EPS growth and questions on the durability of its growth pro fi le. Speci fi cally, we see potential scenarios in which Adobe's EPS growth is further pressured if the company invests more around its AI initiatives, or if Adobe's revenue growth falls below 10% if the company loses its pricing leverage with the proliferation of AI tools and increased competitive pressure.

Adobe's opportunity as a design orchestration layer, detailed in Section 3 above n Faster AI momentum and revenue contribution. In F25, Adobe's AI-in fl uenced n ARR has exceeded one-third of the overall business while AIfi rst revenue accelerated throughout the year. At the same time, Generative Credit consumption in Creative Cloud, Fire fl y and Express has grown 3x QoQ as of F4Q25. If Adobe is able to sustain this momentum onward, scale net customer adds and user engagement at a faster clip than anticipated, this could translate into consumption-based revenue streams that are additive to revenue growth or drive upsell momentum into higher-priced SKUs across the install base. If Adobe is able to execute on its AI roadmap and become the design orchestration layer, we can see a more viable path for durable double-digit ahead.

Sustained pricing leverage across creative professionals. We assume that Adobe's n ability to take price in core Creative Cloud moderates as AI commoditizes parts of the creative work fl ow and competition intensi fi es. Historically, Adobe has successfully implemented price increases on Creative Cloud by enriching the features within the product suite, maintaining high pricing leverage with professional users. However, AI is enabling non-creative professionals to short-cut skills that required 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 high technical expertise, which may erode the pricing leverage that Adobe historically upheld. However, if Adobe is able to successfully upsell users via higher-valued AI capabilities, maintain low churn and stable or rising seat counts despite price increases, and expand seat penetration within enterprises for creative professionals, this could make us incrementally more positive.

- Success with Express. There are signs that Express is seeing more traction in the n past 12 months, based on our conversations at Adobe Max in 2025. If the competitive environment were to become less intense and new product innovations can enable Adobe to capture the mindshare of business users, we would become more positive on Adobe's positioning at the low end of the market. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We assume coverage of CoreWeave (CRWV) with a Neutral rating and 12% upside to our 12-month price target of $86. We believe CoreWeave's purpose-built architecture provides a signi fi cant competitive advantage against traditional hyperscalers and other neoclouds at the high end, and the AI compute industry remains supply constrained. We expect CoreWeave's ability to commit to large customizable deployments while maintaining its speed to market and reliability will continue to drive large deals. We are Neutral for two reasons: a) CoreWeave's positioning at the high end of the market requires best in class execution, including for factors and partners that CoreWeave cannot entirely control, creating a heightened degree of near-term volatility that is magni fi ed for equity holders because of CoreWeave's outsized debt (~6x net debt to TTM EBITDA as of 3Q25); b) CoreWeave is in the early stages

of building out its product strategy to expand up the stack beyond high-density compute, and these levers will be key to CoreWeave's long-term value proposition as the AI TAM diversi fi es beyond high density compute (e.g. towards inference).

- 1. CoreWeave's purpose-built architecture is a competitive di ff erentiator CoreWeave's architecture is a signi fi cant competitive advantage against traditional hyperscalers and other neoclouds, primarily due to its specialized focus on high-performance, GPU-accelerated workloads for AI and ML workloads. Founded in 2017 as Atlantic Crypto, the company initially focused on mining Ethereum using GPUs. Following the 2018 cryptocurrency crash, it pivoted in 2019 to rebrand as CoreWeave and leverage its deep GPU inventory in cloud computing infrastructure. As demand for AI/ML workloads grew, CoreWeave further specialized to become a purpose-built cloud provider for GPU-accelerated computing. This specialization was supported by a critical partnership with NVIDIA, including a $100mn investment from NVIDIA in April 2023, granting CoreWeave early access to cutting-edge GPUs like the H100, H200, GB200, and Blackwell series. CoreWeave has

rapidly scaled its infrastructure, from 3 data centers in 2022 to 41 data centers today, with 250k+ GPUs, ~590MW of active power, and ~2.9GW of contracted power. Beyond raw compute, CoreWeave is evolving into a comprehensive AI platform, o ff ering high-performance storage like CoreWeave AI Object Storage (CAIOS) and integrating developer tools and AI agent training capabilities.

This specialization translates into superior performance, cost e ffi ciency, and optimized infrastructure tailored for demanding AI tasks. CoreWeave competes with the following two cohorts: 1) Cloud hyperscalers including Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle - compared to these hyperscalers, CoreWeave holds ~1% market share; and 2) Neoclouds, which are pure-play GPU cloud providers. These can be further split between a) neocloud vendors including Crusoe and Nebius (where CoreWeave holds ~70% share); and b) 100+ emerging neoclouds (which generally have smaller amounts of capacity, some of which are white labeled). CoreWeave's architecture e ff ectively di ff erentiates from both competitor cohorts: - vs. hyperscalers: CoreWeave is solely focused on AI compute vs. hyperscalers who n need to balance priorities across their lines of business; for example, Microsoft has

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 discussed balancing its GPU allocations between third party customers vs. its own internal R&D and fi rst party apps. CoreWeave's data centers are purpose-built from the ground up for AI workloads, o ff ering bare-metal access to the latest NVIDIA GPUs. This eliminates the virtualization overhead common in hyperscaler environments, leading to superior and more predictable performance for demanding GPU-intensive tasks. Moreover, its strategic partnership with NVIDIA provides fast time to market for the newest GPUs.

- vs. neocloud giants: CoreWeave is unique among the emerging Neocloud peers in n its deployment of large scale GPUs for single customers (up to +100K GPUs). CoreWeave invests in a strong engineering base and proprietary solutions (such as observability) that have helped build its expertise in this area. Keeping large clusters of GPUs online for days at a time is a di ffi cult technical challenge, especially as the fi rst deployments of next-gen GPU clusters typically see higher failure rates. Our customer diligence emphasized CoreWeave's strong reliability vs. the downtime experienced with competitors, where they saw daily - if not hourly - failure rates. The failure of just one GPU can disrupt an entire training workload, causing hours of downtime, and these errors are compounded at scale. CoreWeave is able to minimize this level of disruption via the granular visibility it has into some of the largest deployments of next-generation

GPUs. In the MLPerf Training v5.0 benchmark, CoreWeave deployed an NVIDIA Blackwell GPU cluster with ~2500 Blackwell GPUs (39x larger than the next cluster submission) and completed the training benchmark over twice as fast as similarly sized GPU clusters using Hopper GPUs. Smaller scale peers do not have the technical expertise to run such complex workloads reliably - this results in up to 20% higher performance on CoreWeave vs. like-for-like GPU clusters from alternative providers, with at least 14% improvement in price-adjusted performance.

SemiAnalysis' ClusterMAX Rating System provides an independent benchmark for evaluating how cloud providers meet the demands of large-scale AI workloads. CoreWeave is the only provider to receive the Platinum tier, according to SemiAnalysis, excelling across security, price for value, technical expertise, reliability backed by clearly de fi ned SLAs, seamless managed Slurm/Kubernetes o ff ering, and best in class NCCL/RCCL networking performance. As a result, CoreWeave is able to command a higher price for managed slurm on Kubernetes clusters (by roughly 10-15%), per GPU-hr vs. their direct neocloud competition (i.e. Nebius, Fluidstack, Crusoe, and Together.ai), with pricing closer to the hyperscalers. Looking forward, SemiAnalysis expects CoreWeave to focus on providing on-demand instances, continuing to develop autoscaling features to support inference at

scale, and maintain the lead in reliability for rack-scale deployments. We provide a comprehensive overview of CoreWeave's results across SemiAnalysis' criteria below. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

The AI Compute industry remains supply-constrained as demand for large-scale training clusters continues to outpace the availability of advanced GPUs, 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 high-bandwidth networking, and power-dense data center capacity. Foundational model developers require tightly-coupled supercomputer-class infrastructure, which only a handful of providers can reliably deliver. For the reasons we detail above, CoreWeave screens as one of the best providers for these types of workloads. Despite pricing at the higher end of AI cloud service providers, CoreWeave has discussed anecdotally that customers have come back to CoreWeave after initially choosing a lower-priced cloud, given CoreWeave's reliability. In this supply-constrained environment, we expect CoreWeave's ability to commit to large customizable deployments while maintaining its speed to market and reliability will continue to drive large deals.

CoreWeave currently has $55.6bn of revenue backlog, with 60% tied to investment-grade customers and no single customer representing more than ~35%. We estimate that CoreWeave has 83%/56%/37% RPO coverage based on 2026/2027/2028 GSe revenue, assuming that RPO is spread evenly across the years (split between 24 month, 25-48 month, and 49+ RPO disclosures). While a portion of the remainder will likely be a function of adding net new customers, we also see opportunities from existing customers expanding contracted commitments (either because they need additional capacity or because of a new generation of chips) as well as CoreWeave's push into more on-demand, pay-as-you go agreements (discussed in more detail below). We also illustrate the potential breakdown of customer concentration based on announced deal values across large customers including Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta. We note that this breakdown is illustrative given the cadence and timing of revenue recognition may vary, but we believe it may be helpful for approximating customer concentration.

Source: Company data, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research CoreWeave's revenue model is based on long-term, committed take-or-pay contracts (95%+ of revenue), which are typically 3-5 years in duration . At contract signing, CoreWeave typically receives 15-25% of the Total Contract Value (TCV) up front with the remaining recognized ratably over the duration of the contract. CoreWeave leverages the upfront payment to purchase GPUs and other infrastructure components. The pre-payment sits within deferred revenue, while the company's Construction in Progress (CIP) CapEx metric signi fi es the costs related to GPUs before it goes live. The installation period typically takes 3-6 months. Once the infrastructure goes live, CoreWeave starts recognizing revenue on a ratable basis (ex. the upfront payment). With a 2.5 year cash payback period over their average 4-year contract length, CoreWeave 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

aims to drive visibility and a solid ROI pro fi le from such contracts. We consider an illustrative, 4 year contract (that assumes 60% residual value of the capex for the 2 years post contract), funded 15% organically/85% debt (at a 9% interest rate) - based on this contract structure, we estimate CoreWeave's IRR based on a variety of MOIC and EBITDA margin assumptions.

Shift to on demand revenue: In the medium term, we also expect CoreWeave to n expand into more on demand revenue - currently CoreWeave's revenue model remains heavily dominated by committed contracts (98% of revenue), with on-demand o ff erings still in early development stages. The company has yet to go through a meaningful end-of-contract cycle - as such, we expect the base of on-demand revenue to scale from current levels. As larger cohorts of customers move past committed contracts, there is likely to be a layering e ff ect to the company's on-demand revenue base. Customers are likely to use their infrastructure until the GPUs fail, which typically occurs beyond the typical GPU depreciation cycle of six years. After the committed term, we think it's likely that CoreWeave leverages its existing infrastructure for on-demand workloads. While there is a debate around the useful life of older generation chips, CoreWeave recently discussed re-contracting an H100 contract with an existing

customer within 5% of the original pricing. While this may be a function of the ongoing supply-constrained environment, we nonetheless view this as a positive datapoint on the persistent value of hardware and CoreWeave's ability to leverage its GPU base when contracts expire (either in new contracts or for on-demand use cases) at higher margins. Optimize asset utilization and deployment e ffi ciency: Strategies include reducing n the time from infrastructure deployment to revenue generation, ensuring high utilization rates of its GPU fl eet, and repurposing older GPU clusters for less demanding but still pro fi table inference workloads.

Illustrative $10bn, 4yr committed contract (with 60% residual value for 2yrs post contract), 85% debt funding at a 9% interest rate Source: Company data, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research - 3. Long-term view: what happens when supply/demand normalizes? While we expect CoreWeave to continue to win share of the AI compute market as supply remains constrained, we expect that more capacity coming online across a number of providers will drive the industry toward supply/demand equilibrium. As 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 supply/demand normalizes and as growth in the market may be weighted away from the high end, CoreWeave's platform strategy will become more important.

CoreWeave already integrates proprietary software to improve the performance of their con fi gured nodes and data center systems : 1) mission control, its cluster health management system providing real-time infrastructure visibility and automated lifecycle management for AI workloads; 2) SUNK, an orchestration system enabling improved identity federation, research segmentation, and large-scale AI workload management; and 3) CoreWeave Kubernetes Service (CKS), for managing distributed AI workloads with fl exibility. This year, CoreWeave has continued to innovate on the platform, adding AI Object Storage, a fully managed storage service designed speci fi cally for AI workloads; and zero egress migration, eliminating data transfer costs and providing real-time migration dashboards for multi-cloud AI development.

In addition to organic investment, CoreWeave is also actively acquiring specialized AI companies to vertically integrate capabilities across the AI development lifecycle , innovating up the software stack; including Weights & Biases, OpenPipe, Monolith, and Marimo. Weights & Biases (5/2025) enables end-to-end developer work fl ows, combining n infrastructure with tools for model iteration, experiment tracking, and inference to develop, deploy, and iterate AI faster. OpenPipe (9/2025) integration has created ServerlessRL, allowing customers to n fi ne-tune AI models on CoreWeave's platform. Marimo (10/2025) enables developers to move from experimentation to production n deployments and of Monolith AI (12/25) expands CoreWeave's platform into industrial applications.

We expect CoreWeave to continue to both organically invest and leverage acquisitions to move up the stack as it positions itself as a full-stack AI service provider addressing the entire AI development lifecycle, while maintaining its focus on purpose-built infrastructure for AI workloads.

We also believe CoreWeave's nascent software solutions can potentially be commercialized. CoreWeave does not currently commercialize its software tools as standalone products but instead integrates them into its infrastructure platform, monetizing through access to the full platform rather than discrete software sales. (For example, its observability software drives as much as a 20% increase in pricing given the higher reliability it drives). While we expect CoreWeave to prioritize scaling its total platform over monetizing incremental aspects in the medium term, longer term we think monetizing some of these tools can provide a growth lever that scales without incremental capex (thus improving unit economics.) In our view, CoreWeave's Mission Control and Observability is particularly unique in the market and thus could lend itself well to commercialization to ecosystem partners or customers that do not compete directly with CoreWeave. This is the backbone of CoreWeave's AI Cloud Platform, with capabilities including fully automated cluster lifecycle management, advanced cluster validation, proactive health monitoring, and rapid

We assume coverage with a Neutral rating and a 12-month price target of $86. Our valuation methodology is based on EV/EBIT to account for CoreWeave's capital intensity and elevated D&A. We apply a 20x multiple to CoreWeave's SNTM (Q5-Q8) EBIT, consistent with our broader coverage framework. This is a ~25% discount to CSPs, DCs, and high-growth hardware comps (at 27x) to account for execution risk from factors outside CoreWeave's control (such as the power shell installation that in 3Q25 drove a $100-200mn revenue push out into 2026), the overhang from CoreWeave needing to diversify its business model as the AI compute TAM evolves, and CoreWeave's elevated debt pro fi le (5.7x Debt/TTM EBITDA).

We assume coverage on Datadog with a Sell (from Buy) and 14% downside to our 12-month price target of $113. We view Datadog as one of the most complete platforms in Observability with a strong track record of delivering customer value, and the Observability TAM is fragmented so many companies can win. However, we expect 2026 to be a year where competition intensi fi es and customers are more focused on observability budget optimization, which is likely to pressure Datadog's fundamentals. Speci fi cally: 1) AI adoption drives an increase in data volume and cardinality (unique dimensions per signal), likely prompting customers to revisit their observability strategy; 2) competitors such as Grafana, Clickhouse and Chronosphere (pending acquisition by Palo Alto Networks) are increasingly focused on capturing share in observability by optimizing customer observability budgets, including via driving lower Datadog bills; we think CrowdStrike and Snow fl ake (announced plans to acquire Observe on 1/8) could also choose to compete more intensely; 3) our

industry conversations at AWS Reinvent in December 2025 suggest a heightened focus from Amazon to capture share of cloud observability budgets. Taken together, we expect the industry to evolve to a more de fl ationary architecture: Datadog will likely either have to innovate into a more e ffi cient tech stack and pricing model, or will capture less share. While we do not take a view on any particular quarter, we expect these dynamics to drive slowing revenue growth and increased opex or M&A intensity, and weigh on the stock's multiple.

Datadog spend at customers may go up before it goes down, and ultimately n settle at a level of spend that is a net positive tailwind. As existing Datadog customers adopt AI, their spend with Datadog goes up; this in turn catalyzes the push to optimize budgets. It is possible that the timing of our call is wrong, such that fundamentals outperform over the next several quarters before customers push to optimize; or that the compounding cohorts of customers that are growing neutralizes the headwind from customers that are optimizing in any given quarter. Illustratively, a 50% reduction in a bill that has already grown from $100 to $250 is still 25% growth vs. base.

Datadog's product lead may be large enough to still win vs. cheaper n competitors. Datadog's strengths across user interface, and go to market; coupled with its product strengths across traces, metrics and logs; position it as best of breed. Newer competitors may o ff er material cost savings, but customers may ultimately decide it is not worth the risk to go with a less established/lower scale or more fragmented tech stack, or a tech stack that requires more engineering resources to manage e ff ectively. This is particularly true for open-source o ff erings that shift the burden of management back to the customer. Datadog may pick up its pace of investment in S&M to increase the quantum of n NNARR in the model over the next 12-24 months, allowing the company to meet or exceed investor expectations for revenue growth, albeit at higher opex intensity. Stock trading action over the past several quarters for the sector suggest that investors value 1 pt of revenue growth more than 1 pt of margin expansion.

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 Datadog's share momentum could improve in Security . We estimate that n Datadog's current product set in Security e ff ectively doubled its TAM - from $20bn in Observability to $40bn including SIEM, Cloud and Application Security. The strategy is still early, and we think Datadog will need to show consistent traction before Security can be viewed a major driver of upside in the model. Datadog has advantages at the data layer, but the security market remains competitive, and the convergence between the Observability and security market introduces both opportunity and risk to the business. We believe SIEM is the most tangible opportunity: SIEM is fundamentally a log-centric, data-heavy product, and Datadog already has penetration in log ingestion, routing, and analytics. Many customers now expect Observability and security logs to live in a single work fl ow rather than in separate systems, which puts Datadog in a structurally advantaged position.

1. AI is catalyzing the next architectural evolution in the AI observability stack Observability has gone through several architectural shifts in the last 20 years, such that leading vendors struggle to maintain outsized market share over time because of the challenges with replatforming and maintaining a dynamic pricing model. This includes the initial market for infrastructure monitoring on prem; the shift to virtualization and log-centric search, alongside the expansion of the application observability market; the shift to microservices with the introduction of APMs and tracing; and innovations in storage and big data.

We believe AI is the next architectural shift because it is more telemetry intensive: customers generate more logs, traces and custom metrics per request. Speci fi cally: Datadog prices in part as a function of cardinality. Cardinality is the number of unique dimensions per signal. Cardinality goes up with GenAI because of the number of prompt variants, tool paths and model versions. At low scale, customers can use sampling to keep the budgets low. However, with AI, the errors become harder to fi nd because rare hallucinations matter and long-tail errors are important. This means that reducing sampling comes with disproportionate risk.

Shifts in architecture drive shifts in competition . Our conversations with ecosystem partners including at AWS Reinvent in 4Q25 suggest diversifying the stack to reduce budget is top of mind. This introduces new competition into the stack, many of which propose new technology to optimize observability budgets, bring parts of the budget in house using open source, and in some cases, reduce Datadog bills by over 50%. These competitors are typically grounded in technologies such as Prometheus (open source systems monitoring originally built at SoundCloud).

Chronosphere: Palo Alto announced its plans to acquire Chronosphere in December n 2025, the deal is expected to close in 1H26. Chronosphere is growing at over 100% at $160mn of ARR. Industry feedback suggests that Chronosphere is gaining share because of its strong controls on metrics cardinality, such that customers can realize signi fi cant savings on their observability bills. Chronosphere was founded in 2019 with a team of engineers from Uber. Grafana: Grafana was last valued at over $6bn, per its August 2025 press release. At n the time, it announced over >$250mn in ARR; in September 2025, it announced over $400mn in ARR, implying a ~50% yoy growth rate. Grafana is typically coupled with 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

an open source stack and does particularly well at mid market accounts that do not need the extra functionality that a best of breed solution like Datadog provides. Relative to Datadog, Grafana's user interface is weaker by requiring more expertise and manual work; if customers are willing to accept a more fragmented set of observability tools (and higher management cost as a result), total observability cost goes down. - Clickhouse -based observability: customers can choose to build their own n observability stacks, built on Clickhouse or other columnar databases. These solutions are orders of magnitude cheaper for log storage and querying, and process high-cardinality traces and events data at much lower cost.

Its back end is built on Humio, which was founded in 2016 and acquired in 2021. Our industry conversations suggest that EDR agents have historically been optimized for performance and observability 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 agents have historically been optimized for minimal overhead; CrowdStrike solves for both with its proprietary fi ltering technology that is both high performance and carries minimal compute overhead.

Datadog underperformed through part of 2025 primarily due to investor concern that OpenAI may reduce its level of spend. The concern surfaced in part due to a Clickhouse blog post in June 2025 that detailed a case study with OpenAI, which suggested that OpenAI could increasingly insource observability/monitoring or shift workloads to home-grown tooling, which would reduce its reliance on Datadog. There are also a number of open roles at OpenAI for building observability products. This was against a backdrop of large scale customers such as the hyperscalers having brought observability in house as their businesses scaled, and select instances of large customer churn like Shopify. At the same time, the quality of revenue tied to OpenAI can also be viewed to be lower quality: OpenAI's consumption is tied to AI-native workloads that are inherently bursty (e.g. model-training cycles, rapid scaling during new releases). This usage pattern is more exposed to cost-optimization cycles, similar to the broader observability pullback seen in 2022-2023.

Datadog's OpenAI revenue is a function of a committed minimum and overage in excess of this minimum. This is true for any Datadog customer, and we believe that the typical mix could be close to 85%/15% committed vs. overage, based on management comments. We believe the mix for OpenAI over the last 12 months was higher than the average customer's % overage given the pace at which OpenAI was growing. Datadog has noted that it renewed its contract with its largest customer at better unit economics in 4Q25, and it gave this customer better economics, consistent with any customer who chooses to buy from Datadog in larger scale. While Datadog has not commented about OpenAI speci fi cally, we believe the total $ amount from OpenAI to Datadog that is committed will likely go up in 2026, but this does not give us insight into the % of revenue that is beyond the committed minimum. Importantly, we believe that Datadog will guide based on the trajectory of OpenAI's current usage with an bu ff er for conservatism based on its historical guidance philosophy. This is a key factor in shaping our scenarios for

bear, base, and bull cases in 2026 (summarized below). 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We introduce a 12-month price target of $113 (14% downside vs. 21% upside on average across our coverage), based on 30x our SNTM uFCF estimate. Our target multiple of 30x is toward the low end of Datadog's infrastructure and security peers and a ~20% discount to the NTM median of ~37x. We believe a 20% discount is appropriate given the fragmented nature of the observability space that lends itself to more competition, and our view that competition is likely to be elevated over the next several quarters (and potentially years). For example, Zscaler trades at 30x 2027 FCF with similar growth (~20%) and margins (high 20s) to Datadog, with the primary delta vs. Datadog's multiple today being more mature competition in our view.

We assume coverage of Intuit (INTU) with a Neutral rating (from Buy) and 10% upside to our 12-month price target of $720. We are constructive on Intuit's AI strategy: its GenOS platform allows SMBs to build unique custom work fl ows to marry horizontal and vertical functionality, SMBs are least likely to turn to custom software builds for AI, and AI should drive productivity gains in use cases like tax and accounting because these work fl ow outputs are veri fi able. There are two dynamics that keep us neutral: 1) Intuit's execution in tax from season to season have been inconsistent. Our analysis suggests that Intuit has lost share in the DIY tax segment while it has been focused on converting its existing DIY users to its Assisted o ff ering; Intuit is now in an investment cycle for performance marketing and brick and mortar to compete more squarely with competition. Intuit's share loss has moderated in

2025 and we look to gauge whether this cycle's investments can drive better user growth or better mix shift. 2) We estimate that Intuit has about 20% exposure to the rates cycle via its Quick Books Capital and Credit Karma segments. We have limited visibility into the durability of growth in these two segments and believe fundamentals may fl uctuate with the rates cycle.

- 1. We are constructive on Intuit applying AI to its GBS segment We believe Intuit has increased its pace of product innovation to intersect the AI opportunity, with more recent updates including deepening product functionality with GenOS for low-code bespoke work fl ows and for the mid market, and an 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

improved turnaround plan for Mailchimp. Intuit's GBS segment consists primarily of QuickBooks, its accounting/payroll/payments tool for SMBs, and its Mailchimp acquisition for marketing (acquired in 2021 for $12bn). Intuit discloses two segments of QuickBooks: QuickBooks Online (22% of revenue, growing at 24%) QuickBooks Desktop (8%, growing 6%). Intuit also discloses Online Services, which includes Mailchimp (6%, growing 3%), Payroll (8%, growing 27%) and Money for Businesses (9%, growing 25%). We highlight the following key drivers for each GBS' segment:

Pricing & AI: Growth is a function of subscriber growth and pricing, which is the n bigger contributor to growth in any given year and also fl uctuates more. Subscriber growth is in the mid single digits given this product was originally launched in 2001; while we were unable to fi nd good correlations with macro indicators, subscriber growth does seem to track with the general health of the SMB ecosystem. On pricing, Intuit has been thoughtful about the timing and magnitude of pricing increases, including a 9%/15%/16% increase for Simple Start/Essentials/Plus announced mid 2025, which resulted in a step-up 1Q. Our industry pricing work suggests that driving productivity gains via AI will be key to the next phase of pricing power. For example, Intuit cites that its accounting agent saves users 12 hours per month, on average, with each of these hours being valued at $75. We estimate that this product could drive $900 of value per month, and if Intuit captures 10% of this

value, it would equate to a $90 increase in ARPU (compared to a base seat value of $52). Independent of SKU-speci fi c pricing increases, Intuit also bene fi ts from mix shift up towards higher tiers and from new customers coming onto higher tiers.

GenOS positions Intuit to expand into vertical-speci fi c work fl ows. Intuit formally n launched GenOS in 2023 post several quarters of streamlining its back end infrastructure. GenOS is the foundation for Intuit's AI-powered tools; it includes a dedicated AI development environment (GenStudio) and UX framework (GenUX) and leverages leading LLMs. The goal is to more quickly develop and iterate on new features. We view GenOS as a way for Intuit to leverage its existing horizontal applications into more custom and bespoke work fl ows - not to the extent where they encroach on vertical-speci fi c providers like ServiceTitan, but in a way that enables its existing customer base to derive more value from the platform. At the 2025 Investor Day, Intuit outlined $25bn+ TAM across four key verticals: Construction, Professional Services, Wholesale & Manufacturing, and Non-Pro fi t. The idea is to use agentic AI to automate traditional industry work fl ows using industry

domain-speci fi c knowledge, to create products like bidding tools, inventory management, project management, and industry-speci fi c fi nancial analysis which it historically would not have been able to o ff er pro fi tably. Upmarket strategy: Intuit has improved its product and go to market positioning n for the enterprise, and discloses mid market datapoints that include QBO Advanced (its premium SKU, ~5% of subscribers) and Intuit Enterprise Services (IES, we estimate ~$100mn - see Exhibit). Contract value is $27K on average, compared to $1.2K for the broader QBO segment. Consistent with other SMB-focused software companies, coming up market is an evolution, and we believe Intuit has iterated on 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

its strategy several times since they launched Advanced in 2018. We believe the near term potential is in the cohort of QBO customers who are on small business SKU but have the pro fi le of a mid market business; there is a 2x uplift when a business with multiple licenses consolidates them into one IES subscription. Although convincing a mid-market business to spend twice as much with Intuit will take selling, Intuit cites 300% ROI over 3 years with IES, with $30-50k saved vs a traditional ERP implementation. On go to market, Intuit reorganized its mid-market sales force in 2024, with a coverage salesperson and domain expert assigned to each account (domain experts also facilitate cross sell).

Mailchimp turnaround key. Mailchimp was acquired in September 2021 for $12bn, and has been the most challenged part of Intuit's business, having decelerated from 15% to

2% in FY25 (120bps drag to Intuit's FY25 revenue growth). FY25 net new revenue growth was negative despite Intuit exercising pricing levers, implying customer churn more than o ff set the tailwind from pricing. We believe the pace of innovation and competition in marketing technology has been high, with newer technologies like Klaviyo bene fi ting from a preferred status in the Shopify ecosystem. We outline Mailchimp's key challenges in Exhibit 53 - the turnaround plan includes balancing low end and high end functionality, scaling the go to market support teams, and focusing on mid market adoption where product/market/ fi t is better. Taken together with our broader industry work, our Mailchimp estimates are below the Street; but we view this as a less strategic part of the growth algorithm.

Payroll: positive leading indicators, long runway (8% of the business, growing 25% in FY25). We believe Payroll growth is sustainable given its level of underpenetration relative to Intuit's installed base, at 7% of the QuickBook base. At the 2025 Investor Day, management noted 18mm US workers were paid annually via QB Payroll, and that payroll penetration is 12pp higher for mid-market (which in turn is the faster growing cohort in QB at +40%). Simplistically, we see upside scenarios where the Payroll business becomes 3x to 7x bigger, with the low end based on Payroll approaching the size of the QBO business, and the high end based on Payroll penetration approaching QBO penetration (note the higher price point as revenue per MAU is ~$1000 vs. QBO at $439). Leveraging data from GS Data Works, we show App Downloads (79% correlated with MAUs on a 2-month lag) have been accelerating, and MAUs are 91% correlated

to QBO sub growth., leading us to believe that the payroll business is a key driver for QBO sub growth. There isn't enough of a history to correlate Workforce Management MAUs with Payroll revenue growth, but logically it should be related, and based on MAUs accelerating in during FY25 and the business accelerating from FY24 to FY25, a directional relationship is likely. MAUs have continued to accelerate to 40% y/y, which would imply user counts could actually accelerate medium term, though we do not model this in our base case. Directionally, MAUs accelerated in FY25 and revenue accelerated into FY25. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 Money for Businesses: similar to Payroll, Intuit classi fi es Money for Business within Online Services with minimal additional disclosures. There are two main subcomponents: Payments and QuickBooks Capital.

The payments business includes their GoPayment app (used at POS in conjunction with a card reader), receipt generation, transaction recording/matching into quickbooks, and automated payments. Based on our math, the bulk of the revenue generation is based on transaction volumes; we model volume (disclosed at their two most recent Analyst Days) multiplied by a net interchange fee of ~55bps (on our math). QuickBooks Capital generates revenue via net interest on the loans it holds and realized gains when it sells loans. Their loan volume was $3.6bn last year implying ~14% take rate. Given the limited disclosures for this line item it is di ffi cult to reconstruct a history. The total size of the US small business fi nancing market is ~$550bn/yr, implying very small penetration currently and room for future growth.

Intuit's Consumer business includes TurboTax (64%), Credit Karma (28%) and ProTax (8%). Intuit's consumer strategy is centered on a year-round 'system of intelligence' for consumers to manage their personal fi nance. The segment has grown at a 10% 10-year CAGR vs. GBS at 18%. Similar to the GBS segment, Consumer bene fi ts from large TAMs, complementary products that can be cross-sold, and a wealth of historical data that can be used to train AI models. We look to gauge to what extent Intuit can drive another year of good execution (e.g. better mix and share) through the tax season.

TurboTax: Stabilization of share trends and return on 2026 investment will be key We believe the key debate is to what extent Intuit is able to accelerate share gains into the Assisted market (where tax professionals assist consumers) because of AI functionality, and protect themselves from de fl ationary risk in the DIY market (where consumers do their taxes themselves). We believe applying AI to drive software share vs. labor in the assisted tax market is a very compelling use case, in part because of Intuit's existing credibility with a younger generation of fi lers, market share data already suggesting they are gaining share in assisted, and because the outputs are tightly bound and demonstrably veri fi able. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

The bear case centers on foundation models replicating domain expertise (tax prep, the tax code, audits, etc.) to complete taxes better than traditional rules-based programming, creating new competition in the assisted and DIY tax cohorts. Furthermore, a foundation model company could make their own AI tax solution accessible to their existing consumer base, where they already have strong distribution. As in other areas of application software, the ultimate equilibrium point of how AI shapes the app layer remains ucnlear. Nonetheless, we o ff er the following context:

Price: Investors see a risk with AI native products being able to o ff er solutions at n much lower price. In tax, free and low cost DIY alternatives have existed for years, and consumers continue to use assisted alternatives even though they cost more. On features , Intuit is itself using AI to improve their tax o ff ering to make tax a n 'done-for-you' experience, similar to the way it saves QuickBooks users time on accounting. AI-native startups would therefore need to replicate Intuit's existing domain strengths to achieve feature parity. Risk: Even if AI could potentially match convenience and price, consumers would n need to be sure that the risk of hallucinations and mistakes is truly minimal, and that downside risks (missing out on a refund, being audited) are compensated for via a guarantee.

Intuit's recent announcement with OpenAI ($100mn+ multi-year contract to n license OAI's models within GenOS and provide access to Intuit apps in ChatGPT) also protect them from de fl ation risk. The OpenAI deal will also enable ChatGPT's 100m+ users to access QuickBooks, Mailchimp, and Credit Karma. Though Intuit will be reaching customers through ChatGPT, customer data and the work fl ows will remain with Intuit. For example, a tax question can be asked through the ChatGPT interface, but the customer will be shown links to TurboTax's online fi ling website/local expert. Intuit has stated their preference for being agnostic about what channels they use to reach customers, so we view this partnership as similar to customer acquisition via Google Search. We see a scenario where AI-engine optimiziation lowers CAC vs. SEO.

2025 marked a shift in Intuit's execution in its tax business, post a disappointing 2022-2024. According to Intuit, 11 mn taxpayers who use assisted tax solutions (~13% of the total) switch their provider each year. A 2025 survey of 2,000 taxpayers by Talker Research (link) found that of the 63% who fi le their own taxes, more than half said they would consider hiring a tax professional within the next two years. The survey found younger respondents and those with more than one source of income are likelier to hire a tax preparer. Taken together, this means that the share opportunity grows over time as the Gen Z/gig worker cohorts become a larger share of US tax payers. We see the following factors as key to Intuit consistently surprising to the upside:

- Improving top-of-funnel marketing: Intuit has noted before that once a customer 1. is in the funnel, and is engaged with the right expert, there is an 82% conversion rate. The bigger variable has been at the top of the funnel. For example, 30% of assisted customers decide how they will get their taxes done before December 25th, and Intuit this year pulled forward advertising to earlier in the season. Similarly, TurboTax was not showing up in the 6mm Google searches for 'Tax professional near me', 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

despite the fact that >80% of US fi lers live within 10 miles of a TurboTax Pro. Filers are 5x more likely to covert when given a local option. Third, they were not su ffi ciently integrating Credit Karma with TurboTax, and enabled zero-click login for 70% of CK members (vs. 5% in 2024) which drove improved cross-sell (1pp contribution). Finally, Intuit said that they realized they had a brand awareness problem with consumers often associating them with DIY rather than assisted. They are gearing their marketing at fi xing that gap. There is more room for improvement on each factor as Intuit's marketing strategies and data analytics are further honed, and as brand awareness builds.

- Going on the o ff ense in DIY: Intuit lost share in DIY partly because H&R Block (HRB, n covered by George Tong) leaned more aggressively into paid search during the 2024 tax season. HRB noted on their 3Q24 call that paid volumes in the 2024 tax season grew 6%, and said that many of these fi lers were from TurboTax. Starting with the 2025 tax season, Intuit implemented GTM changes for DIY just as HRB became more deliberate with its marketing spend, driving share gains for Intuit (link). Another reason for the share losses in DIY was mis-execution. At their 2024 Investor Day, management noted they lost 1.6M low-income customers, due to an experience/value mismatch with a sizable price gap between Free and Deluxe o ff erings and confusing fi ling experience. With the kinks in the o ff ering worked out, pricing strategy better aligned, their closest competitor reducing focus on the low-ARPR channels, and the

IRS Direct File program e ff ectively shut down, DIY may see the right conditions to return to growth.

A few notes on mix: Part of the decline in DIY returns was normalization from COVID, when the volume of DIY fi lers increased related to stimulus checks. But part has been a deliberate move to drive growth for assisted returns which average 2.2x the revenue per return (ARPR). While industry mix has been stable over the last 3 years, TurboTax has increased assisted mix from <10% in FY19 to 21% in FY25. Ideally, TurboTax should be able to grow in both Assisted and DIY, as DIY may be a funnel for assisted. But even if the transition was 100% cannibalistic, and TurboTax e ff ectively shifted customers from DIY to Assisted on a 1-for-1 basis, this would still be accretive to revenues. We estimate that each 1pp of market share transfer from DIY to assisted equates to ~$125mn of revenue. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

However, if TurboTax is unable to back fi ll the top of the funnel and loses 'organic' share in DIY, this may impact long-term fundamentals. For every one assisted return TurboTax wins, they can lose at most 2.2 DIY returns. Based on our estimates, this occurred during FY22 and FY24 (See Exhibit 57) where Intuit saw ~$25mn/65bps mix headwinds to revenue in those years, but was able to realize 14% price (unit-weighted) in FY22 and 9% price in FY24. This trade-o ff has been getting better, with TurboTax able to grow Assisted returns by 700K last year while sacri fi cing 'only' 1.7MM returns - a 1.6x ratio which is accretive. We expect continued improvement into FY26, though this will require execution on GTM changes, as discussed previously. As we show in Exhibit 59, if all parts

of the model (mix, like-for-like price, and market share) all pull in the same direction, this can create signi fi cant upside for TurboTax. In an upside scenario with zero cannibalization (which we do not model in our base case), the segment would grow 15%, which would be the fastest growth since FY18.

Intuit acquired Credit Karma for $8.1bn in 2020, implying a 15x NTM EBIT multiple, or e ff ectively 8.5x FY25 EBIT. Many investors view Credit Karma as a low quality asset that primarily monetizes lead generation into fi nancial providers (credit cards, mortgages). We agree that the technical moat is lower and the business is more cyclical, with EBIT declining 22% from FY22 to FY24. However, the technology may be more di ff erentiated than investors appreciate. For example, the Lightbox engine gives lenders access to thousands of de-identi fi ed data points to allow lenders to make real-time, pre-approved credit o ff ers to Credit Karma members. Based on the company's disclosures, we calculate that CK's Credit Card/Personal Loan/Auto Insurance businesses grew 26%/45%/27% in FY25, which likely re fl ected some normalization from more stable interest rates/recovery o ff a weak 2023, but also re fl ects market share gains. The

more users Intuit is able to add to their ecosystem, the more useful their algorithms get. We also expect strong results in the near term given Credit Karma's strong correlations with our SMB tracker.

We introduce a 12 month price target of $720 (11% upside) applying a 27x multiple on our SNTM (Q5-Q8) EPS estimate. We consider a comp group of scaled application software peers. This comp group trades at 26x NTM EPS and 27.6x NTM FCF, with a median of 15% revenue growth and 17% EPS growth (NTM). Intuit o ff ers 15% revenue growth and 15% EPS growth; we believe the size of the TAM and the technology moat justify a multiple in line with the group despite ~10% lower EPS growth. Investors have typically been rewarded for buying the stock on pullbacks (e.g. a bad tax season, a poorly received acquisition, macro concerns), but the stock is +6% since the beginning of 2025 vs. application peers down 16% to 48%. On a 12 month time frame rolling forward in weekly increments, Intuit has historically outperformed the NDX 58% of the time, with particular out-performance during the dotcom bubble, through the GFC, in 2017-19, and during the rally o ff

the COVID bottom. Since 1990, Intuit has outperformed the NDX 79% of the time when the NDX is negative, but only outperforms 57% of the time when the NDX returns positive. This illustrates that Intuit has historically outperformed during both upswings and downturns, but is especially defensible in a downturn. Since the beginning of 2025, Intuit's NTM P/E multiple has compressed only 5% vs. the peer average of -17% (CRM -31% and WDAY -23%). 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We assume coverage on Oracle at Buy (from Neutral) with 27% upside to our 12 month price target of $240. We are positive on Oracle's technology advantage in AI compute workloads, and believe the company has the potential to gain share vs. the cloud cycle (backlog suggests ~25% share of new cloud revenue in 3 years from <10% today). The question then becomes the timing and unit economics associated with the capex build to support backlog being recognized as revenue. We are tactically positive on the stock as we believe visibility will improve over the next 12 months: 1) we expect revenue reacceleration over the course of this year as more tranches of the 1.2 GW Abilene data center come online; 2) we expect gross pro fi t to trough in the next 12 months, followed by meaningful acceleration, based on our bottom up build of fi xed and variable COGS; 3) we believe we are close to peak debt raises, as our build suggests Oracle can execute on its data center build with less than $80mn in debt raised

(consistent with management comments of <$100bn), of which $18bn has already been raised and a further $38bn is already anticipated. For Oracle to be an investment rather than a trade, we look to better gauge the sustainability of growth and pricing beyond 2030, as well as in its database and apps businesses (~30% of sales). At $190, we believe the market is already discounting Oracle/Street forecasts of $20 in FY30 in EPS, and we see a scenario where gross margin is below the Street this year ahead of acceleration. As such, we approach risk/reward for the stock by considering bear/base/bull scenarios that discounts OpenAI commitments by 100%/30%/0% to arrive at $10/$15/$25 of EPS or a 4:1 upside/downside skew when applying a 10x-25x range of P/E multiples.

Compute capacity turning on in OCI is likely to drive accelerating OCI revenue; 1. gross pro fi t growth is likely to trough in the next 12 months. Oracle's capex was up 200%+ in FY25 (ended May 2025) and is on track to be up 140%+ in FY26. While we do not have the exact mix between long-dated non-kit related assets (tied to data center land/power/cooling) and short-dated kit related assets (tied directly to compute and therefore revenue), we estimate that growth in kit is accelerating through the fi scal year. This likely translates to accelerating OCI revenue growth in CY26. While we believe this dynamic is somewhat understood (for example, Oracle raised FY26E capex by $15bn in its December earnings report and raised its FY27E revenue outlook by $4bn), we believe it is has been somewhat o ff set by mixed execution in any given quarter (e.g. Oracle missing in-quarter OCI revenue estimates but maintaining or raising its medium-term forecast). While we do not take

a view on any given quarter and we expect data center delays will continue to create headline risk, we expect the market to react favorably to backlog converting to revenue growth. Customer exposure is likely to be diversi fi ed: Existing AI OCI customers include: 2. OpenAI, Neospace, X AI, SoundHound AI, Suno, Luma AI, baseten, LiveKit, character.ai, and Modal. We expect continued customer diversi fi cation as the industry remains supply constrained and because OCI's wins with sophisticated technology customers such as OpenAI, X and Meta credentialize it in the frontier model space and in the enterprise. OCI has made several architectural decisions that 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

help it benchmark near the top of industry analysis (e.g. SemiAnalysis), which we detail below. Given the compute-intensity of training large models, microseconds of latency or percentages of bandwidth loss compound. OCI's fl at network, RoCE interconnect, and SmartNIC isolation work to deliver throughput, predictability, and linear scalability required by large-scale AI workloads. SemiAnalysis estimates that Oracle's optimized networking con fi guration enables up to a 20% capex advantage vs. neoclouds and a 5-10% capex advantage vs. hyperscalers.

We are likely close to peak debt raises: Capex in FY26E is $50bn and our model 3. contemplates total capex of $340bn (with no BYOC, FY25-FY30) - we estimate capex peaking in FY29 in accordance with the more material revenue ramp. While capex will continue to go up, we expect as capacity comes online and revenue ramps more materially Oracle will increasingly fund its capex organically, and thus debt raises are likely peaking. Our bull case model assumes total debt raised of ~$70bn, of which $18bn has been announced and another $38bn is being planned. Once we are through these tranches (which arguably are already expected by investors), we believe the pace of debt raises will go down.

BYOC puts and takes: Oracle has discussed fi nancing its growth through customers 4. bringing their own chips to be installed in Oracle data centers, which would reduce Oracle's upfront capex. We see several puts and takes to fi nancials in this business model: on the one hand, distributing the upfront investment risk back to the customer reduces pricing power and thus gross margins; on the other hand, GPU procurement is not necessarily a di ff erentiated business model (hardware resellers typically capture 10-20% gross margin). Our expert conversations suggest that BYOC is only likely to happen selectively (conversations with 10+ experts suggest '2' on a fi ve point scale of likelihood e.g. because of the challenges with SLAs); regardless, we would see any announcements as a positive for Oracle.

Value in the stack beyond infrastructure: The most durable software platforms will 5. need vectors to deliver value beyond the infrastructure layer as the AI ecosystem matures. Management forecasts OCI to be 75% of company revenue in 2030 and OCI will generate more pro fi t as it matures; however, we believe Oracle can deliver value at the platform and application layer as well: Database: Oracle's opportunity with its AI database and data platform is a. substantial, driven by its unique position as the custodian of enterprise data combined with strategic AI capabilities. Oracle remains a dominant player as a custodian of enterprise data, albeit at a lower market share (~15% in 2024 vs. ~40% in 2014). The Oracle AI Database 26ai architects AI into the core of data management, with Oracle AI Vector Search enabling customers to securely combine search for documents, images, and other unstructured data with search on private business data without moving or duplicating it. Oracle projects $20bn in AI Database and Data Platform revenues in FY30, a 50%+ CAGR from FY25.

Strategic SaaS: Oracle's SaaS o ff erings form an integrated suite of cloud b. applications designed for enterprise back-o ffi ce functions, including Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, HCM, EPM, and SCM. These applications share a common 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

data model that spans across core business applications, enabling customers to extract more business value from their adoption of multiple SaaS o ff erings. Oracle's success in the ERP market stems from its platform approach, strategic cloud migration advantages, and strong market positioning as one of the top three ERP providers globally. The company has leveraged its database legacy, acquisition strategy, and multi-product ecosystem to maintain competitive advantages in both mid-market and enterprise segments. Oracle is developing suites of integrated AI agent-based applications for ERP, EPM, supply chain, manufacturing, human resources, customer engagement, plus industry applications for healthcare, banking, utilities, retail, hospitality, and many other industries - we believe Oracle can leverage its incumbent SaaS customer base to drive increased adoption of its AI agents.

Oracle revenue GSe/other companies FactSet consensus estimates Source: FactSet, Company data, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research - 1. OCI is gaining share and its tech di ff erentiation makes this durable at least over the next 12 months

Oracle's cloud infrastructure business (OCI) is entering a period of hyper-growth fueled by the AI compute cycle, which we believe is in part driven by early technical choices in architecture. Oracle entered the cloud computing market in 2016, several years after rival hyperscalers (AWS in 2006, GCP in 2008, and Azure in 2010). While previously focused on expanding its enterprise software dominance, when cloud computing began to accelerate in the early 2010s Oracle recognized the opportunity in Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) tied to cloud computing. Despite being a late entrant, Oracle initially attracted customers by leveraging its expertise in databases, ERP systems, and enterprise application management to build a cloud to handle these complex applications. In 2023, OCI was $5.7bn in revenue vs. AWS at $91bn, Azure at $47bn, and GCP at $33bn - re fl ecting share gains, but from a smaller base.

With the boom of AI training workloads, OCI has hit an in fl ection point as the requirements of large-scale AI training align with OCI's existing architectural advantages. While Oracle's late entry into cloud computing was initially a competitive Exhibit 64: With gross pro fi t projected to ramp more materially in FY28-FY30 after a trough in the next 12 months Source: Company data, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

disadvantage, it also enabled Oracle to re fi ne OCI's architecture after observing the architectural and pricing limitations of existing hyperscalers: Oracle's earlier database technological advancements in fl uenced how it approached the OCI buildout. Oracle pioneered real application clusters (RAC) in the early 2000s to scale its database architecture. While traditional databases could only run on a single server (limiting performance and up time to that machine's capacity), RAC enabled multiple database instances to run on separate servers while sharing a single database, connected through a high-speed interconnect. This required Oracle to develop low-latency interconnects, remote direct memory access (RDMA) communication, and shared-storage architectures years before the cloud era - when Oracle later built OCI, it embedded these same principles into its foundation.

Also notable in Oracle's foundation is its 2009 acquisition of Sun Microsystems ($7.4bn), which gave it system-level engineering expertise across servers, CPUs, storage, networking, and operation systems. Sun was one of the earliest commercial adopters of In fi niBand: an implementation of RDMA as a high-throughput, low-latency interconnect technology used in HPC clusters and supercomputers. Oracle used this expertise in its Exadata database platform, using In fi niBand for ultra fast node-to-node database communication. This also informed OCI's use of RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), a modern, cloud-scale In fi ni-Band, when building its network fabric. Oracle was the fi rst major cloud provider to make RDMA standard across its infrastructure (rather than an HPC add-on).

- Flat network design: OCI's fl at Clos network eliminates the traditional three-tiered n hierarchy in which east-west tra ffi c between nodes often hit bottlenecks, especial for HPC or AI workloads that require massive inter-node communication. OCI's 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 architecture ensures each GPU server has an equal-cost, high-bandwidth path to every other node, with no oversubscription and minimal hop count. This enables uniform communication latency across an AI cluster, allowing large training jobs to scale linearly.

RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) Fabric: OCI's RoCEv2 fabric enables direct n memory-to-memory communication between GPUs across nodes by passing the CPU and kernel entirely. This reduces latency and boosts e ff ective bandwidth per node. Hardware-level network virtualization: OCI's o ff -box design means GPUs and n CPUs can use 100% of their cycles for training, while the SmartNIC handles networking and security functions independently.

Given the compute-intensity of training large models, microseconds of latency or percentages of bandwidth loss compound. OCI's fl at network, RoCE interconnect, and SmartNIC isolation work to deliver throughput, predictability, and linear scalability required by large-scale AI workloads. SemiAnalysis estimates that Oracle's optimized networking con fi guration enables up to a 20% capex advantage vs. neoclouds and a 5-10% capex advantage vs. hyperscalers. Oracle continues to invest in its architecture to optimize for AI workloads - at AI World in October, Oracle debuted its OCI Zettascale 10 supercluster, which delivers 16 zettaFLOPS within a multigigawatt cluster, spanning multiple data centers and integrating as many as 800k NVIDIA GPUs. These are tied together via Oracle's Acceleron RoCE network fabric, which uses specialized Ethernet NICs and cables to link GPUs within an OCI data center.

With the Acceleron network fabric, customers can leverage large AI clusters by connecting GPU NICs to multiple network switches simultaneously, thereby creating a fl atter network fabric with many isolated network planes, resulting in 2x the potential networking capacity, up to 2x the storage IOPS (input/output per second), and zero-trust packet routing security policies enforced directly at the host.

Source: Company data, Visible Alpha Consensus Data, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research - 2. Modeling out the data center build: solving for revenue via capex; solving for capex via debt Oracle announced a $300bn deal with OpenAI in August 2025, and provided an initial forecast for OCI to achieve $144bn in FY2030 revenue. This includes revenue tied to AI and classic cloud, as well as hosted database revenue. At its analyst day in 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

October, Oracle updated its forecasts to re fl ect an incremental $60bn in new deals signed between August and October, from four separate customers. Oracle's disclosed AI customers include Meta, X.ai, Neospace, SoundHound AI, and several others, as well as OpenAI. Oracle currently forecasts $166bn in OCI revenue in FY2030 , a 75% 5-year CAGR and OCI at 75% of total company revenue (vs. ~20% today). Supporting these targets, Oracle's RPO as of 2QFY26 was >$500bn, with ~$300bn tied to OpenAI.

To help inform our model forecasts and verify Oracle's target 30-40% gross margin over a 6 year contract lifetime, we build a detailed plan of capex and P&L costs. Our forecasts are based on our industry work across sectors, including conversations and analysis reconciliations with the GS Semis and Data Center teams. Our estimates are intended to be a starting point given the overall lack of visibility into Oracle speci fi c metrics.

- We start with Oracle's OCI forecast to arrive at implied net new revenue for FY26 1. through FY30. We split net new revenue into: a) Non AI net new revenue, which is 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 further split between i) database net new based on Oracle's long-term targets and ii) core OCI net new assuming 10% yoy growth; and b) AI net new revenue, which we back into based on total net new and non AI net new.

Next, we forecast capex on kit (GPUs, other compute, networking). We assume that 2. kit related capex (GPUs, CPUs, networking, storage) will be procured about 3 months before it comes online, recognizing that Oracle is taking steps to shorten this timeline and that it could be as low as a couple weeks. We drive our kit forecast o ff net new AI revenue. We assume the ratio of kit to net new AI revenue is 2.5x, based on CoreWeave's metrics, improving to 2x by FY28. Recall that CoreWeave's revenue yield on net fi xed assets is 40%. This capex estimate also informs our depreciation forecast. We assume that capex recurs every 6 years given a 6 year GPU useful life.

We model non kit related capex (land, power, cooling) based on the details Oracle 3. and its partners have already provided about its Stargate facilities. To date, disclosed costs suggest $14.50-$16.65 mn per megawatt of commissioned IT load, which compares to the industry average of $7-12 for classic data centers and up to $20 for AI datacenters. The annual cost to Oracle will be the cost of leasing and the variable cost of maintaining and operating the facilities; we assume 22% (12% from leasing and 10% from variable costs). Our 10% variable cost estimate back solves based on Oracle's gross margin disclosure and its kit to non kit disclosure (kit makes up 65% of total cost), and also reconciles with industry commentary and CoreWeave's disclosures.

We then forecast EBITDA and operating cash fl ow based on Oracle's historical 4. margins. We assume $10bn in cash is held on the balance sheet as a bu ff er (equivalent to about 2 quarters of opex). For the purpose of this analysis, we assume that any capex that cannot be funded by operating cash fl ow is funded by debt. We then estimate the cost of debt based on conversations with our Credit Strategy team (supported by analysis on typical cost of debt for software companies). Below we summarize what we know about Oracle's fi rst 5 data center sites, as well as the potential for Site 6, as well as our estimates for the timing on when non-kit related capex (land, building, power and cooling) is spent.

- There is enough information to verify that Oracle's gross margin target of 30-40% 1. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 over a 6-year contract lifetime is reasonable. The Abilene data center provides revenue coverage for Oracle's revenue forecast 2. through FY26 and part of FY27. Wisconsin provides additional coverage through FY27. Other Stargate projects including Shakleford and Santa Ana provide coverage through 2030. Oracle's net debt to EBITDA leverage peaks at <4x in FY26 or FY27 (excluding 3. operating leases). Taking our FY24-FY30 forecast in isolation (i.e. making no assumptions about FY31), Oracle would exit FY29 at 1.6x net debt to leverage. These ratios are well within investment grade based on agency baselines.

We estimate that 50%+ of Oracle's 2030 targeted revenue is tied to OpenAI, along with the vast majority of its datacenter commitments to be able to ultimately deliver capacity and recognize revenue. For illustrative purposes, we consider a scenario in which OpenAI's contracts are either more fl exible than a typical contract (i.e. revenues are achieved over a longer duration), or the resulting revenues are lower than expected. In this case, Oracle would still have to account for its own fi nancial obligations and fi xed costs: Long term leases for the 5 Stargate facilities: by our estimates, at a 12% annual cost n this would be ~$11bn in fi xed costs by FY29 The remaining term of the 6-year GPUs for any existing capacity that was allocated n toward OpenAI

Hypothetically, in a scenario where revenue from OpenAI goes to zero in a 2028 time-frame, we assume the costs tied to long term leases and existing depreciation GPU are fi xed, and that Oracle can somewhat grow into its GPU footprint with other customers (as OpenAI demand gets redistributed to other LLMs), but that this will take time. In this scenario, we expect Oracle's net debt to EBITDA ratio to go from ~3.5x in our base case (where OpenAI is discounted 30%) to 4x. We estimate Oracle would earn ~$10 in 2030 EPS in this scenario, growing EPS at an 10% CAGR from FY25. Applying a 15x P/E multiple and discounting back by 2.5 years (to be consistent with our SNTM framework) would imply ~35% downside to the current stock price. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Oracle is shifting to a more capital intensive business model in order to cement its market position in AI compute. To enable this shift, Oracle raised $18bn in debt in 2025 (o ff a base of $80bn) and plans to raise $38bn in the medium term. Oracle has commented that in aggregate, it can fund its OCI expansion plans with less than $100bn in new capital raises. The pace and scale of capital commitments coupled with outsized customer concentration with OpenAI is creating renewed focus on Oracle's creditworthiness. For example, Oracle's CDS has historically traded in line with CDX IG, but since 2Q earnings the spread has widened to 100bps+. While Oracle's 5YR CDS is approaching 150bps, and is now 100bps above the IG benchmark, we'd note that pricing 'only' 140bps above the risk free rate does not imply an outsized amount of credit risk. Moreover, when taking a closer look at the trading dynamics of Oracle's debt tranches, its highest YTW is

~7% - that is, debt investors are asking for a 200bp premium (vs. the

Purely for illustrative purposes, a YTW of ~7% for a 30 year instrument is similar to the average 30-year fi xed rate mortgage in the US being ~6.7% over the last 3 years.

A key debate on Oracle's investment strategy is whether these data centers will be fungible between types of workloads (training vs. inference) and types of customers (OpenAI vs. others). - Training involves optimizing a model's parameters to minimize error on a given n dataset, demanding substantial computational power for extensive matrix 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 multiplications, high compute throughput, and parallelism, and often requiring weeks or months of continuous operation. Consequently, training requires vast memory to store billions or trillions of parameters and intermediate results, typically scaling across distributed clusters and high-performance computing (HPC) environments, relying heavily on specialized hardware accelerators. Latency is generally not critical during training, as the process can span extended periods.

- AI inference is the execution phase where a trained model is deployed to make n predictions or decisions, with the primary objective of delivering fast predictions for real-world applications. While less computationally intensive per instance compared to training, inference often requires moderate computational power focused on real-time processing, and total compute usage can become extremely large at scale - thus while the cost per inference instance is lower, continuous operations can lead to substantial overall expenses leading to a focus on lowering costs per query. Inference can be deployed on a wider range of hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, and specialized edge devices, and can scale from edge devices to cloud systems. The critical distinction between inference and training is latency: low latency is paramount for inference, especially in real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, chatbots, and recommendation engines, often requiring sub-millisecond responses.

Oracle's current large-scale AI contracts are structured as take-or-pay contracts: customers are committed to multi-year commitments guaranteeing a fi xed minimum spend on OCI resources regardless of usage . Thus, regardless of whether a customer is at 2% or 100% utilization in a data center, revenue is consistent through the length of the contract once capacity is available to the customer. So over the length of these contracts, the question of fungibility is generally irrelevant. However, we note the delta between contract terms and lease terms: the Oracle/OpenAI $300bn contract is over fi ve years, while the contract leases are generally longer (for example, the Abilene, Texas data center is leased from Crusoe in a 15-year lease). The question then arises whether Oracle can transition its data centers currently optimized for training workloads to inference use cases in 2030 when its large-scale training contracts expire and it has 10 years remaining on its data center lease.

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 In our view, the biggest barriers to converting a data center from training to inference are: 1) latency - training clusters are built as centralized supercomputers, not for the low-latency, north-south access from users. A training campus in a remote region may have excellent internal networking, but the inherent network geography and user-proximity requirements make large training campuses structurally unsuited for latency-critical serving; and 2) cost optimization - training campuses are designed for maximum performance per watt, not minimum cost per query. Inference economics are focused on cost per token and can run on lower-cost, lower-power accelerators that deliver better throughput-per-dollar.

Oracle's comments indicate that they have been able to convert a data center from training workloads to inference workloads as quickly as one weekend (this is clearly a best case scenario). Thus, it is possible to transition these workloads - however, we recognize that there are still several unknowns on the long-term (2030+) ability of training-optimized campuses to fully support inference use cases given latency-sensitivity and a mismatch of cost optimization between performance per watt vs. cost per query.

We assume coverage with a Buy rating and a 12-month Price Target of $240. Our valuation methodology is based on non-GAAP P/E. We apply a 20x P/E multiple to Oracle's 2030 adjusted net income, discounted back to SNTM (Q5-Q8) to be consistent with our broader coverage framework. This implies a SNTM P/E multiple of 33x. We believe it is fair to give credit to Oracle out to 2030 given the business composition shift and period of hyper-growth it is entering as it delivers on signi fi cant backlog already contracted, though note that we are signi fi cantly below Street estimates (~25% below 2030 EPS) given we discount Oracle's targets by 30% to account for customer concentration risk and execution risk of data center buildouts. Nonetheless, our scenario analysis in Section 3 above indicates an attractive risk/reward skew.

Our comp group is made up of technology companies with gross margins in the 50-80% range (to account for our expectation of gross margin degradation ~20% between FY25 and FY30) and EPS growth ~5-20% (to account for GSe EPS CAGR ~20% from FY25-FY30). We apply a 20x multiple, which is a 20% discount to peers (median P/E multiple of 25x) to account for a) Oracle's EPS growth likely approaching the mid-20s vs. peers at 15%; more than o ff set by b) execution risk tied to data center build out timing, GPU cycles and pricing, energy costs, and mega-tenant concentration. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 We detail several of the key risks to the OpenAI contract in particular in our Bear n Case analysis above Risks to IaaS build out: The timing and execution of data center build-outs are a n signi fi cant risk, with potential delays due to supply chain disruptions, regulatory hurdles, or real estate challenges hindering expansion and capacity to meet growing demand. OCI's reliance on high-performance compute exposes it to GPU cycles and pricing volatility; shortages or signi fi cant cost increases for GPU could impact OCI's service delivery, cost structure, and competitive pricing. Escalating energy costs pose a threat given the energy intensity of these data centers. Signi fi cant customer concentration risk given OCI's revenue is currently highly levered to OpenAI, making it vulnerable to spending fl uctuations or potential churn.

Intense capex investment cycle: This cycle is expected to pressure FCF generation n to fi nance these large-scale investments, Oracle is resorting to external funding, often through issuing new debt, but this increased debt burden leads to higher interest expenses, further reducing net income and cash fl ow available for other purposes, and can potentially impact the company's credit rating and fi nancial fl exibility. Accelerating share losses in the database/SaaS market as hyperscalers and n pure-plays displace Oracle on-prem databases and SaaS solutions with cloud-native o ff erings 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We assume coverage of Salesforce (CRM) with a Buy and 27% upside to our 12 month price target of $330. Salesforce's vision with Agentforce outlines a future for agentic adoption in the front o ffi ce wherein AI functionality is a natural extension of existing technology strengths in Sales and Service. We expect Agentforce success to be the main driver of stock outperformance over the medium term, and therefore focus our analysis on this segment. Our industry conversations suggest that Salesforce's customer feedback loops are e ff ective and there is steady progress on some of the key limiting factors to Agentforce adoption. Rather than a binary view where Agentforce either works or doesn't, our base case is more nuanced: we expect to see a 4% tailwind to Platform and Other revenue over the next 12-18 months, which our bottom up build and Salesforce disclosures suggest will be enough to drive a revenue in fl ection as early as 2026. Over the FY26-FY30 time frame, we expect

that Agentforce will represent a 2% tailwind for the business in aggregate. Our view also takes into account ongoing share loss in Commerce and Marketing Cloud and evolving approaches to data architecture that impact Data 360 (formerly known as Data Cloud). Taken together, we see a positive risk/reward, and expect more consistent signs of momentum across the customer base through FY27 to catalyze stock outperformance.

Path to Agentforce adoption: As a starting point for quantifying growth, we 1. estimate that 20% of Salesforce customers in Sales/Service/Platform areas are showing interest in Agentforce, with 50% of those customers then moving on to a POC (10% of total customers), and then 25% of POC customers converting (2-3% of total customers). We expect Agentforce adoption to be gradual, and our base case assumes that this ramps from 2-3% of each segment (ex. Sales, Service, etc.) converting in FY26 to 13% of each segment converting in FY30. We assume that Agentforce adoption will be more straightforward for Sales/Service/Platform use cases vs. Marketing and Commerce - and that Marketing and Commerce Agentforce adoption lags the leading modules by 2 years. This results in ~40% penetration of Agentforce in Sales/Service/Platform respectively by 2030 and 17% penetration in Marketing and Commerce - re fl ecting our view that a signi fi cant portion of Salesforce customers will fi nd

value in adopting Agentforce, but that this is not a zero sum game, with a number of customers that will decide to adopt AI through di ff erent avenues. Monetization of Agentforce: In our base case we benchmark to a 25% contract 2. uplift from Agentforce in each segment (given each segment represents some portion of the overall ELA, which our industry conversations suggest typically sees a 20% uplift). We see this as a potential driver of upside as enterprises become more comfortable with expanding Agentforce use cases as the ROI continues to improve over time. This is particularly true in Service where our proprietary ROI builds suggest that Agents are capable of taking share of labor budgets (particularly for text-based use cases), expanding the TAM more quanti fi ably. Near term catalyst path: We expect improving sentiment around Agentforce in the 3. partner and customer ecosystem. Through our conversations, we heard optimism in 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

the ability for Agentforce to be adopted over time, as customers grapple with the associated costs, security concerns, and noise from other vendors, such that Salesforce provides a path of least resistance vs. other vendors. While enterprises will likely implement a variety of routes to incorporate agentic technology, most organizations are under pressure from C-suites to deliver, and we expect that Salesforce can capture share of this demand.

- FY2030 Model: Our base case for Agentforce is that it can ramp to $4bn in revenue 4. by FY30, implying that the rest of Salesforce's business has to grow at an 8% CAGR between FY26-FY30 in order for the company to reach the $60bn target in FY2030 (excluding Informatica). We believe this will be supported by a continued mix shift in growth contribution as Platform and Other revenue increases as a portion of overall revenue and Marketing and Commerce declines. As part of this, we believe that Platform and Other revenue will have to sustain a low-to-mid teens growth rate ex. Agentforce, which can be achieved through the continued ramp of Data 360 given that it is highly complementary to Agentforce.

Background: Salesforce introduced Agentforce in August 2024 as the next evolution of its front o ffi ce platform. Agentforce re-imagines core knowledge worker work fl ows with agentic augmentation to drive productivity improvements. Through our conversations with front o ffi ce disruptors such as Braze, Klaviyo, Sierra and Decagon, we have historically viewed Salesforce as having a high amount of technical debt (commensurate with key architectural decisions being made in the 2001-2005 time frame), with this being a limiting factor to agent performance (eg. accuracy and latency). However, today we do not believe that Salesforce's architecture is a meaningful limiting factor to Agentforce in Service and Sales for several reasons:

Salesforce underwent a signi fi cant technology replatforming prior to 2024, key n aspects of this are detailed here (Blog: The Salesforce Platform - Transformed for Tomorrow): Hyperforce (introduced in 2020) : This is the current generation of Salesforce's o infrastructure, and part of the transition from proprietary data centers to a globally distributed architecture on public clouds. Hyperforce is designed to meet customer needs for scale, global data residency, enhanced availability, security, and regulatory compliance across more than 20 regions worldwide.

Shift from monolithic to independent services: The move to independent o services aligns with microservices architecture principles, where application components are decoupled into small, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a speci fi c business function and can operate autonomously. This modularity allows for better code organization, easier maintenance, and the ability to update or replace individual services without a ff ecting the entire system. Importantly, the core of Salesforce's platform continues to run as a single system of record for application metadata. This includes a metadata framework which provides a stable abstraction layer for applications, allowing them to be built on evolving underlying technologies (Exhibit 75). 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

AI and Agentforce: Signi fi cant advancements in AI, including machine learning, n generative AI, and agentic experiences, are integrated into the platform. Agentforce, in particular, is highlighted as an AI-native platform designed to deliver intelligent, personalized, and e ff ective business solutions by combining predictive and generative AI. Agentforce 3.0 is built on an asynchronous, event-driven architecture with multimodal voice capabilities, which we believe has been a tough technical challenge to solve. Data 360 works as a stop gap measure to harmonize data across the clouds. While n most enterprise customers already have a sophisticated data strategy built on best in breed data warehouses like Snow fl ake and Databricks, we view Data 360 as 'the easy button' to harmonize customer data speci fi cally for Agentforce use cases. All Agentforce deployments e ff ectively must come with a base level SKU of Data 360 that includes platform enhancements such as Agentforce data libraries, session tracing data models for debug logs, structured and unstructured data retrievers.

One of the biggest di ff erentiators of Salesforce today is the platform expertise that n supports them. There is an entire ecosystem (ex. Flows and Apex) that exists that can help solve customer data estate challenges and is already entrenched in the Salesforce ecosystem. Additionally, Salesforce is the de-facto solution for sales reps and as such has become a critical tool required for organizations looking to attract

Data: The platform has evolved to incorporate Data 360 and Lakehouse o technologies alongside traditional relational data stores, simplifying the management of large data volumes and enabling real-time data processing. The traditional data store (SalesforceDB) continues to be important for managing SoR data e ff ectively, which is then ingested into Data 360. Data 360 is a hyperscale data lakehouse platform that uni fi es customer data from diverse sources, both structured and unstructured, to provide a comprehensive and real-time view. A key technical aspect is its 'zero-copy' integration, which allows it to access and use external data from various data warehouses and lakes (like Snow fl ake or Databricks) without moving or duplicating it, leveraging open formats like Apache Iceberg and Parquet.

Application Suite: Salesforce has rebuilt Marketing Cloud, Revenue Cloud, o and Commerce Cloud on the Salesforce platform, such that they bene fi t from all the foundational elements from the replatforming. Our industry conversations suggests that this is a continual e ff ort as Salesforce works to include more functionality in these rebuilt products over time. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 or retain top sales talent. This adds to the stickiness of the product, and we believe makes it more likely for organizations to incorporate agentic technology via Salesforce for these personas in order to streamline processes and reduce the number of tools that are needed (vendor consolidation has been a powerful theme over the past 3 years as enterprises look to reduce the number of vendors in their tech stacks).

- We believe AI protocols and API-based technologies will make it easier to connect n data across di ff erent architectures. This includes MCP (Model Context Protocal) which allows Generative AI models to dynamically retrieve necessary data directly from source systems on demand, eliminating the need for data copying or syncing. This also increases the importance of the MuleSoft in 2018. Mulesoft helps connect Salesforce with a wide array of disparate systems using reusable APIs, including on-premises legacy applications, other cloud platforms (like SAP or Oracle), and custom-built solutions. The question then becomes: what are the limiting factors to Agentforce deployment from a technical and go to market standpoint, and how does it contribute to the growth algorithm?

Customers now have more control over where they want outputs to be on the o spectrum of deterministic to probabilistic (ex. Agentforce studio). Voice now works as a channel (Salesforce discussed voice at Agentforce 2024 o but our industry conversations suggest it was only e ff ectively introduced in 2025) Resolution rates are on par or approaching AI native pure plays (vs. Sierra, o Decagon), currently in the 50-80% range depending on the customer but internally Salesforce is able to drive an 86% resolution rate. This is likely weighted toward text-based channels. The SI ecosystem is maturing - for example, we spoke to one large NA SI that o deployed a product wizard and customer service agent for a $20bn athletic retailer that has streamlined a 6-7 month custom deployment into a playbook that is repeatable.

Latency is still an issue. In our conversations, more than one industry o participant speci fi cally highlighted faster responsiveness from a DIY solution built on Anthropic. Some work fl ows are still not integrated well e.g. customers have to copy/paste o AI generated emails into core Salesforce work fl ows. Quality is still an issue. For example, our observations engaging with the o Williams Sonoma customer service agent suggest that multiple loops are required to get to a reasonable answer for a questions on types of pans to use for speci fi c recipes, or more speci fi c prompts for hostess gifts. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

The level of concern around privacy and security from regulated industries o ( fi nancials, healthcare) is still very high. Salesforce has introduced hashing of queried private data to help address this; i.e. sensitive customer information in the context of the query will be hashed before the query is sent out to the LLM. However, there is still an active debate over what privacy controls will ultimately be su ffi cient for adoption. A number of Salesforce customers are on older versions of the platform that o they have built signi fi cant customizations around. These customizations can make it impossible to adopt Agentforce technology. A customer interested in Salesforce Voice might be unable to adopt it before embarking on a much larger platform upgrade with Salesforce due to the customizations built on their older version of the stack. This is particularly true in Marketing and Commerce where a lot of the heavy lifting around improving these products has been done, but many customers are not on these improved versions today.

M&A: Many of these limiting factors can be addressed through a combination of n organic and inorganic development. For example, Salesforce announced 9 acquisitions in 2025, many aimed at improving Agentforce capabilities. This represents a step up from 4 deals in 2024 and 1 deals in 2023. Given the level of noise in the startup ecosystem, we expect that there will continue to be opportunities for Salesforce to acquire innovative technology from the private markets in order to keep pace with the level of innovation we are seeing in that ecosystem. Informatica: Salesforce believes that Informatica can help Agentforce o through its rich data catalog, data integration, governance, quality and privacy, metadata management, and MDM capabilities. We see this acquisition as a way for Salesforce to address many of the concerns that enterprises have today with both data hygiene and security concerns. We look to better understand the timeline in which this technology can be integrated in order to start addressing these concerns and help enterprises ramp Agentforce adoption (Data 360).

One of the more striking observations to us from Dreamforce 2025 is the degree to n which large enterprises rely on Salesforce to guide them through front o ffi ce digital transformation. We believe the strategic nature of these relationships are a function of 20+ years of driving leadership in Sales cloud, which is arguably the most mission critical business enablement tool in an organization, and ranks higher in the budget stack than many other line items (e.g. we estimate front o ffi ce software ranks in the top quartile of budget line items in a typical large enterprise and CRM is the largest area of enterprise software spend globally). At a higher level: We believe Salesforce sells sales software well because they are good at every level of selling: the executive team has deep relationships with C-level leaders at customers; and conferences like Agentforce on Tour and Dreamforce facilitate networking and best practices at a greater scale than we've observed at prior conferences.

While Agentforce is too important of an investment to bene fi t from traditional n principles of virality (eg. typically new Salesforce products are easier to sell into its install base, however we don't expect this to be true for Agentforce due to the mission critical nature of the product), we do think the reference selling model will hold over time. As Chairman and CEO Mr. Benio ff discussed in October: fl agship customers such as Disney, Williams Sonoma and Pepsi will set the bar for agentic transformation in a way that creates competitive intensify: adopt, or be left behind. The go to market evolution includes innovations such as AELAs (Agentic Enterprise n License Agreements) to help customers budget

2. What does this mean for numbers - deconstructing Salesforce's $60bn FY30 target Salesforce introduced FY30 targets at Dreamforce in October 2025: $60 bn in revenue, with a 10% CAGR 2025-2030, and a Rule of 50 pro fi le (implies low 40s margin at a high single digit growth rate in 2030). For FY26 (Jan), Salesforce is on track for 9% revenue growth and 34% margin. Our analysis aims to break down the key building blocks of the growth algorithm to determine a) how realistic the 2030 targets are and a reasonable upside case; b) the potential catalyst path (both upside and downside) that could drive outsized stock moves. Our forecast takes into account several key principles:

Agentforce adoption will be more meaningful in Service and Sales, in turn pulling n through Data 360. This comprises 50% of Salesforce's mix. This is a combination of a) Salesforce having the strongest technology o ff erings in these two segments; b) these two segments showing the most e ff ective use cases (measurable ROI, veri fi able outcomes). These use cases speci fi cally include agents for Customer Service queries, and coaching for sales people (such as prompts for best responses). Agentforce adoption will be limited in Commerce and Marketing, pending a n heightened pace of product innovation. In Commerce, we believe mid market and even large enterprises are increasingly standardizing on Shopify (we expect Shopify Plus MRR will be up close to +30% yoy in 2025, accelerating versus 2024) and it will 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

take time for Salesforce to refresh its roadmap and execute on tangible improvements to stem churn. In Marketing, we believe that Salesforce is behind on several product cycles (such as omnichannel analytics), the ecosystem is shifting away from them, and that competition has intensi fi ed. Without a clear technology leadership position, we believe it will be challenging for Salesforce to introduce and monetize compelling agentic tools. (Put simply, the base product has to be very good today for customers to commit to a longer AI journey).

Platform revenue can sustain low-to-mid teens growth, supported by Agentforce n adoption at the platform layer, Data 360's importance in realizing value from agents, and Slack becoming more di ff erentiated given its importance in work fl ows that will be augmented by AI. AI will expand the software TAM by over 20% in 2030 in Service and Sales. This is n based on our bottom up analysis of ROI in the call center using both value-based and cost-based pricing models, with key variables being de fl ection rates and cost per conversation. Our value-based analysis assumes that software provides capture 10-20% of the productivity improvements they deliver to customers (see our TAM & Framework section for more detail).

Based on our customer conversations, we estimate there is a similar 20% uplift on n deal sizes when customers adopt Agentforce. While early customers may have gotten preferential pricing, we also see the potential for upside to initial agreements (as customers are only likely to commit to deal sizes that re fl ect their current AI adoption expectations, which could ultimately surprise to the upside as new features are launched). As such, we can model cohorts over time to cross-test our 2030 forecast. We expect Agentforce revenue to have healthy expansion given the consumption based revenue model & natural roll out of AI solutions across an organization. Integration and Analytics revenue will bene fi t from the value of MuleSoft's data n connection capabilities, partially o ff set by Tableau where we see more likelihood of disintermediation. Exhibit 76: We believe Agentforce adoption can result in 3% upside to Street estimates as a base case, with further upside scenarios coming into focus as adoption ramps

Competition: Changes in the competitive environment could hurt Salesforce. The n competitive environment has been particularly dynamic given the explosion of AI driven startups and concerns that players at the infrastructure or platform level could become competitive in the application layer. Agentforce Adoption: Lower or slower adoption of Agentforce vs. expectations. n The rollout of AI across enterprises has been slow and behind investor expectations due to the complexity of deployments, internal change management, and noise in the ecosystem distracting customers. If less customers vs. our expectations decide to adopt Agentforce or if it takes longer for Salesforce to acquire and monetize customers, there could be downside to our forecasts. M&A: Salesforce is highly acquisitive and as such we see the potential for M&A to act n as a negative risk. For example, deals that bring higher integration costs, cause near term business disruption, negatively impact the fi nancial pro fi le of the company, or don't result in a positive return on investment could all be drivers of downside.

Margins : Salesforce has recently expanded margins meaningfully. If the company n decided to invest more vs. our expectations in a way that resulted in pro fi tability pressure, the stock could see downside. Additionally, if the company looks to drive too much margin expansion such that they do not invest enough for growth, there

We assume coverage of ServiceNow (NOW) with a Buy rating and 40% upside to our 12-month price target of $205. We see a high liklihood of ServiceNow sustaining a ~20% organic CAGR through 2029 as it leans into still-robust expansion opportunities in new domains such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Human Capital Management (HCM). We believe share gain momentum is a function of ServiceNow's unique positioning as a work fl ow engine (rather than a system of record), including via its uni fi ed multi-instance architecture and its deep connectivity that enables actions in adjacent systems. On AI, we see two ways NOW is uniquely positioned: fi rst, as an orchestration engine that manages AI deployments broadly through tools like AI control tower; and second, as delivering direct productivity improvements and taking share from the labor budgets that sit next to functions such as the IT help desk.

Lastly, ServiceNow's expanding real estate in the tech stack coupled with its willingness to engage in M&A position the company well for adjacencies in Security.

- 1. Bridging to 20% organic growth in each of the next 3 years ServiceNow's transition from IT-centric work fl ows to an orchestration engine that spans multiple applications (ERP, CRM, HCM, etc.) is well underway. ServiceNow's origins are as an IT service management (ITSM) platform, digitizing IT help desk and operation work fl ows alongside the last 20 years of enterprise modernization. The company has increasingly applied its core work fl ow engine as a horizontal plaform (the Now Platform) to drive productivity growth across existing ERP, CRM, and HCM systems. Rather than a system of record, ServiceNow is a system of action that connects siloed applications, and its success today is a function of its core competencies with integrations and a single code base. As a result, while enterprise SaaS peers' have decelerated by ~25 pts post COVID (1Q22 to 4Q25E), ServiceNow's growth has slowed by 7 points. ServiceNow's ability

to maintain a steady level of growth at its scale of $13bn ARR is best in class among software companies, and a key debate for the stock is its ability to maintain ~20% growth rates over the near to medium term.

- Customer and Industry Work fl ows: ServiceNow launched its Customer Service n Management (CSM) solution in 2016, designed to unify front/middle/back-o ffi ce operations so that customer issues could be solved across department domains and across service agents, fi eld teams, and IT systems. Building on this, ServiceNow launched industry speci fi c verticals (i.e. fi nancial services, healthcare, manufacturing, telecom, etc.), and platform solutions such as sales and order management (launched in 2024) to manage the sales lifecycle. The acquisition of Logik.ai in April 2025 further bolstered its AI-powered CRM and Sales Order Management capabilities, particularly for complex Con fi gure, Price, Quote (CPQ) solutions (a particular industry pain point per our industry conversations). Across these developments, ServiceNow has shifted its positioning in the CRM market from being complementary to being directly competitive. Our industry conversations 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

suggest ServiceNow remains behind leaders on traditional CRM functions in core front-o ffi ce functions tied to sales, marketing, and customer acquisitions, such as lead generation and campaign management, sales pipeline management, and account management. Instead, its strength is in post-sale customer operations. However, ServiceNow is actively expanding its capabilities, such as via the acquisition of Logik.ai for CPQ. We expect ServiceNow to continue its push into core sales work fl ows: while our industry checks have brought up examples of Salesforce rip and replace, we believe the most likely scenario is that ServiceNow consistently abstracts value from these platforms by sitting alongside them.

Employee Work fl ows: ServiceNow has also moved into employee-facing n applications and HCM. Its HCM solutions typically function as a 'system of experience' that sit on top of existing HCM software vendors rather than replacing them as a system of record. ServiceNow leverages its work fl ow automation to automate HR processes, such as employee onboarding, by treating them similarly to IT service tickets. It integrates with existing HCM systems to expand HR and IT capabilities, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure smoother data fl ows.

Creator & Other Work fl ows: This is a comprehensive suite of tools and capabilities n that enables users of all technical skill levels to build, deploy, and manage custom applications and automate work fl ows on the Now Platform. It is largely synonymous with ServiceNow's App Engine, which serves as the underlying platform for these development activities. These work fl ows are low-code/no-code development, enabling users from professional developers to business users to automate and digitize manual processes, optimize service delivery, drive digital transformation, and create custom solutions tailored to unique business needs across various departments. Risk & Security Work fl ows: See more details below n Exhibit 82: New ACV mix by work fl ow shows ServiceNow continues to expand out of core IT work fl ows Source: Company data We introduce a market share analysis of ServiceNow's current breakdown by work fl ow, using disclosure of ACV as a proxy for subscription revenue, to inform our view of sustained 20% growth.

- ServiceNow discloses yearly ACV across customer and industry, employee, and n 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 creator work fl ows. We estimate historical security work fl ow ACV based on Gartner revenue estimates and company disclosure. We back into implied tech work fl ows assuming it is the remainder of subscription revenue. We then estimate market share by work fl ow. As ServiceNow typically operates as the n system of action rather than the system of record (which the market data skews toward), we apply a % multiplier to the Gartner estimate based on ServiceNow's product o ff erings and maturity in an attempt to more accurately capture ServiceNow's serviceable addressable market. This analysis is illustrative, but we believe it is a good starting point to determine ServiceNow's current penetration and reasonable medium-term growth algorithm across these work fl ows.

From this market share analysis, we arrive at estimated market share gains by n considering the trend and competitive dynamics through 2028 in each of the work fl ows, arriving at ~15% market share in FY28 (vs. ~12% in FY24). Based on this base case, we see ServiceNow poised to grow 21%/20%/18% over FY26/27/28 these estimates are 1%/2%/2% above the Street and imply a 20% CAGR from FY24 to FY28. Importantly, these estimates are based on the current trendlines and do not assume any upside potential from increased enterprise AI adoption.

Potential upside tied to ServiceNow's AI strategy We believe there may be upside to our base case model driven by increased adoption of ServiceNow's AI solutions. In our view, ServiceNow is one of the best positioned incumbent SaaS provider to establish itself as an orchestration layer across di ff erent knowledge work fl ows because it is already embedded across multiple enterprise work fl ows (ITSM broadly, HR, Finance, and increasingly CRM).

ServiceNow's Work fl ow Data Fabric and RaptorDB technology are foundational building blocks designed to support agentic deployment: Work fl ow Data Fabric (WDF) is the integration and semantic layer - it connects n business and technology data, processes it in context via a uni fi ed model, and takes action by triggering work fl ows without moving the data (with Zero Copy connectors across databases like Snow fl ake, Databricks, BigQuery, etc.). WDF was part of ServiceNow's broader shift towards being an enterprise orchestration layer, making work fl ows data-aware to enable Now Platform automations to act across HR, IT, fi nance, customer service, etc. use cases. Work fl ow Data Fabric enables continuous operational improvement, faster enterprise-wide integration (up to 6x faster), and a reduction in TCO by up to 70% (vs. third-party iPaaS solutions).

RaptorDB is ServiceNow's Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing n (HTAP) database speci fi cally engineered for ServiceNow workloads. Based on PostgreSQL open-source standards and enhanced through ServiceNow's acquisition of Swarm64 in 2021 (a database software accelerator), RaptorDB serves as the foundational data layer to deliver faster work fl ow performance - one customer saw >4x improvement in SQL response time, 73% faster report loading, and an 80% reduction in UI response time. RaptorDB Standard improves scale and performance for workloads and queries; RaptorDB Pro is the premium version with advanced features such as: 1) HTAP architecture; 2) integrated column-store index, accelerating reporting and query time; 3) built-in parallel processing allowing the system to handle heavy tra ffi c and large datasets; and 4) performance improvements in transaction times.

Together, WDF and RaptorDB are enablers for agentic deployment within the ServiceNow ecosystem . Work fl ow Data Fabric ensures that AI agents have real-time, secure, and contextual access to data from any source. This data context allows agents to act intelligently and autonomously, making informed decisions and executing complex tasks. RaptorDB Pro's speed and scalability reduce performance bottlenecks because agentic work fl ows often involve both real time transactional actions and analytical queries, RaptorDB supports both with its HTAP system. This results in quicker insights and the ability to take immediate action, even with massive datasets and high transactional volumes.

With WDF and RaptorDB as the core building blocks, ServiceNow's agentic portfolio is built on four product pillars that transform intent into outcomes: prebuilt and domain-speci fi c agents (Now Assist), low/no -code builder tools (AI Agent Studio and Build Agent), multi -agent coordination layers (AI Agent Orchestrator and AI Agent Fabric), and a uni fi ed entry point (AI Experience): - NowAssist: ServiceNow o ff ers thousands of prebuilt AI agents embedded into n 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

ServiceNow work fl ows, including summarization of cases, virtual agent responses, and code/ fl ow generation. In CRM, CRM AI agents autonomously orchestrate and complete tasks across the customer lifecycle of selling, ful fi lling, and servicing. Where traditional automation requires pre-de fi ned rules, these agents dynamically determine the best course of action by resolving inquiries, routing complex cases with full context, and managing work fl ows across departments. Internally at ServiceNow, these agents are automating 37% of internal customer support case work fl ows. Momentum is picking up with NowAssist: in May 2025, management discussed 50% growth in usage month over month; by November 2025, consumption had increased 55x+ since the end of May.

AI Agent Studio & Build Agent: AI Agent Studio streamlines building and composing n agents with guided, natural-language setup and adds dashboards tying usage, quality, and value to business KPIs for lifecycle management. Build Agent brings 'vibe coding' to the enterprise - it enables creators to describe an app in natural language and receive a production-ready application equipped with audit trails, security, and compliance. AI Agent Orchestrator/AI Agent Fabric: AI Agent Orchestrator enables inter-agent n communication and centralized coordination so agents can share context and hand o ff across systems - for example, a customer onboarding process that spans multiple tools and teams. AI Agent Fabric is the communication backbone for heterogeneous ecosystems, supporting protocols such as MCP and A2A to connect ServiceNow and third-party agents and tools.

AI Experience: AI Experience is a conversational interface to Enterprise AI. It n provides a context -aware front door with instant access to text, voice, image, web, and build agents across any work fl ow, including the autonomous CRM o ff ering. All of these agentic portfolios are uni fi ed under AI Control Tower, which is the centralized command center to govern, manage, secure, and realize value from any ServiceNow or third-party AI agent, model, and work fl ow. The Control Tower provides a single view of every AI asset with consistent policies applied across the estate - it helps align AI programs to enterprise strategy by tracking adoption, value creation, and governance postures across the portfolio.

Monetization Considerations: ServiceNow's core is a seat-based subscription model where customers pay for user licenses, with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. There is a tiered product structure with three pricing levels: 1) Standard edition, the entry-level o ff ering with core functionality (~45% of customer accounts for ITSM/CSM); 2) Pro edition, with enhanced capabilities (~49%). The Pro SKUs have ~25% price uplift over standard; and 3) the Pro Plus edition, with AI capabilities and advanced features (~6%). The Pro Plus SKUs have ~30% price uplift over pro.

ServiceNow has also introduced a hybrid pricing model for AI Capabilities (Now Assist), combining the traditional subscription model with a consumption element. Customers purchase a base subscription for Now Assist Usage, which includes a fi nite amount of tokens or capacity for AI usage burned down based on actual usage. Once the initial capacity is exhausted, customers can purchase additional 'assist packs' without a full subscription renewal, with consumption tracked through 'assists.' Each interaction with AI agents counts towards this consumption. Management expects the consumption of 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

assists with AI will be a multiple factor higher than a standard Now Assist query as customers adopt more complex AI work fl ows. Material monetization on the consumption side isn't expected to impact the model until 2027 as customers consume their tokens and purchase additional capacity. In the near-term, AI is increasingly pulling customers up the pricing stack - Pro penetration was up 10% (from 45% to 55%) as of the May 2025 investor day, and 15% of the customers on Standard that upgraded in 2024 went straight to Pro Plus to leverage agentic capabilities (with ~60% average realized price uplift for these double upgrades).

ServiceNow's AI platform is the fastest growing product family in its history, with 1,000 customers using the platform and $250mn+ in ACV as of May 2025 - management expects NowAssist ACV contribution to reach $1bn by 2026. As of 3Q, ServiceNow was on track to exceed $500mn in ACV. We believe that ServiceNow's AI strategy positions it well to capture an increasing share of AI budgets, with medium-term opportunity as revenue contributions scale more meaningfully in 2027 as usage ramps and Assist packs gain traction.

Incremental to the internal agentic development is the Moveworks acquisition (closed 12/16), which combines ServiceNow's work fl ow automation and existing AI solutions with Moveworks' front-end conversational AI and enterprise search capabilities. Moveworks brings a natural language interface that enables employees to resolve IT, HR, and business issues through chat-based interactions while ServiceNow's platform executes and orchestrates the requests. Their platform is built on top of a blend of foundation models, SLM task-speci fi c models, and their custom MoveLM model (providing industry, domain and company-speci fi c vocabulary and work fl ows) to improve the accuracy of responses. With $100mn in ARR in 2024 and 5mn users, we view this acquisition as ServiceNow seeing a gap in its functionality and accelerating its time to market by moving to acquire (vs. build in house).

meaningful new product cycle for ServiceNow over the next 5 years . Based on ServiceNow's public commentary and our discussions in industry, we think select Security functionality a) sits adjacent to ServiceNow's existing positioning in the technology stack; b) leverages its core strengths; c) is a large enough TAMs to move the needle at ServiceNow's current scale. ServiceNow disclosed over $1bn in ACV tied to Risk and Security work fl ows (which is included within tech work fl ows). We see a scenario where ServiceNow's AI functionality could increasingly complement or abstract governance functionality from IGA tools, particularly given the white space associated with agentic (i.e. there is no standardized playbook on how to secure agents). As a case study, consider the move to cloud, where a portion of the cloud security opportunity was captured by IaaS vendors. Similarly, we believe a portion of the identity governance opportunity may be captured by AI platform vendors like ServiceNow in

tools such as the AI control tower. We spoke to one ServiceNow customer who tried to use AI builder to augment its SailPoint budget: while this project worked as a prototype but ultimately did not make it into production, it is illustrative of the potential for ServiceNow to expand into more explicit governance use cases. Lastly, we believe ServiceNow does not have strong technology today that runs at the kernel level (our understanding is its tools primarily run in the user space). Kernel level access could improve the depth of data and control that ServiceNow has in its environments, and could be acquired via select endpoint or cloud workload protection (CWP) assets. ServiceNow recently announced its planned acquisition of Veza , which supports broad IGA capabilities including access reviews, access requests, and an access hub, AI A ge n t O r c h est r ato r: Enables inter-agent communication and centralized coordination so agents can share context and hand off across systems

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 along with permission updates and end-to-end visibility. Veza's Access Graph gives organizations a single dashboard to quickly spot and remedy overly broad permissions across both human and machine identities, including AI agents. Founded in 2020, Veza serves nearly 150 global enterprise customers in banking, hospitality, and fast-moving consumer goods, with 230 employees globally. Terms of the transaction were undisclosed, though reports indicated a transaction value of $1bn+.

ServiceNow plans to integrate Veza's Access Graph with ServiceNow's AI Control Tower and agentic work fl ows to provide a single pane of glass and control of every identity in an organization. Veza would also add identity context to existing ServiceNow Security and Risk products, including Vulnerability Response, Incident Response, and Integrated Risk Management, giving customers a clearer view of who and what is associated with an exposure, incident, or risk event. Identity security is increasingly becoming a core pillar of Security Operations, and we believe Veza would strengthen exposure management, incident response, and integrated risk management capabilities.

ServiceNow also announced its planned acquisition of Armis for $7.75bn, its largest acquisition to date by deal value. Armis is a security platform that discovers, monitors, and protects connected devices (IT, OT, IoT, IoMT, etc.) across an organization's network, o ff ering asset visibility and cyber risk management to secure the entire attack surface. Founded in 2015, Armis serves 35%+ of the Fortune 100 and 7 of the Fortune 10, with 950 employees globally - it generates $340mn ARR with 50%+ yoy growth.

With the acquisition, ServiceNow plans to expand its security work fl ow o ff erings in cyber-physical security for critical infrastructure and advance security and vulnerability response across connected devices. Armis delivers a view of an organization's assets as a network of connected entities (devices, services, applications, identities, and data fl ows) and the paths between them, driven by graph-based technology. ServiceNow believes that the intended acquisition would expand its security o ff erings, particularly in cyber exposure management and cyber-physical security, by integrating Armis's real-time asset discovery and threat intelligence with ServiceNow's automated work fl ows for proactive security and risk reduction. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

valuation methodology is based on non-GAAP P/E. We apply a 40x P/E multiple to ServiceNow's SNTM (Q5-Q8) earnings. We consider the broader group of software peers that compete in the application and platform layers, with Rule of 40 pro fi les, which trade 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 at a median 34x P/E (excluding comps trading at >100x). ServiceNow's EPS growth is ~30% above the cohort - as such, we apply a 20% premium to ServiceNow to account for EPS growth, partly o ff set by limited visibility into the evolving pricing model.

Slowing momentum in new market expansion reducing growth trajectory: n ServiceNow's growth trajectory is signi fi cantly in fl uenced by its ability to expand into new markets through new product o ff erings and industry verticals - these new markets are often highly competitive, with established players specializing in HR, CRM, or industry-speci fi c solutions. Slowing momentum would likely make it di ffi cult for ServiceNow to sustain its 20%+ growth watermark. Lack of adoption of AI solutions: ServiceNow's strategic direction and future n growth are increasingly tied to its ability to integrate and drive the adoption of AI solutions across its platform. Moreover, ServiceNow's traditional o ff erings are seat-based solutions, which may come under pressure if its not o ff set by adoption of ServiceNow's agentic o ff erings. Limited margin expansion: Higher expense growth from S&M e ff orts or agentic n investments limiting margin expansion. Also, large scale M&A transactions may be viewed as a medium-term risk to margin expansion.

We assume coverage of Snow fl ake (SNOW) with a Buy rating and 28% upside to our 12-month price target of $286. We see three primary drivers of upside in 2026: 1) We believe cloud RDBMS migrations are picking up due to AI, and that Snow fl ake will continue to capture outsized share of the cloud data platform market and associated data analytics projects. 2) Our analysis of customer cohorts suggest that existing customers are poised to contribute greater dollars in FY27, as net customer adds over the past two years scale more materially and Snow fl ake continues to drive expansion within its higher spend customers. 3) We believe Snow fl ake has made meaningful progress on closing the functionality gap with Databricks for ML/AI workloads; and that Snow fl ake-heavy customers are more likely to consider using Snow fl ake for new ML/AI workloads.

Over the long term, we monitor two key risks: i) whether Snow fl ake's pace of new customer acquisition could slow as Databricks continues to build out its roadmap for a set of workloads that historically accrued to Snow fl ake, from its relatively stronger beachhead in ML/AI (which has increased in strategic importance for customers); ii) whether Iceberg reduces switching cost for Snow fl ake and other data platform vendors, such that the industry becomes more competitive over time, driving higher R&D intensity or M&A intensity relative to the last 10 years.

- 1. Continued market share gains as AI catalyzes next phase of cloud migrations We believe cloud RDBMS migrations are picking up due to AI, and that Snow fl ake will continue to capture outsized share of the cloud data platform market and associated data analytics projects. As enterprises continue to migrate workloads from on-premise to cloud environments, Snow fl ake's SAM within the broader TAM goes up. During the early stages of migrations, companies typically shift existing databases to the cloud in phases, leading to steadily rising consumption after initial deployment. Thus, the key opportunity for Snow fl ake is when these companies modernize their data architecture by consolidating silos, rebuilding pipelines, and enabling new analytics and AI use cases. As more enterprises progress through digital transformation programs, Snow fl ake bene fi ts not just from new customer acquisitions but also expanding consumption as data volumes, concurrency, and workloads grow in the cloud.

We estimate that the RDBMS TAM is 55% cloud today (vs. 45% on-prem); up from <30% cloud in 2019.

We believe AI is accelerating a new wave of cloud migrations in both scope and urgency. The fi rst generation of cloud migrations (2010-2021) centered on infrastructure o ffl oad. In legacy databases, compute and storage were coupled, meaning capacity had to be provisioned for peak demand and workloads compete for resources. Snow fl ake's multi-cluster, shared data architecture eliminated these constraints by letting multiple virtual warehouses query the same data simultaneously to run workloads in parallel without performance degradation. This next phase of cloud migrations catalyzed by AI is data-centric. AI workloads depend on massive, uni fi ed data lakes for model training, fi ne-tuning, and retrieval-augmented inference. Enterprises that previously had fragmented or on-prem data architectures are increasingly focused on centralizing on the cloud to enable data readiness. Snow fl ake sits at the intersection

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 of AI-driven data movement and enterprise cloud modernization - its cloud-native data platform for uni fi ed, queryable data across clouds allows enterprises to centralize access without centralizing infrastructure, making it the 'data plane' for AI workloads. We believe Snow fl ake will continue to capture share of customer migrations from legacy databases driven by the AI-centric migration push, independent of Snow fl ake's AI innovation (discussed in more detail below).

Postgres/Crunchy Data expands its TAM by ~2x - while Snow fl ake has historically operated solely in the OLAP market, its acquisition of Crunchy Data enhances its PostgreSQL capabilities (the standard for OLTP databases) and accelerates its entry into transactional data markets. The solution extends native support for transactional, hybrid, and analytical workloads on a single platform, enabling organizations to build AI agents and intelligent apps directly on operational data. The acquisition complements Snow fl ake's Unistore (which uni fi es transactional and analytical data) by providing an enterprise-ready solution speci fi cally for transactional applications requiring PostgreSQL compatibility. While we believe it is unlikely that Snow fl ake captures mission-critical OLTP workloads near term, as companies standardize around platforms we believe Snow fl ake could be a bene fi ciary.

We note that this correlation likely diminishes going forward given hyperscaler exposure to AI training revenue Source: Company data, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research

- 2. Recent new customer momentum should drive a particularly strong expansion cohort in 2026

New customer acquisition lags ramped revenue contribution due the natural progression of customer adoption; net customer adds over the past two years give us con fi dence in Snow fl ake's medium-term growth outlook as these customers scale more materially. When new customers join Snow fl ake, they typically do not rip and replace the entire on-premise data warehouse immediately. This is especially true for enterprises with signi fi cant data volumes and intricate infrastructures. Rather, they start by migrating certain workloads and running them in Snow fl ake, over time increasing their usage. Snow fl ake's consumption-based pricing model supports this dynamic, recognizing revenue as and when customers migrate more workloads. Snow fl ake is focused on accelerating migration timelines, evidenced in its acquisition of the technology behind the Datometry software migration solution, which reduces time to move from legacy data warehouses to Snow fl ake up to 4x while reducing costs by up

2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 to 90% - nonetheless, over the medium term we continue to expect more staggered migration timelines. We highlight select customer examples below: Financial Services: This customer previously leveraged a two-tier architecture using n Hortonworks and Cloudera, and completed historical forensic analysis on Hadoop. Given an enterprise-wide push to cloud, this customer chose Snow fl ake as its preferred data warehouse. Initially, they utilized both storage and compute with Snow fl ake, though is now shifting to Iceberg tables. Nonetheless, Snow fl ake remains the preferred ingest and query engine - in fact, this customer expects to more than double its contract with Snow fl ake.

IT Consulting: This customer has been with Snow fl ake since 2021, prior to which the n company had traditional enterprise data warehouses across each of its business units (i.e. Teradata for the retail business and SAP Business Warehouse for utilities), with 1.5 PB of data across the organization. In order to communicate between the on-prem database, the customer had to create another layer on top necessitating a vast amount of data engineering, as well as another layer to connect this data to CRM software (i.e. Salesforce). Snow fl ake enabled the customer to migrate its workloads from on-prem to the cloud, but the customer noted that this was not a simple 'lift and shift.' Migrating these workloads took time - whereas some data from established software providers (i.e. Salesforce, SAP) was relatively straightforward, other custom systems (i.e. PLM and manufacturing execution systems) took time to build the data engineering connectors. Moreover, the customer noted that the cost was prohibitive to simply

lifting and shifting all of its data. In the past, Snow fl ake has noted that the dollar-weighted average time from start date to contract consumption run rate can be up to ~270 days, with a pickup in contribution ramping 1-2 years post customer acquisition. We see an ~80% correlation between net customer adds (on a quarter over quarter basis) and product revenue growth yoy on a two year lagged basis (to account for the lagged nature of new customers to revenue.) Net customers adds over the past two years suggest upside to Street estimates over the next 2 years.

In addition to migrations, we also expect continued expansion from broadening use cases among Snow fl ake's entrenched customer base. That is, even once migrations take place, Snow fl ake continues to grow with its customers by adding more data to the platform and driving new use cases. In fact, Snow fl ake has made several changes to its sales motion to incentivize additional consumption on the platform, establishing targeted specialist sales teams focused on particular applications (rather than general sales mastering all product capabilities). We expect these changes to the sales motion to continue to drive higher consumption on the platform.

Snow fl ake's top 25 customers are spending $20mn+ on average; the average Forbes Global 2000 customer (of which Snow fl ake has ~760, contributing ~40% of total revenue) is spending ~$2mn; and average revenue per customer across all customer sizes is ~$340k. We believe there is signi fi cant room to expand customer spend, and look to Oracle database as a case study of where product revenue can go - we think this is a 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

good proxy given Oracle's historical entrenchment with database customers is indicative of Snow fl ake's upper bound should there be consolidation in the data platform space around Snow fl ake. Oracle Database has ~$13bn of revenue and tens of thousands of customers - given the exact disclosure is limited, we estimate total customers between 20-40k. This implies average database revenue per customer somewhere between $500-900k (vs. Snow fl ake ARPC ~$340k). Even assuming customers remain stable at ~12k (to be clear, we expect continued customer growth of 10%+ in the medium term), the high end of our Oracle ARPC estimates imply that product revenue can get to $10bn+ (Snow fl ake's target set during the 2021 Investor Day to achieve by CY28/FY29), and this milestone is easier to achieve when accounting for continued customer acquisition. We note this analysis does not account for gains related to AI services, which we believe drives upside to ARPC.

At Snow fl ake's 2022 Investor day, management provided customer examples of consumption uplift post migration: Telecom: This customer fi rst migrated its legacy data warehouse to Snow fl ake, then n expanded its quarterly compute credit consumption by 6x (over 9 quarters) as it moved additional legacy solutions to the platform Healthcare: This customer expanded consumption 5x (over 6 quarters) by n expanding use cases (adding data engineering workloads) Exhibit 96: Net customer adds are ~80% correlated with product revenue lagged by 2 yrs; an in fl ection in customer adds over the last 2 years may drive upside to Street estimates over the next 2 Source: Company data, FactSet, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Exhibit 98: Illustrative product revenue trajectory informed by Oracle database revenue per customer implies signi fi cant runway to expand

3. Technology innovation brings AI/ML into the SAM for the fi rst time in 2026 Snow fl ake has signi fi cantly evolved its platform to manage diverse workloads and address the increasing demands of AI workloads by focusing on a uni fi ed, scalable, and cost-e ffi cient architecture, alongside the introduction of specialized AI/ML features and services. Given the importance of data architecture in an AIfi rst world, and the pace of change in the ecosystem, Snow fl ake has been focused on increased product innovation: Snow fl ake historically positioned itself as a cloud data warehouse; the platform was n optimized primarily for analytical, batch-oriented workloads on structured data. Over the last two years, Snow fl ake has rearchitected key layers of its platform to evolve from 'warehouse' to an AI Data Cloud powering agentic applications, real-time systems, and ML workloads.

Snow fl ake introduced lakehouse capabilities, supporting open table formats like n Iceberg and Delta, external data sources, and unstructured data handling. It also introduced hybrid transactional features (Unistore, Hybrid Tables, and now Snow fl ake Postgres via the acquisition of Crunchy Data) enabling operational and low-latency workloads to run next to analytical data.

Snow fl ake expanded its capabilities in the data engineering and integration market n it acquired Datavolo in November 2024, which built data fl ow infrastructure to support the creation, management, and observability of multimodal data pipelines for enterprise AI. Snow fl ake has productized Datavolo's technology as Snow fl ake OpenFlow, which serves as their strategic entry point into the data integration market (~$15bn TAM). OpenFlow provides hundreds of ready-to-use connectors for data sources (i.e. Box, Google Ads, Microsoft Dataverse, Microsoft SharePoint, Oracle, Salesforce Data Cloud, ServiceNow, Workday, and Zendesk, etc.) to accelerate data integration. It enables secure automation of data integration from virtually any source while keeping data centralized across the enterprise lakehouse. This technology gives Snow fl ake more access into the entire data lifecycle, rather than engaging with the data only when it reaches the analytics phase. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Snowpark is the developer framework that allows data engineers and developers to write data pipelines and ML work fl ows using familiar languages like Python, Java, and Scala, directly within Snow fl ake platform to process data and build applications directly within Snow fl ake. Its technical capabilities for AI/ML include in-platform processing for complex data transformations, feature engineering, and model inference, which reduces latency and streamlines the ML lifecycle. Snowpark ML, a Python library, speci fi cally supports end-to-end ML work fl ows, allowing users to leverage popular Python frameworks for preprocessing, feature engineering, and training. For advanced AI workloads, Snowpark Container Services (SPCS) facilitates the deployment and management of containerized applications, including custom LLMs and open-source models, securely within Snow fl ake, with support for GPU instances. Snowpark also supports model deployment as User-De fi ned Functions (UDFs) for real-time inference and integrates with tools like MLFlow for model

lifecycle management, including versioning and experimentation. Snowpark is currently ~3% of Snow fl ake's product revenue (or ~$130mn for FY26).

- Sano fi : This customer replaced its managed Spark solution with Snow fl ake, resulting n in a 50% in improvement in performance. Sano fi is developing an enteprise-wide data processing platform, creating a web application for medical professions to input query fi lters related to diseases, drugs, or procedures and identify patient cohorts meeting speci fi c criteria to analyze real-world clinical data. The web application processes billions of records to generate these insights. Previously, Sano fi 's data architecture relied on a managed Spark engine as its computational layer. This strategy led to issues with manual deployment and maintenance, resource 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

scalability, pipeline failures, concurrency issues during peak usage, and data movement complexities between platforms. It chose Snow fl ake for one of its redesigns, leveraging Snowpark as the computational layer for Python code within the Snow fl ake data platform, eliminating the need for data transfer and ensuring governance over data and libraries. This migration from managed Spark to Snowpark resulted in 50% performance improvement.

Snow fl ake Cortex is a fully managed AI service that integrates ready-to-use AI and ML capabilities directly into Snow fl ake Data Cloud. It o ff ers a suite of pre-built functions that leverage leading LLMs from various providers, enabling natural language processing (NLP) tasks directly via SQL or Python (Cortex AISQL). Capabilities include text analysis such as summarization, sentiment analysis, entity extraction, and classi fi cation, as well as translation and natural language querying. Notable features include: 1) ML functions for traditional tasks like forecasting, anomaly detection, and classi fi cation, o ff ering pre-built models for common business needs; 2) Cortex Search, which provides AI-driven 'fuzzy' search across text data using hybrid search technology (vector and keyword search) and semantic re-ranking; 3) Cortex Analyst for natural language querying of structured data by translating questions into SQL; and 4) Cortex Agents for building production-ready AI applications that can reason across data and utilize tools like Cortex

Analyst and Cortex Search. Cortex combines structured data (via Cortex Analyst) and unstructured data (via Cortex Search) to enable natural language queries, a key evolution to Snow fl ake's platform which has historically been more focused on structured data. Cortex has a usage-based pricing model, charging in credits per million tokens (for LLM functions) and per GB per month (for Cortex search). Other AI o ff erings include Snow fl ake Intelligence, which enables business users to use AI-driven natural language to interact with data and Document AI, which extracts structured and unstructured data from various document formats. On adoption, 7,300+ accounts are using Snow fl ake's AI every week and 28% of all deployed use cases are now leveraging AI.

Our industry conversations suggest that Databricks is still the superior tool for ML/AI workloads, and we expect Databricks to continue to innovate to maintain a technical lead that is meaningful enough to drive competitive di ff erentiation. In this context, we believe Snow fl ake will still be able to capture some lower-hanging ML/AI workloads; for example, those within customers that have already chosen to standardize on Snow fl ake and that do not want to make their environment more complex for what they view as only a marginal performance bene fi t from Databricks. We view 2026 as the fi rst year where Snow fl ake will have access to a portion of these workloads for the fi rst time. The key longer term will be whether Snow fl ake will be able to further close the gap with Databricks such that it can capture higher performance ML/AI use cases, and win new customer opportunities for customers that consider ML/AI to be key criteria for their data warehouse provider.

A note on Iceberg and risks to the model: As discussed above, Snow fl ake introduced support for Apache Iceberg in 2025, an open-source table format for data lakes that allows di ff erent query engines (including Snow fl ake) to directly read and write to the same data fi les in cloud object storage. Snow fl ake's support for Apache Iceberg tables (with 1,200+ accounts using it) allows customers to work with open data as they would with data stored in Snow fl ake, preserving enterprise-grade performance and security 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

while avoiding vendor lock-in. Prior to its support for Iceberg, customers had to ingest data into Snow fl ake's platform and pay for storage, which historically has been ~11% of Snow fl ake's product revenue (at much lower margins than core compute revenue). To date, we believe Iceberg adoption is still very early; Snow fl ake has not seen a headwind to storage revenue from Iceberg support, with storage revenue growing in line with the rest of the business. Over time, we expect storage revenue to decline as more customers leverage Iceberg, though note that it will not necessarily go to zero given the technical involvement of managing the data in Iceberg. More broadly, we think the open data format expands Snow fl ake's addressable workload opportunity, potentially yielding additional consumption upside.

The push towards Iceberg lowers the switching cost between data platforms, as data gravity/storage stickiness is no longer a reason to standardize on a speci fi c vendor. While this increases the pressure to stay ahead of competition, we believe that performance and versatility of the platform become the factors that drive stickiness. Snow fl ake continuously enhances its platform through annual hardware and software improvements. Its latest Gen2 Warehouses signi fi cantly enhance performance for analytics and data engineering workloads - generally available since May 2025, Gen2 Warehouses consistently demonstrate performance improvements, with an average gain of approximately 30% across various query patterns and up to 2.1 times faster execution for core analytics scenarios. We believe that these performance improvements incentivize customers to add more workloads to the platform, even if customers are not storing data on Snow fl ake.

Moreover, data sharing is supportive of stickiness on Snow fl ake's platform, with 3.5k marketplace listings and ~40% of customers with at least 1 stable edge (a data/native app share between provider and consumer customers that generates at least 20 compute jobs consuming resources/generating revenue over two consecutive three-week periods). This design enables cross-ecosystem value creation, where data sharing between enterprises creates a web of interconnected relationships, positioning Snow fl ake as the central data exchange layer for industries and increasing stickiness.

We assume coverage with a Buy rating and a 12-month price target of $286. Our valuation methodology is based on EV/FCF. We apply a 65x FCF multiple to Snow fl ake's SNTM (Q5-Q8) uFCF, consistent with our broader coverage framework. This is a slight discount to peers at 70x to account for more volatility qoq given consumption model.

Competition from cloud service providers (CSPs) and Databricks: Snow fl ake n faces signi fi cant competitive risks from both established cloud service providers (CSPs) and Databricks, as these entities o ff er alternative or overlapping data management and analytics solutions that can attract or retain customers. CSPs provide native data warehousing, analytics, and data lake services, and can leverage their infrastructure to o ff er competitive pricing and bundling options. Databricks is a risk to Snow fl ake particularly in the realm of uni fi ed data platforms and AI/ML workloads. While Snow fl ake has been expanding its AI/ML capabilities, Databricks has a perceived lead and a more mature integrated o ff ering for these advanced analytics use cases.

Adverse changes in the IT spending environment or further optimization cycles n in cloud spending: Given Snow fl ake's business model is reliant on customer consumption of its platform, adverse changes in the broader IT spending environment or intensi fi ed cloud spending optimization cycles pose risks, either through reduced new customer acquisition, decreased expansion from existing customers, budget cuts/project delays, or increased scrutiny on spend. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

We assume coverage of Workday with a Neutral rating (from Buy) and 15% upside to our 12-month price target of $238. Relative to scaled SaaS peers, we believe Workday faces two challenges: 1) its core TAM of HCM is smaller and more penetrated than CRM and ERP, which may make it more challenging to realize growth from share gains tied to the SaaS transition; 2) its AI strategy has taken longer to crystallize, and we expect 2026 will be key to integrate recent acquisitions such as Sana while also replatforming the underlying tech stack. With that said, we see the opportunity to become more positive on the stock through 2026, primarily because we believe Workday is taking steps to meaningfully improve its positioning with AI that could ultimately drive stable and improving revenue growth beyond 13-14%. There are signs of stabilization and improvement in key metrics over the last four quarters (albeit with some noise tied to M&A and AI), likely in part because cohort renewals have stabilized (we believe

the 3-year cohorts renewing in 2023 and 2024 were particularly under pressure given overbuying in 2020 and 2021). We look to gauge to what extent Workday's expanded platform can drive improved wallet share capture as customers assess next-gen o ff erings in the O ffi ce of the CFO.

Workday gained outsized share between 2010-2020 in the HCM market, as its cloud-native platform o ff ered performance and cost bene fi ts over legacy competitors. During that decade, Workday also introduced new modules to build a broader back o ffi ce suite: this includes Payroll in 2011, Learning in 2016, and Planning in 2018. Although Workday launched Financial Management in 2008, the Financials Suite (FINS+) remains ~25% of revenue. Consistent with the rest of SaaS, Workday's growth has slowed from >30% pre-COVID to 14.5% in FY26E: this is a combination of 1) post COVID normalization, where customers went from a period of elevated buying and hiring to period of heightened budget scrutiny and layo ff s; and 2) mechanical share gains slowing.

More speci fi c to HCM , Workday mechanically gained share as the industry transitioned from on prem (where Workday had no exposure) to cloud (where Workday had outsized share), and COVID resulted in above-trend adoption. Simultaneous with the cloud transition, legacy competitors have also introduced cloud products, including SAP SuccessFactors, ADP Workforce, and Oracle HCM. While both these trends apply to the SaaS application space broadly, we believe the core HCM TAM has seen outsized pressure: industry estimates from Gartner suggest that HCM is in the top quartile of most penetrated with more than 80% to the cloud. Additionally, the TAM screens as smaller relative to categories such as CRM and ERP, and our industry conversations suggest it is generally less strategic or less of a focus for AI-driven productivity gains.

The ERP TAM in which Workday's FINS+ o ff ering competes is less penetrated (~40%); the business risk associated with an ERP implementation is enough to drive companies to delay them, and data/compliance laws are headwinds. The competitive landscape is nuanced, including new peers such as OneStream (OS, covered by Adam Hotchkiss) with high win rates and pricing pressure from incumbents like SAP and Oracle. International ERP is particularly di ffi cult to compete in, both because of legal/compliance di ff erences and entrenched international players. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

launched its fi rst AI product in 2015, but started meaningfully leveling up their AI strategy over the past year. Their strategy is to use Workday's consolidated data with a semantic model on top to give context for AI actions and provide more customized experiences. For example, in the future, a job candidate could have a 'personal' AI recruiter and share feedback with them after the interview. Reaching this strategic vision and preempting disruption from AI-native competitors has required signi fi cant rethinking of Workday's tech foundations. This included hiring a new CTO and President (both from Google), re-architecting the platform to make their data foundations stronger (including partnerships with Snow fl ake and Databricks), pursuing tuck-in M&A, and experimenting with fl ex credits as a complement to their traditionally subscription-based model. Workday has >$150mn in AI ARR (as of F2Q26, more than 3X

yoy); 15+ out-of-the-box agents; a hyper scale, real-time, zero-copy data platform in 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 Workday Data Cloud; 35% of customer expansions including at least one AI product; and >75% of core customers using Workday Illuminate AI. In addition, according to the company, it will gain 3K connections shipped through the proposed Pipedream acquisition (pending, expected close before Jan 31, 2026), which would otherwise have taken years to build.

In the context of the core drivers of the business being less additive than before, we highlight the following areas of opportunity: If Workday di ff erentiates itself in AI such that it is able to capture new value through 1. being a central pane of glass for managing HCM-related or O ffi ce-of-the-CFO related agents, it could become the orchestration layer for HR Delivery where outsized value accrues Workday's international business remains smaller than peers at 25% of revenues, 2. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 compared to Salesforce's 34% and SAP's non-EMEA revenues of 52%.

The company could surprise to the upside on ERP share if vendor consolidation 3. outweighs feature-completeness, and if they are able to realize new FINSfi rst wins. Their front-line worker strategy could allow them to continue to take share of HCM 4. in previously under-penetrated categories Even as Workday's revenue growth has slowed into the teens, there remains 5. potential for outsized margin expansion. Workday benchmarks well compared to large cap peers. Workday in particular has begun to address its low GAAP margins and high stock based comp, with less dilution in recent years and a ramping buyback. GAAP SG&A likely has room for improvement, and P&T expense will become more e ffi cient with the rollout of innovation centers in EMEA and continued optimization of their employee base.

In an upside case, Workday has the potential to look like Intuit in the 2017-2019 era, when that company exited a period of macro headwinds (in Intuit's case two bad tax seasons), re-invented itself (in Intuit's case through major divestitures), and was able to re-accelerate growth even as margins continued to improve. Intuit became a compelling EPS and EBIT ramp story that drove a subsequent re-rating.

We assume coverage with a Neutral rating and a 12-month price target of $238. We apply a 20x Non-GAAP multiple on our SNTM Non-GAAP EPS estimates. WDAY performed generally in line with the NDX from the time of the IPO through the peak in December 2021. Since then, the stock is down ~20%, underperforming the NDX by >55pp. With Workday entering its maturation phase with line of sight to sustained >20%/>40% Adj./GAAP EPS CAGR, we believe P/E is a more appropriate valuation metric than EV/Sales. We use adj. EPS as a valuation metric given a more stable history and ongoing M&A, but note earnings quality is improving driving faster GAAP EPS growth compared to non-GAAP. We consider a group of scaled large cap peers. WDAY trades at 20.3x NTM Non-GAAP EPS, vs. the peer median of 27.4x (P/E/G 0.5x vs. peer median 1.2x). We recognize this valuation vs. growth

disconnect and look for signs that Workday's AI strategy is driving growth to become more positive on a multiple rerating.

We assume coverage of Figma with a Neutral rating (unchanged) and a 12-month price target of $40. We view Figma as a leading asset in collaborative design for product development, with particularly di ff erentiated IP in synchronizing changes across multiple users and its web-based front end. This technical foundation has supported the platform's expansion beyond design into adjacent work fl ows across the product development lifecycle, with products like FigJam, Dev Mode, Figma Sites, and Figma Buzz. As a result, Figma has captured a wider range of product development personas, with non-designers already representing two-thirds of MAUs. Long-term fundamentals are compelling, where we see a multi-year opportunity for Figma to deepen wallet share within large accounts (Customers with $10K+ ARR), expand into adjacent work fl ows, and capture new revenue streams from AI (Figma Make). Please see our August 2025 note for more details about the company.

Scaling revenue contribution from AI. Figma is currently focused on AI adoption without explicit monetization to o ff set inferencing costs, driving margin compression over the next 12-24 months. Early indicators are encouraging, with total paid customers increasing to 540K in 3Q25 (vs. 450K in 1Q25), driven in part by Figma Make adoption, and 30% of $100K+ ARR Customers now creating in Figma Make weekly. While the product is still early (GA in July 2025) and the consumption-based credit model is still evolving, Figma Make may translate to more material upsell, seat expansion, and incremental usage-based revenue.

personas. Prior product launches such as Dev mode have demonstrated Figma's ability to drive material revenue uplift through cross sell, with NRR reaccelerating from 122% to 134% in F24. However, it is unclear to us whether new o ff erings introduced in May 2025 - such as Figma Buzz, which targets more peripheral personas involved in product development like marketers - can achieve comparable levels of adoption or upsell / cross-sell momentum to prior product cycles.

Better-than-anticipated pricing power: Figma implemented its fi rst pricing and packaging changes in March 2025, introducing multi-product seats bundles and 20-33% price increase for Full Seat licenses (+33% for Professional / +22% for Organization / +20% for Enterprise). We will fully anniversary the pricing and packaging tailwind by 1Q26. Given the company's limited operating history with pricing and packaging changes, we have limited visibility around customer price sensitivity - particularly as industry conversations suggest Figma is already perceived as premium-priced. However, should these changes be absorbed with minimal friction, it would signal greater pricing power and contribute more meaningfully to revenue.

We are Neutral rated and lower our 12-month price target to $40 (vs. $54 prior), based on 16x EV/sales (down from 20x on refreshed comps), a ~20% discount to NET and CRWD on EV/sales/growth on SNTM sales growth given that Figma is earlier in scaling and in its platform evolution. We also include an updated share count that re fl ects full 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 potential dilution, to be consistent with the rest of our coverage. Key downside risks: 1) Pressure from newly introduced pricing and packaging, or intensifying price competition, 2) Product / market fi t misalignment, 3) Escalated AI investments may pressure margins without su ffi cient top-line contribution, 4) Increased competition from AI-native players.

Key upside risks: 1) Better-than-anticipated pricing power, 2) Outsized momentum from adoption of emerging products and expansion into design-adjacent personas, 3) Earlier-than-expected AI monetization, and 4) Minimal disruption risk from AI-native players. Our FY25/26/27 revenue estimates remain largely unchanged and we introduce an FY28 revenue estimate of $1,848mn.

We assume coverage of Navan at a $30 price target (unchanged, 68% upside) and a Buy rating . We view Navan as a compelling share gain story as the fi rst scaled alternative to legacy travel and expense tools. We expect to see an elevated pace of share gain over the next 3 years as companies solve for AI adoption and cost controls in their back o ffi ce tools, at the same time as Navan expands its network of travel inventory. Furthermore, Navan has the opportunity to grow beyond their historical sweet spot of mid-market and tech-forward customers to move both upmarket (enterprise traction only just beginning), downmarket (still under penetrated in SMBs, new product-led motion will help), and internationally (crucial to addressing more global organizations). Taken together, we expect ~15% customer growth, which when combined with ~110% NRR and some contribution from secular/TAM growth should drive a sustainable 25% CAGR over the next 3-5 years.

For more details on the company, see our November report (link) and our Jan 7 NDR report (link). Catalyst Path: Navan is down 28% since its IPO price of $25. In our view, the underperformance of the stock re fl ects three concerns, each of which have catalysts that could improve sentiment and allow the stock to rerate toward our view of intrinsic value. We highlight the following catalysts for the stock:

Establishing a robust operating history in the public markets. Navan announced a 1. CFO transition in December and operates in the macro-sensitive business travel market. We believe the company has detailed forecasting algorithms and a good baseline understanding of its customers' spending patters that will help it beat and raise even in a period of executive transition. Our research colleagues' positive views on both the economy and industry-speci fi c backdrop inform our con fi dence our base case that the business travel TAM should continue to grow. Speci fi cally, our economists expect strong global growth in 2026 (2.8% vs. the Street at 2.5%) and our airlines and lodging teams expect acceleration in airline capacity growth and RevPAR growth, respectively, into 2026. Progress on margins: Navan expects to be FCF breakeven in FY27 (ends Jan 2027). 2. 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953

Consistent with other 30%+ Software models, we believe the company will realize a more material in fl ection in FCF post its current investment cycle. Navan's LTV:CAC is >3.0x vs. median app software peers at ~2.0x. - Additional large customer wins: Navan recently announced GE and Visa as 3. customers. We believe being publicly-traded and progress in launching enterprise features will help with more marquee customer wins, in addition to existing fl agship customers such as Canva.

We are Buy rated on Navan. Our (unchanged) 12-month Price Target of $30 is based on 7.8x Q5-Q8 EV / Sales. This implies a NTM EV / Sales / Growth multiple of 0.30x. Key downside risks include: travel spend volatility associated with the macroeconomic cycle or natural disasters/geopolitical events, yield contraction, AI native disruption, elongated path to pro fi tability.

We, Gabriela Borges, CFA, Maura Hager, Noah Naparst, Max Gamperl, Callie Valenti, Selina Zhang and Praachi Arora, hereby certify that all of the views expressed in this report accurately re fl ect our personal views about the subject company or companies and its or their securities. We also certify that no part of our compensation was, is or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the speci fi c recommendations or views expressed in this report. Unless otherwise stated, the individuals listed on the cover page of this report are analysts in Goldman Sachs' Global Investment Research division.

Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.
