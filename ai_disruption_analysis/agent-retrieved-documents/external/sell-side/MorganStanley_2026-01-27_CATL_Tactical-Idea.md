We believe the share price will rise relative to the industry over the next 15 days. This is because the stock has traded off recently, making short term valuation much more compelling. We believe the market is overconcerned about the company's margin pressure amid cost inflation, which will be passed through. CATL proved its capability in passing costs through in the prior lithium upcycle. We expect its lithium mines to resume production in the near term. For the longer term, the company has strategically acquired cobalt, phosphate, copper and lithium mines directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, to mitigate any potential material inflation. We believe its earnings will remain intact amid the current material inflation, along with its sufficient low-cost inventory in 1Q26. We remain Equal-weight on CATL-H, as CATL-A's valuation is more attractive. We estimate that there is about a 70% to 80% (or "very likely") probability for the scenario.

Estimated probabilities are illustrative and assigned subjectively based on our assessment of the likelihood of the scenario. Morgan Stanley Asia Limited+

Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold and sell. Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone. In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice. An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations. M
