January 8, 2026 EARNINGS PREVIEW

For the Third Party Logistics (3PL) Group, freight Indicators suggest the market is transitioning from contraction to early normalization, but we believe recovery remains uneven. Spot rate indices have largely bottomed, but absolute pricing remains well below mid-cycle levels, signaling the market may be in slow recovery. Demand has yet to show clear inflection, and we expect 4Q25 to reflect stabilization rather than a true recovery, with 2026 dependent on administrative policy and the pace of macro normalization. The consumer economy appears steady, but fragile, while the industrial economy remains in contraction, with our base case for modest recovery later this year. For domestic brokerage, our focus in 2026 is on regulatory-driven trucking supply exit. We are benchmarking high-single-digit percent tightening as we move through the year, which could pull the truckload market out of recession, but that would be an acute near-term headwind for broker intermediaries, especially without demand-driven spot opportunity to offset. AI- and technology-driven automation offers respite, but investors should consider that execution still requires significant

change management talent. For global freight forwarding, we also see meaningful policy risk, most notably around tariff, that could bring more import volatility and should favor larger 3PLs with broader capabilities.

· Demand remains the critical swing factor, with volumes steady but lacking a clear catalyst . Consumer spending has proven resilient and industrial production has seemingly surpassed the deepest contractionary phase, but visibility into a broad-based restocking cycle remains limited. Housing and manufacturing activity continue to act as headwinds for the overall freight environment, though early signs of housing stabilization, mortgage portability, and potential rate cuts could spur incremental volume growth in 2026. In the absence of a demand-led upcycle, organic growth for 3PLs is likely to be modest and primarily driven by share gains and mix optimization.

· Capacity dynamics are improving in trucking, emphasized by growing regulatory enforcement . Heightened regulatory scrutiny within the trucking industry has the potential to accelerate capacity exits, particularly among smaller, undercapitalized carriers and owneroperators already operating near or at break-even levels. If enforcement holds, supply contraction should ultimately be constructive for the freight market; however, in the near term, it raises purchased transportation costs and creates a challenging margin environment for brokers as capacity tightens faster than demand recovers-the latter being important for profitable spot opportunity creation, in our view.

· Brokerage margins likely to face a squeeze before improving, reflecting the late-cycle winner nature of the business . As spot rates stabilize and trend higher, brokers are expected to face several quarters of margin compression as higher carrier costs flow faster than customer pricing resets. This dynamic is most acute for brokers with high contract exposure and less technology leverage to headcount (i.e. capacity). While rising rates are a necessary precursor to recovery, margin expansion is more likely to materialize toward the back end of 2026, once contract pricing catches up, in our view.

· Investment Conclusions: 2026 is looking to be a year of gradual improvement rather than a sharp rebound, in our view. We expect net revenue growth across the brokers to be modest, with margin recovery (if any) being back-half weighted. While the fundamental supplydemand backdrop seems to be improving, the cycle remains atypical, and a sustained recovery will likely require clearer evidence of demand acceleration alongside continued capacity contraction. Exogenous policy risk is a big factor this cycle, and we think that counsels caution for the intermediary group as a whole. High-quality forwarder Expeditors International (EXPD, $156.90, Hold) tends to weather disruption well and gain share in times of volatility due to consistent service, economies of purchasing scale, global reach and optionality, and its leading customs clearance apparatus, but we think risk-adjusted valuation is fair at current levels. Domestic Broker RXO (RXO, $13.69, Hold) faces gross margin challenges as discussed above; we do see some opportunity to follow the C.H. Robinson optimization playbook, but AI

deployment is a show-me story, not a given, and we think structural valuation divergence between the two makes sense given the divergence in recent operational results. At closer to $13/share, we could see trading opportunity in RXO all else equal, but thematically, we remain on the sidelines at current levels. Micro-cap Universal Logistics (ULH, $15.96, Hold) is a hodgepodge of business units, but its core contract logistics business has a slow sales cycle and outsized exposure to the laggard automotive vertical; other divisions lack scale and/or meaningful near-term margin improvement opportunity, in our view. Our lone Buy recommendations are C.H. Robinson (CHRW, $166.73, Buy) and GXO Logistics (GXO, $54.97, Buy), which both have different, but pronounced competitive advantages in technology, underscoring their scalability, secular organic growth, and market share opportunities.

· Global forwarding fundamentals remains mixed, with air stabilizing and ocean still challenged . Airfreight demand has been supported by time-sensitive shipments across select verticals and a constructive supply backdrop, with rates remaining above prepandemic levels despite volatility. Contrarily, ocean freight continues to face significant pressure from excess capacity and soft demand following the unwind of front-loaded imports. Consequently, forwarding segment fundamentals should see continued headwinds near term, followed by gradual normalization into late 2026.

· Global forwarding also faces meaningful tail risk this year from policy and volatile geopolitical conditions . These risks include a looming Supreme Court decision on the IEEPA justification for the Trump Administration's Tariffs-including the de minimis exemption closure. We see a better than 50% chance of a narrow ruling against the administration, which likely creates further trade uncertainty, but could also spark another wave of inventory front loading before tariffs are re-enacted through other administrative or legislative channels. We think impact would be most acute for airfreight, at least initially, assuming a reinstatement of the de minimis import exemption, the closure of which has throttled trans-pacific freight flow, particularly for lower-value e-commerce merchandise. Like trucking, we believe the ocean container freight market is structurally over-supplied. But rationalization catalysts are less clear cut than in trucking (which are themselves murky). That said, geopolitical disruption this year in the Straight of Taiwan or Middle Eastern sea lanes could change that and tighten supply again

in a hurry, in our view-an important consideration for investors given a tumultuous start to the international relations calendar. Large, diversified forwarders with global reach and expertise, as well as robust customs capabilities, should continue to gain share as global supply chains and trade policy remain in flux. But the diversity and unpredictability of outcomes has us seeking more fundamental opportunity to balance risk and open new positions in this sub-sector.

C.H. Robinson is the dominant incumbent operator in a market that benefits from secular outsourcing trends and historically tight transportation capacity. After running into some growth stagnation as a result of its sheer size and seeing new and existing competitors make a push for share, the company embarked upon a five-year, $1bn technology investment plan at the beginning of 2019, aimed at driving better capacity procurement, more efficient operations, and faster organic growth, but results were slow to materialize, in our view. In late 2023, the company launched an initiative under new CEO Dave Bozeman to accelerate productivity and "eliminate waste," with more focus on processes, performance measurement, and accountability to better tie targeted IT investments with profitability. Technology is playing an *RXO Multiple is based on our 2027 EBITDA estimate Source: Factset & Stifel Estimates

increasingly important strategic and competitive role in the industry, and we think the company's Navisphere platform ranks among the bestavailable systems today. The question, in our view, is whether C.H. Robinson can leverage that technology to consistently grow operating income faster than net revenues in its core NAST business and whether it can deliver smooth M&A integration and maintain margins at peercomparable levels in Forwarding. Free cash flow remains ample and the company's balance sheet remains robust, in our view.

Expeditors is a strong operator with good people and processes, in our view, which has helped to drive strong profitability relative to peers. Historically, the company has been regarded as a leader in IT and has made incremental updates to its legacy platform while others have struggled with large-scale software and process overhaul plans. This strategy has allowed the company to take opportunistic market share, in our view, but over time, may leave Expeditors with a generational technology gap as certain competitors optimize new cutting-edge platforms and services. The company's renewed market share focus (Europe is a large target area), strong culture and competitive cost efficiency advantages present opportunities for top- and bottom-line growth over the next 2-3 years, but longer term, increased competition, increasing market volatility, rapidly changing technology, and shifting global supply chains could present challenges to the company's growth, margins, and strategic positioning.

GXO is a top provider of contract logistics services that we expect to benefit from three themes that have only grown in importance over the past several years: automation, e-commerce and outsourcing. GXO prides itself on offering its clientele the latest technologies in automation, lowering client spend and improving operations. We expect the company to continue to expand its reach in the higher-value, high-touch contract logistics offerings. With industry tailwinds, strong financial positioning and strong management, we expect GXO to trade at a premium to peers and the general transportation ecosystem.

RXO predominantly operates within the truckload brokerage industry. Other services will include managed transportation, last-mile and freight forwarding. Our rating is based on our assumptions of market growth and RXO's ability to continue growing market share and serve its diverse clientele. We believe RXO has a technological advantage relative to peers that will support above-market growth and lead to multiple expansion as the standalone company matures.

Universal Logistics Holdings has undergone significant transformation over the past few years following major acquisitions in LINC Logistics and Westport. After successful corporate streamlining and reorganization, margins have stabilized and the company has resumed making acquisitions. Deal flow so far has been on the smaller side, but eventually, the company looks to diversify its full-service logistics business across multiple industries, reducing its historical dependence on the auto industry. At present, though, the company is still leveraged to industrial America, particularly the automobile industry, and significant supply chain disruption in that end market remains a headwind. With its limited float and small market cap, ULH is not for everyone, but we believe the stock does offer meaningful potential upside for the patient or flexible investor, especially if the company is taken private or sold.

C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., founded in 1905, is one of the largest third-party logistics companies in North America. The company is a global provider of multi-modal transportation services and logistics solutions, serving 119,000 customers around the world via the singlelargest network of transportation and logistics capacity in North America boasting over 78,000 contract carriers. The company has been investing heavily in technology, and has achieved what we believe to be one of the most advanced and capable platforms in the marketplace, and is leveraging this technology to drive sales and operational efficiency throughout the organization.

Expeditors is a global logistics company headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company employs trained professionals in 176 fullservice offices and numerous satellite locations located on six continents linked into a seamless worldwide network through an integrated information management system. Services include the consolidation or forwarding of air and ocean freight, customs brokerage, vendor consolidation, cargo insurance, time-definite transportation, order management, warehousing distribution and customized logistics solutions.

GXO Logistics, Inc. is the world's largest pure-play Contract Logistics provider. GXO Logistics was formerly a division within global transportation and logistics powerhouse XPO Logistics, which was spun off on August 2, 2021. The goal of the spinoff, in our view, was to simplify the company's (then division's) commercial offering and investment story, as well as to pursue a tailored capital structure and growth strategy, independent of its former parent. Services now encompass a broad array of value-added warehousing operations, mostly contained with the 'four walls' of a warehouse facility. GXO Logistics operates via an asset-light model with global reach, but is focused primarily on the North American and European markets, which comprise the vast majority of revenue. In our view, the company's competitive advantage is centered around its vertical expertise, particularly in the high-growth and difficult-to-manage e-commerce segment.

RXO, Inc. is a leading brokered transportation platform defined by cutting-edge technology and a nimble, asset-light business model, with the largest component being core truck brokerage. Including the company's recent acquisition of Coyote Logistics from UPS, RXO is now the third-largest broker of full truckload freight transportation in the U.S. Over 60% of 2023 gross revenue was generated by truck brokerage;

the remainder consisted of brokered services for managed transportation, last mile and freight forwarding. RXO is led by a strong leadership team of executives that have deep experience in their respective fields, having previously served in senior roles with industry leaders. The truck brokerage business has a variable cost structure with a strong free cash flow conversion and a demonstrated track record of generating high ROIC. Shippers create demand for the RXO service, their freight is then placed with qualified independent carriers using RXO's proprietary digital technology, RXO Connect, and customer freight is priced on either a contract or a spot basis. In 2023, RXO's consolidated operating revenue was nearly $4.0b, generated by the company's ~7,400 team members (~5,600 full-time and part-time, and ~1,800 temporary workers) throughout 196 locations.

Universal Logistics Holdings, Inc., founded as Universal Am-Can in 1981, is a large asset-light provider of customized transportation and logistics solutions that operates throughout the United States and parts of Mexico, Canada, and Colombia. Based in Warren, Michigan, its transportation and logistics solutions include: value-added services, dedicated, truckload transportation, and intermodal. Universal's owneroperator-based fleet features flatbeds, hotshots, specialized vans, and specialized flatbeds for heavy hauling and over-dimensional business. Formerly known as Universal Truckload Services, Inc., the company acquired LINC Logistics in 2012, and in 2016 changed its name and ticker to reflect its evolution from an over-the-road trucking business into a full-service provider of asset-light logistics solutions.

C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (CHRW)

Risks to our target price include an inability to achieve anticipated growth through potential acquisitions and organic growth, potential to overpay for acquired companies as well as failure to retain talent under a change in control, poorly-executed integration of acquisitions, increased competition in the asset-light brokerage arena, shippers' decisions to insource transportation and logistics functions or deal directly with asset-based carriers, reduced freight volumes stemming from economic downturn, reduction in available capacity, trade wars or disruption to global trade, and equity dilution from potential future capital raises.

Risks include slowdown in Asia-U.S. trade volume, slowdown in intra-Asia trade volumes, international armed conflict, failure of growth investments to materialize in share gains, more aggressive pricing from competitors, under-investment in technology, a misguided or poorly executed acquisition, near-term carrier rate volatility, and a global economic recession.

Risks to our target price include a global economic slowdown limiting customer spend, escalating cost pressure not captured by its contractual framework, increased competition from industry players and potential insourcing from customers and acquisition-related integration challenges. RXO, Inc. (RXO)

Risks to our target price include macroeconomic weakness, which could limit upside growth potential if spot and contract brokerage volumes dry up. Increased competition from new entrants with disruptive new technologies may come to the market, leading existing players to price aggressively in order to win share. Alternatively, expansion into brokerage from asset-based carriers may erode share if shippers are more inclined to single-source asset and asset-light strategies. Failure to innovate fast enough, or development and investment in technologies that ultimately are not utilized or adopted may see RXO lose its competitive edge. There is transportation capacity volatility risk; a material tightening of the environment could cause significant margin pressure as purchased transportation costs increase. Alternatively, a significant and unexpected tightening could lead to missed opportunities if the company is unable to procure sufficient capacity and pivot fast enough to spot volumes. Additionally, new acquisitions may be margin

dilutive, may bring fewer synergies than planned, or integration may cause operational disruption, reputational damage, and loss of management focus, especially if not properly executed.

Risks to our target price include economic downturn, competitive pressure from new and existing market entrants including digital freight brokers, rapid increases in the cost of transportation capacity, a lack of availability of transportation capacity, reclassification of independent contractor owner-operators, poorly-executed acquisitions and integration strategy, an inability to recruit or retain agents, rising claims expenses and exposure to third-party tort liability, labor strike, a reduction in business due to potential tariffs and trade wars, reduced crossborder volumes as a result of changes to NAFTA, and reduction or loss of business of a major customer.

Consumer spending held stable for most of 2025, keeping the economy afloat and buoying GDP. But reversion to services spending and lower corporate spending has translated to less freight activity. More recently, consumer confidence has weakened significantly as consumers expect higher-for-longer inflation and interest rates. Inflation remains elevated and above Fed targets; confidence remains historically low and real spending on discretionary goods has been cautious. Despite nominal spending rising, the combination of elevated interest rates, reduced savings, and continued inflationary pressure is likely to further pressure consumption in 2026. We believe Fed easing may provide some relief but is unlikely to significantly spur higher spending.

Retailer inventories are well-below historical norms, but we believe scar tissue from the 2021-2022 inventory glut remain top-of-mind for many shippers. Moreover, tariff and trade policy changes paired with cautious consumer expectations have led retailers, particularly smaller less sophisticated players, to slow or even pause ordering. High income households have kept spending stable as strong stock markets and rising asset values have driven discretionary purchases. But lower-income households have faced pressures from rising costs and a tough labor market. Despite retail sales reflecting stable trends, sentiment tends to lead spending, and given recent sharp declines, we view weakening sales as a primary risk.

Exhibit 7: Housing Market Index

The manufacturing economy remains soft, dampening freight demand in sectors like bulk raw materials, components, and industrial equipment.. The ISM PMI has been in contractionary territory since March. Production has been more resilient, but employment, prices, and new orders remain challenged. We believe lower interest rates may be key to kickstarting an industrial recovery, but inflationary pressure is a hurdle. Our base case is for the ISM to recover toward the middle of the year, but modestly.

The housing market seemingly hit the bottom in 2025, with the single-family housing market index reaching its lowest point since summer 2012 (excluding-COVID). Housing construction and new household formation have been stagnant for several quarters, offering little help to freight activity through this prolonged freight trough. Recently, existing home sales have began to trend off the bottom and mortgage applications have been rising which are early signs of improvement. Given one-third of total domestic freight tonnage is related to home building and furnishing, any improvement here would be a major positive for volumes in 2026.

Exhibit 9: DAT Load-to-Truck Ratio Y/Y Change

The Cass shipments index is on track for an FY25 decline of ~6% y/y as demand headwinds continue. Demand conditions in the fourth quarter remained steady, but we still lack a clear inflection catalyst. Consumer spending has proven resilient, and industrial demand is no longer deteriorating, but visibility into a broad-based restocking cycle remains limited. In the absence of sustained demand growth, we think volume growth is likely to be company-specific, driven by share gains and cross-selling initiatives rather than a macro-driven freight expansion.

Despite the continuation of a sluggish demand backdrop, the load-to-truck ratio has been creeping higher. With November's reading at a 5.6, there is still some way to go before reaching the 8:1 'sweet spot' for brokers, where we believe new spot opportunities begin to emerge. If capacity continues to exit the market from rising regulatory enforcement and the upcoming maintenance cycle, we expect to see a significant improvement in the monthly load-to-truck ratios.

· Sequentially, spot rates have consistently moved higher in the last few weeks. The move has been modest off a depressed base, but we think the consistency is an important factor. Spot rates have reflected sequential upward movement in the fourth quarter, which is significant because in the last 3+ years, we have only seen episodic uplifts that quickly unwound. · Operators that have leaned heavily into productivity and efficiency initiatives should start to see incremental margin improvement faster off a lower cost base if market recovery is better than expected . Consequently, margin resilience in the near term will be driven more by mix optimization and procurement discipline rather than headline rate trends, in our view. · Upward rate momentum is positive for the overall freight market, but pressures brokerage gross margins in the near term . If current trends hold, brokers will likely face several quarters of margin pressure from rising transportation costs before pricing resets.

· Brokerages are later cycle beneficiaries, limiting upside in the earlier phases of a cycle recovery . While gradual positive indicators are pointing to an early stage of recovery, we believe this is a rather unusual freight cycle and hard to predict given the various underlying dynamics. If the current trend of gradual upward rate momentum against accelerated capacity contraction continues, brokers will likely face a margin squeeze for several quarters.

· U.S. Import levels trending lower as pretariff front-loading subsides. While the year started off with strong imports as shippers front-loaded ahead of potential tariffs, imports slowed in the back half of the year. Loaded imports at West Coast ports have declined (12%), (13%), and (11%) year-over-year in the past three reportable months, respectively. · Ocean Forwarding will remain challenged by wave of new supply and soft demand . Ocean rates have been falling as one-off demand catalysts have subsided and an influx of capacity has started to enter the market. We expect the segment to face a prolonged downturn until eventually finding an equilibrium, unless geopolitical disruptions constrict global shipping lanes.

· Airfreight remains a mixed but stabilizing contributor . Air volumes have been supported by growing demand for time sensitive shipments across select verticals while cost-conscious shipper behavior continues to cap broader growth. Rates have been volatile but remain above pre-COVID levels as demand continues to slightly outpace supply.

· Net revenue growth expected to be slow but positive in 2026. Net revenue growth has been relatively slow in this downcycle as increasing costs have been met with softer demand. 2023 marked an especially bad year for the 3PLs with ocean and air freight exposure as rates plummeted following the boom in 2022. We expect a moderate stabilization into 2026 as rates gradually improve and market conditions normalize. · Net Revenue expansion will be more execution driven than price led . In the near term, net-revenue expansion is more mix/execution driven rather than price-led as contract pricing is only inching higher and spot markets continue to be volatile. · Gross Margins expected to be squeezed for the next several quarters before improving in second half. If current trends sustain, we expect 3PL margins to come under pressure before seeing an incremental tailwind.

· We expect recent cost initiatives to help sustain some level of margins despite rising transportation costs, limiting downside risk in the near term. Given the recent heightened focus on lowering the overall cost base across the industry, we expect the brokers that have successfully shed unnecessary costs to have some level of sustained margins during the period of rising purchased transportation costs.

CH Robinson has been a clear outperformer in the 3PL space, in our view, showcasing strong productivity through the 'Robinson Operating Model,' which is built on lean principles and daily cadence metrics. Despite a challenging market, C.H. Robinson is demonstrating progress on the operational targets laid out at investor day all whilst reducing its headcount by 15% YTD. The new model aims to automate manual tasks and leverage digital tools to improve cost to hire and dynamic pricing. In the last two years, the operating model has driven 30% of productivity gains and management expects to deliver single-digit productivity gains annually going forward.

The drop-trailer service now accounts for ~12% of NAST truckload volume, making C.H. one of the largest providers in the space. NAST launched short haul and crossborder offering in 2Q25 to meet the evolving customer needs · Shipments per person/Day: Since 2022, shipments per person per day have increased at a double-digit pace, allowing meaningful headcount reductions while productivity improves. · AI Adoption . As part of the technology transformation at C.H., the company has deployed over 30 generative AI agents which collectively perform over 3 million shipping tasks such as quoting, order entry, tender acceptance and invoicing.

· Mid-Cyle Margin Target . The company is targeting a ~40% margin within NAST which has largely been achieved (3Q25 print of 39.2%) despite the unfavorable market backdrop. The structural transformation is delivering material results, and given the success within NAST, management intends to heighten its focus on Global Forwarding to implement a similar strategy.

Despite it not being the company's primary segment, C.H. Robinson is one of the largest global air and ocean forwarders. Management is leveraging nearshoring and expanding targeted trade lanes to gain additional market share within the space. · Ocean. The ocean segment remains pressured by lower spot rates and excess capacity. Last quarter's AGP/shipment declined nearly 28% y/y while volumes dipped 7%. Management expects near term headwinds to persist within the ocean space through at least 4Q from tempered demand and the recent influx of capacity, but remains confident in a more stable and profitable 2026 from structural improvements. · Air & Customs. The airfreight and customs part of the portfolio have helped offset broader ocean weakness. Airfreight demand has been gradually improving with last quarter's AGP/metric ton increasing 17% against a 10% drop in volume. The customs segment has benefited from rising demand for compliance and value-added services given heightened trade volatility.

· Mid-Cycle Margin Target of 30% . Despite a cyclical downturn, the company's recent techenabled transformation initiatives have allowed margin resilience and pricing agility as the segment's productivity has risen 55% since 2022. Management believes they are still in the early innings of the transformation, allowing ample upside opportunity going forward for further margin improvement and stabilization despite broader macro volatility, in our view.

· Earnings versus Expectations. CH. Robinson has delivered earnings above expectations since new leadership took over. The company has exceeded the street's expectations since Q124 and continues to outpace industry growth. The company has deployed significant self-help initiatives that have generated margin improvement despite the market's lack of cooperation, in our view. · Guidance & Outlook: Last quarter, C.H. Robinson upped its 2026 operating income guidance by $50mm, or ~5%, after continued outperformance in the market. Importantly, the lower end of guidance of $965mm assumes 0% market growth and the upper end ($1.04bn) assumes 5% market growth. The company also guided to NAST AGP/shipment to come in flat to +2% while GF AGP/shipment reset to 2H23 levels of down 10%.

· Updated Estimates . We are modelling 4Q25 EPS of $1.13, which is in line with Street consensus and brings FY25 EPS to $4.99. C.H. Robinson's low-end FY26 guidance yields an EPS of $6.00, which assumes zero market growth. Our FY26 estimate of $6.04 falls closer to midpoint of guidance, as we expect the company to continue outpacing the market. Furthermore, we expect the company to continue making incremental productivity improvements throughout the remainder of this year which should further drive margin improvements, especially within Global forwarding.

RXO's truck brokerage revenue doubled in the second quarter as the integration of recently-acquired Coyote Logistics has progressed smoothly. While revenue growth has been robust, profits are on the softer side due to high restructuring costs and a soft freight market. The company has seen strong growth in LTL volumes since the Coyote acquisition, which now makes up 32% of total truck brokerage volumes. LTL continues to generate attractive contribution margins and is expected to remain a key growth area within the broader platform. Contrarily, truckload volumes have been declining as the company has shed lower margin business to optimize pricing and lane strategies.

Sources: Company Reports/Presentations, Factset, Stifel Estimates 19

RXO has been investing ~$100mm per year in technology, which has in turn boosted productivity by 45% in the last two years using 'loads per person per day' as a metric. The company's cost initiatives have helped limit downside in this freight recession, but as the market improves, these initiatives should help drive incremental growth at a faster rate.

· Coyote Logistics Integration . RXO completed the acquisition in September 2024 for $1.025bn in cash, funded primarily by equity raising. The acquisition contributed $796mm in revenues for FY24 but also resulted in $43mm of acquisition related costs to the year. The company is on track for a full $70mm cost synergy target, comprised of $60mm of Opex savings and $10mm of Capex for the full year 2025. · Outlook . The company has been expanding its LTL business, with the most recent quarter reflecting ~40% LTL volume growth. Management believes LTL could make up 50% or more of the total mix, stabilizing the segment and boosting gross margins. RXO guided to margins between 12% and 13% for the quarter as TL gross profit/load remains under pressure and overall softer market conditions persist.

Includes Last mile, managed transportation, and freight forwarding. · Last Mile (65% of segment revenue) . The last mile business has achieved four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth driven by share gains with existing customers and new wins from cross-selling opportunity from the Coyote acquisition. The growth is expected to decelerate following these onboardings, but management remains confident in the segment's growth trajectory. · Managed Transportation (28% of segment revenue) . The segment's performance has faced headwinds from declining automotive volumes, to which it has high exposure. These headwinds are expected to persist in the near term until the industry sees a recovery. · Freight Forwarding (16% of segment revenue) . Forwarding revenues have been pretty volatile in past quarters as the evolving trade policies continue to shape global trade patterns.

Sources: Company Reports/Presentations, Factset, Stifel Estimates *Stifel estimates are relatively unchanged from the recent 2026 outlook changes, Street consensus

· Estimate Changes. Management guided to 4Q EBITDA between $20mm-$30mm which at the midpoint assumes a single digit decline in brokerage volumes and a continuation of softer market conditions. Management also noted the low point of guidance assumes buy-rate escalation with no offsetting spot opportunities, while the upper range assumes modest gross profit recovery from routing guide breakdowns, which would create accretive spot opportunities. The company expects brokerage gross margins to fall between 12% and 13% which would reflect flat y/y change. We are modeling 4Q EPS of ($0.03), a touch below street consensus of ($0.02). · 2026 Outlook . Despite the company's efforts to grow LTL volumes to offset current TL pressures, an earnings recovery in 2026 remains largely dependent on a TL turn, in addition to productivity gains from AI investments. Furthermore, current market conditions are expected to be largely unfavorable for brokers for the next several quarters, likely hindering any near-term earnings recovery, in our view.

Expeditors is a cash-rich company with strong margins against low leverage. It ranks among the most efficient variable cost models in our coverage group and has a very consistent operating model. The current freight environment is a risk factor for the company as sourcing shifts present mix and profitability headwinds via freight profile, lane density, and cost to serve. Expeditors has demonstrated resilience in this volatile environment, but we will continue to monitor the environment closely as near-term headwinds persist.

The airfreight segment has performed well in recent quarters, largely due to trade policy uncertainties driving a pull-forward of high value goods against a tight capacity backdrop. - · Volume. Since 2024, air freight tonnage has been increasing each quarter due to tightened capacity. In 2024, the company's tonnage growth was ~12% y/y and has kept upper-single digit growth in 2025 so far.

Ocean freight had a strong run from the Red Sea disruptions, but we expect the segment to face headwinds moving forward as demand will likely not keep pace with excess capacity in the market, absent further geopolitical shipping lane disruption. - · Volume. Ocean TEUs have remained strong due to pull-forward of volumes ahead of trade policy disruption. However, the latter half of 2025 has seen significantly less container volume growth and a meaningful contraction of spot rates from excess capacity. Last quarter's ocean revenues declined 27% y/y with TEU declines building through the quarter. We expect this trend to continue in 4Q25, followed by continued softness into 2026.

The customs segment has benefited from increased clearance activity and new business in warehousing, road freight, and distribution. As complexity rises from shifting trade rules and patterns, Expeditors has a long runway of opportunity from its compliance capabilities, in our view.

· Guidance versus Reported. Expeditors has been exceeding our and the Street's expectations for the last several quarters. Despite extreme volatility in its end markets, the company has remained relatively stable through its consistent operating model, flexible compensation structure, and execution. · Estimate Changes: We are expecting slightly tapering market conditions in the fourth quarter, bringing our 4Q25 EPS estimate to $1.39 versus the Street's $1.44. We are modeling FY25 EPS of $5.85 versus the Street consensus of $5.86, followed by a slight increase to $5.90 in FY26.

GXO has continued to grow through contract wins and acquisitions. Although growth has been pressured soft broader market demand, GXO's long term contracted business model has been stable compared to overall market volatility. While the business has less exposure to customer freight flows versus peers, it is not entirely immune to the sluggish demand and reluctance to outsource which has caused some doubt about management's initial long-term double digit organic revenue growth target. That said, the company's new business pipeline is starting to convert, with last quarter's organic growth reaching 5.6% y/y.

GXO has maintained positive organic revenue growth since 2023 as contract wins remain strong. Last quarter marked the highest y/y organic revenue growth in the last two years at 5.6%, driven by heightened activity from its omni-channel retail, electronics, and industrial and manufacturing customers.

· 1H25 New Business Wins of ~$500mm. GXO saw $307mm-a 13% y/y increase-of new business wins, primarily in the omni-channel retail and tech verticals, which brought the first half total to roughly half a billion dollars. The third quarter 2025 saw a 4% y/y rise in organic revenues, reflecting continued strong momentum. · $690mm incremental revenues secured for 2026 through 3Q. The company continues to secure a strong pipeline of revenues for 2026. Additionally, retention levels remain in the mid-90s, providing solid baseline stability. · Geographic Trends . The North American market saw the most volume growth so far this year from strong exposure to aerospace and technology infrastructure verticals, which have performed better than anticipated. In the UK, growth is stemming from healthcare customers, which is expected to continue in the second half. Management is confident in further sequential improvements in 4Q25 given momentum with site-level efficiencies and startups mature and move toward normalized margins.

GXO has been successful in conducting strategic acquisitions to grow the business, in our view. Most recently, the company has begun integrating Wincanton after regulatory approval last quarter. Management does not anticipate further M&A in the near term as they work to reduce leverage toward a 1.5x to 2x target. - · Wincanton . The company's acquisition of Wincanton continues to unlock growth opportunities in the industrial and aerospace markets across Europe. $60mm of synergies are expected by the end of 2026. Management expects the integration to contribute to top-line growth, with further efficiencies progressing into 2026 as technology and systems are integrated.

· Reaffirmed FY25 Guidance. Last quarter, management reaffirmed FY25 guidance of organic revenue growth between 3.5%-6.5%, adjusted EBITDA of $865mm-$885mm, adjusted EPS of $2.43-$2.63, and 25%-35% FCF conversion. Management expects its NHS contract and other new business to contribute incrementally in 4Q25, helping offset ongoing softness in freight demand. · Estimate Changes: We expect the 10-year NHS contract (~$2.5bn total value) which launched in October to contribute meaningfully to 4Q performance. Furthermore, management noted they expect to close another large healthcare win in 4Q25. We are modeling 4Q25 EPS of $0.82, relatively in line with the Street's $0.84. While we expect continued progress in 2026, we are taking down our estimates to reflect ongoing market softness and expected challenges throughout 2026.

Universal Logistics operates as a full-service logistics business across multiple industries. It's primary segment, contract logistics, has historically been a stable contributor to earnings, while its other segments, particularly intermodal, has consistently been a drag to the portfolio overall. The company is largely exposed to several sluggish end markets, which is expected to weigh on near-term performance. Moreover, the recent Parsec acquisition has been slow to realize synergies, in our view, and clouds valuation analysis given front-end-loaded depreciation and amortization costs.

Y/Y Change

The contract logistics segment is the largest revenue driver for Universal. Margins were inflated by a specialty contract in 2024, which has been sunsetted. Consequently, margins have returned closer to historical norms. - · Parsec integration . Last quarter, the Parsec acquisition added ~$55mm of revenues to the segment, but also added to the cost base, bringing down margins. While the company is still early in the integration, we are expecting synergies to materialize at a much slower pace than previously expected given weakness in end markets.

Intermodal has been a consistent drag on the overall portfolio, contributing negatively to EBIT each quarter while margins remain in the red zone. While losses have seemingly narrowed, we expect negative contribution for at least another year, especially as rates remain soft in the near term. Structurally, the segment is contending with an upside-down labor cost structure, which is primarily a function of California's AB5 regulatory employee classification change

The trucking segment has faced meaningful industrial headwinds in recent quarters. Specifically, its focus on heavy-haul and the wind business could be heavily impacted by the Trump Administration's policy aversion to renewable energy. The company is heavily exposed to industrial end markets, which have performed worse than consumer-oriented channels in recent years.

· Guidance versus Reported. Universal has a solid core contract logistics business, in our view, but the company is uniquely exposed to end markets that are underperforming due to weak industrial demand and policy changes surrounding renewable energy. Its intermodal business has consistently been a drag on the overall portfolio, further dampening performance. · Guidance & Outlook. Following significant under-performance last quarter, the company issued guidance for 4Q25 in which they expect operating revenues between $365mm-$385mm and EBITDA margins between 12% and 14%. Furthermore, operating margins are expected to fall between 4% and 6%. · Estimate Changes: Given the company's lower earnings in 3Q25 and expected continued softness in 4Q25, we had already tempered our 2025 and 2026 estimates to reflect slower growth. Our 4Q25 EPS estimate of ($0.05) brings our FY25 estimate to ($0.04) and we expect FY26 EPS to be $0.92.

(1) 1Q11 excludes a $5.9mm SG&A charge associated with an adverse ruling by the Illinois Court of Appeals (2) 4Q12 excludes non-recurring personnel expenses of $0.385mm and SG&A expenses of $8.736mm associated with the acquisitions of Phoenix and Apreo, as well as personnel expenses of $34.207mm and SG&A expenses of $0.379mm associated with the divestiture of T-Chek (3) 4Q12 and FY2012 share count reflects shares of C.H. Robinson stock issued as consideration paid to the sellers in the acquisition of Phoenix, as well as the additional vesting of performance-based restricted stock as a result of the gain on sale recognized from the divestiture of T-Chek (4) 2Q13 excludes $5.0mm charge related to the settlement of a contingent auto liability claim; the $5.0mm represents the amount of retained risk under the terms of C.H. Robinson's contingent auto liability insurance policy

(5) 4Q15 excludes the impact of an indemnification asset write off of $7.2mm related to the acquisition of Phoenix as the indemnification obligations of the sellers expired; that amount was partially offset by the expiration of related tax liabilities (6) 4Q17 excludes a $19.7mm benefit resulting from deductions under IRC §199, as well as $12.1mm due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which was signed into law on 12/22/17, and primarily the result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the decrease in the corporate Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, partially offset by the impact of certain transition taxes and other tax reform Source: Company data and Stifel estimates J.
