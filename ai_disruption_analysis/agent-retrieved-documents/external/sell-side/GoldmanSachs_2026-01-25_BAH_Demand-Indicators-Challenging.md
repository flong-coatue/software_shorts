BAH 12m Pri c e Target: $80.00 Pri c e: $102.23

BAH revenue declined 10% organically in the quarter, and the company revised FY26 revenue and free cash guidance lower, narrowed the EBITDA range, and raised EPS on a lower tax rate. Leading indicators suggest forward top-line growth may be slow to recover. In the quarter, headcount was down 12% yoy and 3% sequentially, and funded book-to-bill was 0.53X, while contracting activity at the US government remains choppy for Fed Civ and certain DoD verticals. Booz Allen federal spending obligations suggest a further move lower in revenue. We think the leading indicators suggest more downside risk to forward revenue, while revisions to government contracting terms create risk to margins. Historically, government spending priority shifts can be multiple years in duration. We remain Sell rated on the stock.

Revenue of $2.62bn was 5% below FactSet consensus, and adjusted EBITDA of $285mn was 1% above, re fl ecting a 10.9% margin (down 50bps yoy) versus consensus at 10.3%. Revenue was down 10% yoy. Adjusted EPS of $1.77 was above consensus of $1.29, with tax favorable by approximately 50c. Company reported book to bill in the quarter was 0.3X (1.1X LTM). Funded book-to-bill was 0.53X (0.96X TTM). Cash from ops was $261mn, above consensus at $241mn. Headcount was down 12% yoy and down 3% sequentially. BAH revised FY26 guidance including revenue of $11.3-$11.4bn ($11.3-$11.5bn prior, consensus at $11.4bn), adjusted EBITDA of $1.195-$1.215bn ($1.190-$1.220bn prior, consensus at $1.21bn), FCF of $825-900mn ($850-950mn prior, consensus at $906mn) and EPS of

$5.95-$6.15 ($5.45-$5.65 prior, consensus at $5.62). The revenue range implies a (5)-(6)% sales decline.

Our 12-month price target of $80 (from $77 prior), is derived from a target 11.3X (from 2aeb9e8b174644998c7303f5a989d953 10.8X prior to re fl ect a mark-to-market multiple and revised estimates) Q5-Q8 estimated EV/EBITDA. We revise our FY26-FY29E EBITDA to $1,202/$1,146/$1,142/$1,167mn from $1,198/$1,147/$1,145/$1,159mn to re fl ect updated revenue and margin estimates.

Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.
