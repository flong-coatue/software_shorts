2026 Outlook: AI Apps and Agents Take Center Stage. Our 110-page 2026 Internet Outlook report lays the foundation for our expectations for the Internet in 2026. We lay out 10 key predictions and a bonus prediction across the space, many of which focus on continued investment in and the proliferation of AI, as we expect agents and AI applications to scale meaningfully in 2026E. BMO 2026 Internet Outlook Top Picks: GOOGL , AMZN , TTWO and DKNG.

1) Agent Race Will Narrow in 2026E with the Deployment and Validation of Agents. We believe that success will be measured by which companies can most effectively translate their models into verifiable real-world value for enterprises and consumers. 2) The AI Application Layer Begins to Scale Meaningfully , leading to increased adoption of AI tools by consumers and enterprises. The Big Question: How will agentic AI applications impact various subsectors? 3) The CapEx Super-Cycle Will Continue in 2026E with Signs of Further Growth into 2027E as leading cloud providers like AMZN and GOOGL (and non-cloud META) continue to ramp CapEx spend to go after the AI opportunity.

4) Advancements in AI Move it from the Digital to the Physical with Robotics. Companies' integration of robotics has been underway for decades, and AI is expanding the physical productivity frontier by providing the intelligence that powers robotics. We anticipate AI operating as the brain will drive a step-function increase in robotic and physical AI capabilities (such as smart glasses) in 2026E and beyond. 5) AV Industry Transitions from Proof-of-Concept to Business Model Validation, with success hinging on achieving operational efficiency, sustainable unit economics, and high utilization rates, while maintaining safety standards. 6) AMZN Makes a Meaningful Acquisition Around its AI Ambitions , making a $1B+ acquisition in the space. AMZN has only made six $1B+ acquisitions in its history, and we believe a sizable AI acquisition would help close the perceived gap in its AI capabilities.

7) Content Creators Continue to Create, Driving Engagement and Advertising Revenue as both YouTube and Meta launched tools for Creators to better monetize their content in late 2025, which sets up for a strong 2026E. 8) Age Verification Proliferates Across The Internet, Impacting Social, Gaming, and AI Businesses, presenting a headwind to growth. While age verification will support online safety, it is likely to affect time spent online and monetization. 9) UGC Game Development Levels Up as Competitors Ramp Investments in an Attempt to Catch Up to RBLX . Expect TTWO to dive into the UGC opportunity ahead of the release of GTA VI . 10) Travel Growth Resets Higher as Gen Z Leans into Experiences and Agents Begin to Take Over . We believe that online travel will remain one of the biggest beneficiaries of new AI capabilities as agentic AI becomes the latest OS in travel. BONUS: Affordability Remains in Focus for Retail as the macro picture softens and a K-shaped consumption pattern settles in.

· Cracks in the low-income consumer · Supply chain disruptions around the AI infrastructure build-out (energy?) · Failure of businesses in scaling AI applications to enterprises/consumers · Tariffs and inflationary pressures · Geopolitical pressures, specifically between the U.S. and China Our Top Picks for 2026E: GOOGL, AMZN, TTWO and DKNG

It has been three years since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, marking the era of AI that continues to dominate the tech landscape. While the AI leaders continue to push progress forward, the current implementation of AI remains uneven. According to a McKinsey survey , 9 out of 10 organizations are regularly using AI but are still in a pilot phase. Ultimately, the current gap between extensive piloting and full deployment signals a significant untapped opportunity for businesses to deepen AI integration and engagement. However, on the consumer side, more than half of American adults (61%) have used AI in the past six months, and nearly one in five rely on it every day ( Menlo Ventures ), with plenty of opportunity to capitalize on growing familiarity.

The rapid advancement and adoption of LLMs have now laid the necessary foundation for agentic AI, with the competitive race kicking off with Anthropic's Computer Use preview in October 2024 . Despite Anthropic being first out of the gate, the field remains wide open as agents from various providers continue to penetrate both consumer and enterprise markets. AI Agents are quickly becoming the 'next big thing.' By 2028E, Gartner predicts that 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, with at least 15% of day-today work decisions being made autonomously through AI agents. As agent competition narrows, we believe that 2026E will become a crucial year for deployment and validation, in which agent success will be measured by which companies can most effectively translate their models into verifiable, real-world value.

Before we get into agents, it is essential to differentiate between agentic AI and AI agents (or agents), which both get used interchangeably but are not the same. Essentially, agentic AI is a system across multiple domains, while an AI agent works independently. · Agentic AI : A system that orchestrates multiple AI agents that are goal-driven and deliver on tasks independently with limited supervision. The system can manage numerous agents and agent workflows (IBM). · Agents: A specific component within agentic systems that is designed to handle tasks and processes with a degree of autonomy. Often powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) or Specialized Language Models (SLMs) for specific tasks. The agent operates alone on a task and treats each task in isolation (IBM). Exhibit 1 - Gartner's Emerging AI Agent Landscape Source: Gartner

The agent race is complex, and winning will require creating ecosystems, platforms, infrastructure, and solutions that span the AI value chain. The stakes in agents are significant, with a predicted total spending of $512 billion between 2025E and 2029E, with cumulative AI-related technology spend expected to be $3.3 trillion (Exhibit 5). We continue to believe the AI evolution, particularly with the rise of agentic AI, is unprecedented, given that consumers and enterprises can take advantage of it through the internet, which is accessible to 5.5B people via mobile devices, thereby enabling global mass adoption and usage of agentic technology. Agentic Opportunity is Still Early... For Enterprises and Consumers. Though generative AI (Gen AI) has captured headlines with its meteoric rise to popularity, AI agents are quickly becoming the 'next big thing.' By 2028, Gartner predicts that 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, with at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions being made autonomously through AI agents.

According to McKinsey, 23% of respondents report that their organizations are scaling an agentic AI system within their enterprises (that is, expanding the deployment and adoption of the technology across at least one business function), and an additional 39% say they have begun experimenting with AI agents. Most companies reported scaling agents in one or two functions. In any given business function, no more than 10% of respondents say their organizations are scaling AI agents (Exhibit 3), indicating that the agentic opportunity remains early, with substantial runwayahead, as every business function expects to experiment with agents next year. However, deployment may take time as enterprises prepare their technology stack and infrastructure. Deployment will likely experience many hurdles, but companies focusing on agentic AI efforts to develop workflows are more likely to deliver a positive outcome, given the amount of support needed.

Consumers Agents Likely to be Driven by Scale. In consumer, we anticipate adoption will be faster than enterprises given LLM's agents partnerships across shopping, travel, and events, and WAU for ChatGPT of 900M and Gemini App MAUs of 650M. The initial adoption ramp will likely resemble the adoption of LLMs, with large step-ups in users following technology upgrades and releases (Exhibit 4).

We remain bullish on Agents given their ability to integrate across multiple platforms and penetrate almost every industry. We currently view Google, Amazon, Anthropic, and OpenAI as the most likely leaders in agents, given their offerings for both consumers and enterprises, as well as in platform frameworks and APIs. Among the current agent frontrunners, GOOGL and AMZN stand out given their full-stack offerings and consumer and enterprise agent products. Recently, Anthropic outperformed rivals on almost every agent benchmark with its latest model release (Exhibit 6, 7, 8). OpenAI continues to post strong model scores but holds a unique advantage through its consumer adoption of ChatGPT, which offers a powerful scaling mechanism. What remains to be seen is how LLMs will continue to capture value and support revenue growth, given that AI is capital-intensive. Notably, OpenAI, which has invested billions to improve ChatGPT, has only 5% of its 900M WAU users paying for the service.

As AI continues to become more of a commodity, we believe that the only options are to win the agent race by 1) controlling the entire AI stack from custom silicon to foundational models to hardware devices, and/or 2) mass scale through consumer products .

Based on the above, we believe Google is in the best position given its: 1. Full-stack approach with TPUs, LLM, and Android devices, and 2. Leadership position in consumer search. We believe its existing relationship and touchpoints with enterprises and consumers position it better than rivals to integrate agents directly into its apps/infrastructure, allowing consumers to benefit from agents in the applications they already use. Google's Agentic Consumer Offering to Scale from Search and the Broader Google Ecosystem. In 2025, Google released and integrated various agentic features into Chrome, Gemini, and AI Mode, and, given the massive reach of Chrome's 73.2% market share , Gemini's 650 million MAUs, and 2 billion monthly AI Mode users, we expect agentic adoption to ramp significantly in 2026E.

Similar to OpenAI and Anthropic, access to Gemini's agentic capabilities in AI Mode and the Gemini app requires a subscription. However, unlike the two LLM providers, Google is best positioned to monetize its AI and agents, given its current advertising infrastructure and its ability to incorporate sponsored listings across its ecosystem. Agent Products:

· Web Browsing: Gemini can work across multiple tabs and browse live web pages in the background to gather information across multiple sites, compare options, and even help users complete bookings. · Applications in Travel and Shopping: ○ Google users in the US will now have access to several new AI shopping features through AI Mode and the Gemini App. The new features include targeting tasks such as searching for products, comparing similar items, tracking prices, and agent checkout. Users can click into items, visit retailer sites, see historic pricing data, and track price changes, all from AI Mode. AI Mode will track prices over time and notify users via text or email when a product price drops. ○ Google announced it is rolling out agentic booking for restaurants on AI Mode in the U.S. (no Labs opt-in required), with plans to add agentic booking for flights and hotels directly in AI Mode.

· Assistant Across the Google Ecosystem: Gemini Agent can leverage connected apps across the Google ecosystem, such as Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Keep, Tasks, Google Maps, and YouTube. For example, Gemini can manage users' inboxes by asking Gemini to create tasks, archive emails, and even draft a response for you to review, edit, and send. · Agents on Android?: Google has been fortifying its Android devices with Gemini, turning them into an AI advisor. We wouldn't be surprised to see Android become deeply embedded with agentic capabilities in the future. · Gemini Coming to Google Home : The smart home ecosystem (Nest, Doorbell Home Speaker) is powered by Gemini, making it a more intelligent AI assistant. Similar to Android, we anticipate the company will integrate agentic capabilities at some point. We believe the opportunity for consumer home agents is significant, and believe GOOGL is well-positioned to gain market share over time, given the massive amount of data from Android devices and Smart Homes.

its agentic and AI offering. Particularly attractive are its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which we consistently hear from technology industry insiders are the best alternative to NVDA's CUDA-based GPUs. Notably, more than 70% of GCP customers use Google's AI, and 13 million developers have built with its Gemini models. This provides Google an advantage over OpenAI and Anthropic, which can only offer models. Back in October, the company launched Gemini Enterprise, an advanced agentic platform that provides companies with toolkits to build AI assistants and agents. AI agents can access, combine, and analyze information from internal systems and Google AI tools like Code Assist and Deep Research within a single enterprise workflow. In terms of pricing, Gemini Enterprise standard and 'plus' editions start at $30 per seat per month. A cheaper Gemini Business annual plan, intended for small businesses, startups, or individual departments within a larger company, costs $21 per seat per month.

Since its launch, the company has gained 2 million subscribers across 700 companies, assuming a 50/50 split would add $600 million in annual revenue. Exhibit 10 - Examples of Select Google Agentic Platforms, Programs, and Tools

Amazon's position in the agent race remains competitive given its potential for an agentic consumer offering on Amazon.com, and an enterprise offering with Bedrock and AgentCore. AWS continues to offer the best-in-class full-stack Cloud solution for both start-ups and large enterprises. Ramping up integrations of AI agents for both consumer and business use cases is a near-term tailwind for usage, especially with recent agent/agentic announcements at AWS Re:Invent ( see our note here ). Furthermore, AI agents are revolutionizing customer experiences, presenting a new growth opportunity due to incremental inference workloads. Amazon's AI shopper assistant Rufus is already making a significant impact. While Rufus is an assistant rather than an agent, the tool's performance has been impressive, as CEO Andrew Jassy noted on the company's 3Q25 call: '[Rufus] is on track to deliver over $10 billion in incremental annualized sales'.

Rufus gained 250 million active customers in 2025, and those who used the chatbot were 60% more likely to complete a purchase. Given Amazon's backing and partnership with Anthropic, we would not be surprised if Rufus receives agentic features supported by Claude. Notably, during Black Friday, Amazon reported a 75% daily increase in Rufus-assisted sessions that resulted in purchases, compared to just 35% for non-Rufus sessions. The gap between AI-assisted and non-assisted confirms a broader trend that consumers are increasingly using AI to guide shopping decisions. We believe that some agentic adoption by users is highly likely, given Amazon's scale and reach as the number one e-commerce website in the U.S., its positioning as the eighth most-visited website globally, and, over the last 2 years, its ability to drive an average of 2.71M monthly users (SimilarWeb).

'...Less than 20% of workloads at this point have moved to the cloud...I think it's [Agentic is] an enormous potential for many of our customers and if you think about all of the value that we've already seen from generative AI today, from generating of content to summarizations to things like that, I think that led to 10%, 20%, 30% efficiency gains and benefits for customers. I think the promise of agentic is when these models can go and actually accomplish tasks for you and long-running tasks where they can go do stuff, where they can use tools, they can use browsers, they can use capabilities out there, they can use text editors, et cetera. That's when you start to see not 20% gains but 200% gains."

Source: Amazon Alexa+ with Anthropic Lays the Foundation for AI Personal Assistants and Agents. Alexa+ intelligence is powered by both Amazon's Nova Models and Anthropic's Claude, significantly improving its capabilities over the previous version. Like Google Home, Alexa+ has been a massive boon for users, with agentic-like properties that can use natural-language requests to do nearly anything around the house. We believe the opportunity for consumer AI is significant, and believe AMZN is well-positioned to have a share of the market over time with Alexa+ and Rufus, the AI personal shopper. However, we believe AMZN's opportunity in enterprise AI is likely stronger, given their strengths in AWS and Amazon Bedrock.

Bedrock's AgentCore Wide Offering of LLMs Remains Attractive. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is an agentic platform for building, deploying, and operating highly effective agents securely at scale using any framework and houses 17 of the leading LLMs on the platform, as well as its own Nova Series. We view the platforms' agnostic offering as vital, and we firmly believe there will be multiple winners in the foundational model space in the long term. Bedrock is cementing itself as the agnostic AI platform for enterprises to build AI applications on. Amazon's AWS: All in on Agents at re:Invent 2025. At this year's re:Invent 2025 ( See more details and breakdown of products in our note here ), AWS announced several new agents that will help redefine the software development and utilization process. These agents (discussed in exhibit 12) can work for hours (and even days) on specific tasks without human intervention, ultimately producing a tangible output that meets the initial request.

Amazon has positioned AgentCore as a one-stop shop for agent building, given the wide variety and capabilities of its offering. While we are unable to confirm the effectiveness of these agents, we believe this is the future of software development, deployment, and monitoring. Additional Agent Products Announced at re:Invent 2025 · Frontier Agents: A new class of agents driving a step-function change in capabilities. These agents are autonomous and massively scalable; once given a goal, they will go out and achieve the desired output without human intervention. The agents are also long-running and may work for days to achieve their goals without human intervention. These agents will run alongside your workflow to automate development tasks. A user assigns a task, and the Kiro Autonomous Agent will work to complete it. All of this work will take place in the background, allowing the 2025

engineering team to remain focused on the bigger picture. We believe the roll-out of these agents (and competing agents from other platforms) will drive a step-function change in software development. · AWS Security Agent: Allows users to build secure apps from design to deployment. It embeds security upstream and proactively secures applications throughout the development lifecycle. The agent will also scan code for potential vulnerabilities, helping you to ensure your code is secure before entering and while in production.

OpenAI's biggest advantage in the agentic race is its 900 million WAU on ChatGPT which the company has integrated with agentic features. However, as noted previously, only 5% of those users pay for a subscription tier that gives access to the agentic features. OpenAI is heavily focused on expanding its enterprise offering with its API access and premium subscriptions for ChatGPT Enterprise which has over a million organizations subscribed and 7 million workplace seats. Over the last year the company has aggressively expanded its enterprise agents offering, with Agentic Commerce Protocol (co-developed with Stripe) and the Agent Kit to help developers build and deploy agents, directly competing with the major hyperscalers.

Unlike the hyperscalers, OpenAI lacks cloud infrastructure and hardware but has announced many deals and partnerships to own the full AI stack including: moving into hardware with the acquisition of io (acquired for $6.5 billion), building out data centers with Oracle and Softbank, and working with Broadcom to design its own chips. We view the deals as OpenAI trying to own a full-stack ecosystem to rival hyperscalers and control the entire lifecycle of its models and agents. However, many of the recent deals OpenAI has struck to build out its technology platform with chipmakers, cloud computing companies, and others are worryingly circular. Fueling market concerns that the company's technological progress may stall.

Integration of Agent Capabilities into ChatGPT. As mentioned above, OpenAI's most significant advantage is its impressive consumer reach with its 900M WAUs of ChatGPT; however, only 5% pay. With its latest models, OpenAI is incorporating agentic features into ChatGPT and has launched Atlas, a web browser with agentic capabilities from Agent Mode for Plus, Pro, and business subscribers. The launch marks a step toward a future where the web could become increasingly through agentic systems. We will continue to watch whether the company's incorporated agentic features will ultimately drive the conversion of free users to paying users. Agent Products:

· Agent Mode through ChatGPT: More advanced than Operator (see below) as it is the primary user interface that leverages agentic models like GPT-5/GPT-5.1. Users can interact with it via text or voice to perform tasks, generate content, and access specialized tools such as web search and code interpretation. · Operator: A research preview agent capable of automating tasks online by using its own browser to navigate and interact with websites (typing, clicking, scrolling). Less advanced and less capable than Agent Mode. · Deep Research: An AI agent that performs extensive web browsing, data analysis, and synthesis to deliver comprehensive reports. · Atlas: Web browser (available only on Mac iOS) where users can turn on 'agent mode' that can fill up online shopping baskets, plan trips, and book appointments. It can also search across multiple tabs in the background.

· Hardware: OpenAI acquired former Apple designer Johnny Ives's io for $6.5 billion with plans to build an AI device. The device will likely serve as a gateway for users to interact with AI agents. However, the device has faced technological delays and has been pushed back from a 2026E release to 2027E. Strong Enterprise Offering. OpenAI has primarily targeted gains in consumer share, with the company only launching its enterprise offering in 2023, since expanding to include various agentic tools and protocols. We suspect that, given the lack of paying consumers, the majority of the company's revenue is generated from businesses. The company's enterprise offering has over 1 million customers and more than 7 million total ChatGPT for Work seats. As the company lacks the infrastructure to support its services, we continue to believe that leading hyperscalers like Amazon and Google are well-positioned to benefit from OpenAI's buildout, as we expect this will create a new digital economy that runs on top of AWS/GCP and other cloud services. Agent Products:

· Agentic Commerce Protocol: An open standard for AI commerce that lets AI agents and businesses complete purchases. The protocol was co-developed with Stripe and other merchants to enable secure, easy adoption. · Agent Kit: The new toolkit will help developers build and deploy AI agents faster and better optimize agent workflows. The product will directly compete with Microsoft, Amazon, Anthropic, and Google's offering of agentic tools, as the company looks to bring more developers inside the OpenAI ecosystem. We note that Amazon and Google both announced new competing AI enterprise offerings this week (see below for more). · Codex: A cloud-based software engineering agent that can work on many tasks in parallel, powered by Codex-1. Codex can perform agentic tasks such as writing features, answering questions about a user's codebase, fixing bugs, and proposing pull requests for review.

The company was first out of the gate, releasing an agent in October 2024 with its preview of Computer Use. Despite being first out of the gate, the company has been slower to launch its GTM products than the competition. However, this is likely due to the company's emphasis on safety and product quality, which has resulted in 1) delivering models on time, and 2) producing some of the best models to date . Despite having less capital and resources than OpenAI and Google, Anthropic has not only kept up with various intelligence benchmarks, but its Claude models have also surpassed its competitors on agentic benchmarks (Exhibit 17). Anthropic's business strategy has primarily focused on enterprise customers, whom we view as stickier, less prone to churn, and with deeper spending than consumers. This strategy has played out very well for the company, with the largest share of enterprise usage and coding (Exhibits 18 and 19), resulting in the company raising its optimistic revenue projections (Exhibit 15).

t2-bench scored with Anthropic's Sonnet 4.5 Source: BMO Capital Markets, Google, Scale.AI Consumer Adoption Slower but Could See Scale from Partnerships. As mentioned above, Anthropic's business strategy remains focused on enterprise rather than consumers. The company has released consumer products but has been slower to do so, given its strategy, and has limited roll-outs, given its emphasis on product safety and quality. This has meant the company has given up share in the consumer market to its competitors; however, given the company continues to deliver on models often better than the competition, we think over time it is likely to recover some lost ground. Unlike OpenAI and Google, Anthropic does not disclose any metrics on its Claude consumer product. Its consumer subscription pricing is noticeably lower than Google's and OpenAI's, which could help it gain share (Exhibit 20).

· Claude AI in Chrome: The browser-based AI agent launched in September and is now available to all subscribers of its Max plan. The Chrome extension allows users to chat with Claude in a sidebar window and permits Claude to take actions in the browser for select tasks. The extension also integrates with Gmail and Google Calendar, as Gemini does. · Updates to Opus 4.5: The newly released model is better at performing complex multistep tasks on a user's computer and over the internet, which should further support the use of the Claude AI Chrome extension. Anthropic is Strategically Positioned to Dominate the Enterprise AI Sector. We think the company's consistent ability to produce agentic models and tools will continue to drive demand among enterprises. In July, Anthropic surpassed OpenAI in terms of LLM enterprise API market share by usage (Exhibit 18) and has a significant lead in the AI coding market share (Exhibit 19).

Anthropic's strong product offering and model intelligence are driving share gains and have led to a partnership with Microsoft, in which the company announced that Anthropic's LLMs would power more complex tasks in its Copilot suite, supplanting OpenAI, given Anthropic's stronger, more powerful models . While Anthropic doesn't have a full-stack offering or a strong consumer offering, we think its ability to scale across enterprises will continue to generate consistent revenue, especially given its model's leadership in agentic capabilities.

Agent Products: · Claude Developer Platform: The platform allows users to integrate the company's advanced AI models, Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, into applications via an API, supporting code generation with Claude Code, AI agents, and customer support chatbots, with options for self-serve deployment or custom enterprise solutions. Recent updates include new tools for longer-running agents, an effort parameter for balancing time and capability, and improved context management for multiagent systems. · Claude Code: Agentic coding tool that integrates directly into a user's terminal or IDE, allowing it to understand the codebase and perform various tasks using natural language commands. It can build features from descriptions, debug and fix issues, navigate codebases, automate tasks such as listing fixes and release notes, refactor code, and manage Git workflows, including commits and GitHub pushes.

· MCP: An open-sourced standard for connecting AI assistants and agents across content repositories, business tools, and development environments. Ultimately, MCP replaces a fragmented system and prevents data silos, allowing agents to better communicate with one another, improving the quality of AI through data sharing, and simplifying integration.

While agent adoption from consumers and enterprises has already begun, a potential slowdown could be caused by any one of the following: · Infrastructure (physical and digital): For agents to scale, it will require immense computational power for training and inference, chips, cloud computing capacity, electrical power and cooling, and network connectivity. Any slowdown forces an immediate slowdown or retraction of agent use. · Technology: If technological innovations do not continue to advance and agent growth flatlines, particularly among consumers given limited use, it could retract. · Consumers getting comfortable with the product: Future adoption hinges on whether endusers, both consumers and enterprises, find the agents trustworthy, helpful, and easy to use. · Security Risks: Agents process sensitive data; any data leaks or agents acting outside of controls could trigger a complete shutdown of agent activity.

development. We believe 2026 will mark the start of a meaningful ramp in AI applications as developers look to build on leading AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers. We believe investors will look back on the evolution of the AI wave and define 2023-2025 as the modeldevelopment era, and view 2026 as the start of the shift into the application layer. Model Development is Not Going Away. To clarify our views, we anticipate that leading model providers will continue to meaningfully invest in model development, which remains a source of significant innovation, as they look to build more intelligent, more capable models that will further enhance the application build-out. We highlight that Google recently topped the charts with the launch of Gemini 3 , which we discussed in depth in our note here, underscoring that innovations in the model layer continue to occur. However, as these models have become increasingly more capable over the last couple of years, we believe the ability for companies to build applications on top of leading foundation models at scale has arrived.

Importantly, we highlight that GOOGL's existing application layer, including Google Maps, Gmail, Google Search, YouTube, and other applications, provides Google with scalable platforms for integrating AI directly. As a result, we believe Google has a massive competitive advantage in scaling its AI applications, given its ability to acquire customers for its AI products at a meaningfully lower customer acquisition cost (CAC) by plugging AI directly into existing products. Furthermore, while they have an existing scale advantage, they also offer best-in-class AI technology, which makes their AI integrations even more valuable. Exhibit 23 - Understanding the AI Tech Stack Source: LeewayHertz Cloud Providers are Clear Beneficiaries of a Scaled Application Layer. Importantly, we believe the hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, and GCP) are well-positioned to be winners as the AI application layer unfolds. Importantly, as AI applications scale, the use of these applications will require inference to be generated in datacenters, ultimately leading to increased spending by these application companies on cloud services that support inference.

This is very similar to the application layer that emerged with the creation of the internet, in which applications like DDOG, SNOW, and TEAM that run on top of the cloud pay cloud companies to host their applications in the cloud (which largely shows up in their respective COGS). As a result, the cloud market is a clear beneficiary as AI apps scale. Additionally, we believe cloud vendors like AWS, GCP, and Azure may even compete directly with their own applications, as they do in the cloud, where they offer applications that sometimes compete with companies that run on top of them. We believe these cloud companies will identify specific AI applications to scale, allowing them to benefit directly from the rise of their own AI applications. However, we note that the success of their own applications can be somewhat cannibalistic, as they will then compete with the same customers who offer competing apps.

Nonetheless, we see the hyperscalers as one of the best ways to play the AI application opportunity, allowing investors to avoid betting on riskier AI application startups that could fail to scale an AI application with lasting impact over the long term.

CapEx Super-Cycle to Continue: Leading cloud companies (and META) are set to increase CapEx again in 2026E as they build out the critical infrastructure needed to pursue the AI opportunity. We expect AMZN to continue to lead the way, with $163B in 2026E CapEx, followed by GOOGL at $138B, MSFT at $106B, and META at $104B. Additionally, we believe CapEx spend is set to grow again in 2027E as big tech continues to invest in infrastructure to support the long-term opportunity. We highlight that recent commentary from management suggests there is no slowdown in sight on CapEx spending (more on this later in our outlook). Exhibit 24 - Annual Calendar Year Capex Spend (in $B) Estimates are BMOe, except MSFT which is consensus Source: Company data, Visible Alpha, BMO Capital Markets

CapEx Growth to Decelerate YoY in 2026E, But CapEx Growth to Remain Robust. We expect cumulative CapEx spend by AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and META to accelerate to 59% growth (vs. 56% in 2024) and reach $366B for 2025E. In 2026, we expect CapEx across mega-cap tech to grow 40% YoY, reaching $510B. We expect this growth to meaningfully decelerate to 11% in 2027E, as the mega-cap tech investment cycle peaks. Our Cloud Experts Expect Ramping CapEx In 2026E: We highlight our recent pre-3Q25 earnings cloud checks with a cloud expert who has $4.7B into annual cloud spend, said they anticipate hyperscaler CapEx to continue to ramp through at least mid-2026 , given that new NVDA Rubin next-gen GPUs could support a longer ramp during the CapEx super-cycle.

Exhibit 25 - Cummulative CapEx of AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT and META with YoY Growth chart shows the combined CY CapEx for AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT and META Source: Company data, Visible Alpha, BMO Capital Markets Despite Massive CapEx Ramp, Mega-Cap Tech Will Continue to Be FCF Positive: Given the $500B that mega-cap tech players AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and META will be spending in 2026E, we believe it is important to note that these companies will continue to generate positive FCF even as they meaningfully ramp investments behind the AI opportunity. For perspective, after subtracting spend for capital expenditure in 2025E, consensus estimates suggest AMZN, GOOGL, and META will each generate $13B, $65B, and $45B in Free Cash Flow, respectively.

In 2026E, consensus implies that META's FCF falls to $23B, as both AMZN and GOOGL increase to $39B/ $70B, respectively, underscoring the ability for mega-cap tech vendors to leverage the cash they generate from their existing operations to fund their investment initiatives rather than needing to raise capital to invest in the business. With that said, we note that these leading hyperscalers have all recently raised several billion dollars each in new debt.

Intention of Slowing Down: Despite meaningful push-back from investors around the current CapEx super-cycle and the potential ROI from the spend, we don't believe these spenders (AMZN, GOOGL, META, and MSFT) have any intention of slowing down their spend. Importantly, we believe these companies believe they are in the middle of the largest investment cycle of our lifetimes, with a transformative outcome they think will rival the creation of the Internet and the economic opportunity that resulted. Because of this, we believe these companies will continue to spend as much as they can, especially given that every dollar they do not spend will be spent by their competitors, which would ultimately leave them even further behind in the race. Ultimately, we would not be surprised if these companies end up over-building their infrastructure buildouts when we look back; however, we believe the risk of overbuilding is not nearly as significant as the risk of underbuilding, as companies will eventually be able to grow into the capacity over time.

For perspective, many tech industry leaders are discussing building data centers in space , underscoring the expected scale of this infrastructure build-out to support future AI workloads. This is very reminiscent of the COVID-driven fulfillment build-out that AMZN undertook to grow its eCommerce fulfillment capabilities to support the ramping eCommerce demand during the pandemic. While AMZN ended up building more capacity than they needed at the time, these investments helped secure AMZN's moat in eCommerce, with excess fulfillment capacity that they eventually grew into over the ensuing years. Return on Said CapEx Spending Remains The Largest Debate: While we find it difficult to debate whether the CapEx Supercycle will continue into 2026E (given recent management commentary), we believe the most significant debate centers on the actual return on CapEx spending.

While we believe it is hard to define the actual ROI, we think that hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, and GCP have clear monetization opportunities on their spend, as CapEx spend behind cloud infrastructure is essentially immediately rented out as part of the cloud business to companies that need to access compute for AI workloads and model training. While we believe this ROI opportunity is clear, it is less clear for ad platforms like META, which have been seeking AI investments to drive AI-related improvements in ad spend on their platforms. Ultimately, we suspect the debate around the true ROI on the current CapEx cycle will continue. Still, we don't believe we will have an accurate estimate until the application layer of the AI build-out begins to scale meaningfully, which we think will support material value creation across the entire AI stack.

While companies' integration of robotics has been underway for decades, AI is expanding the physical productivity frontier by providing the intelligence that powers robotics and smart consumer technology, including smart glasses. Often referred to as "physical AI", the AI enables the hardware to autonomously perceive, reason, and adapt to unstructured, dynamic real-world environments. We believe that deeper penetration of physical AI will have knock-on effects for consumers and enterprises as advancements in LLMs could help unlock $2.9 trillion of economic value in the United States by 2030E ( McKinsey ). This will be especially true if enterprises can successfully prepare their employees and redesign workflows to accommodate people, agents, smart technologies, and robots working together. McKinsey further estimates that, in theory, robotics technologies could automate activities that account for 57% of US work hours today.

The robotics industry is a rapidly growing investment theme, with experts projecting a compound annual growth rate of 13% to 16%. In 2Q25 alone, robotics investments totaled at least $8.8 billion across 222 global deals, with the United States and China dominating. Recently, reinvestment in robotics has re-emerged with 1) increased acquisitions activity as seen by Amazon and Google, and 2) more cash allocated to CapEx and opex. The opportunity remains early, but given advancements in AI, we anticipate that robot and robotics investments should drive consumer and enterprise breakthroughs in 2026E and beyond. Amazon and Google maintain a significant lead in the robotics sector, given their ability to leverage massive capital, an established presence of robots in the market, and a powerful data flywheel that continuously fuels AI-driven improvements in robotics.

Nevertheless, OpenAI and Anthropic are rapidly entering the field, with OpenAI's aggressive hiring of robotics engineers and Anthropic's Project Fetch . This experiment measured the "AI uplift" provided by the Claude model during the training of a robot dog. In terms of physical AI in consumer devices, Meta, Google, and Amazon are all working on developing smart glasses that are integrated with AI. However, the opportunity remains early, as both hardware and software advancements are needed to achieve mass adoption. Advancements in Robotics could unlock $2.9 trillion of economic value in the United States by 2030E per a McKinsey report. Like many technological waves, adoption depends on implementation, expense, piloting time, and deployment. Case in point, cloud adoption is only 20% (as of 2023) despite the technology being widely available since the mid-2000s.

While we are bullish on the technology into 2026E, there is a higher risk of slower deployment given reliance on AI advancements and potential slowdowns in manufacturing. Exhibit 29 - AI has Fueled Robotics VC Deal Activity and Investment ($ in B) Source: BMO Capital Markets, PitchBook

Amazon plans to use more robots than humans in its warehouse. Notably 75% of Amazon's global deliveries are assisted in some way by robotics. Amazon spends enormous sums on automating human effort to enhance productivity and lower labor costs. We expect AMZN 2026E CapEx of $163B to continue supporting its AI and robotics ambitions. The automation of Amazon's facilities and warehouses is approaching a new milestone: soon, there will be as many robots as humans. Amazon's automation team expects the company to avoid hiring more than 160,000 people in the U.S. by 2027. We estimate that it would save roughly $0.30 per item that Amazon picks, packs, and delivers to customers. Notably, the company has deployed more than 1 million robots across its workplaces (per 3Q25 call), with the number of robots approaching its 1.56 million employees (2024).

In 2024, the company opened a three-million-square-foot warehouse in Louisiana that used automation and artificial intelligence at every step of the fulfillment process. Amazon is using three different automated robotic arms at its new building, including its Sparrow device, which uses suction cups and artificial intelligence software to identify objects by characteristics such as color, shape, and size. Given Amazon's AI capabilities, combined with the use of robotics across the fulfillment network, when a customer clicks the 'buy now' button on Amazon, the fulfillment center's central planning software sends one of 750k mobile robots to fetch inventory and purchased items in real time - we note robotics is a key component of Amazon's retail operations as it allows consumers to receive packages quicker - in 2012 Amazon purchased a robotics company called Kiva for $775 million. "...I think you're going to continue to see us invest very significantly in robotics." - Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO, from 3Q25 Earnings Call Exhibit 30 - Amazon's Robotics Acquisitions

Google has been pursuing its robotics ambitions since 2013; advancements in Gemini have propelled recent robotics research and development efforts. In March, Google DeepMind introduced two AI models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER. The goal is to make AI useful in the physical world to solve a wide variety of tasks, including ones it has never seen during training. · Gemini Robotics 1.5: Vision-language-action (VLA) model that can use vision, language, and action in the physical world. · Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5: Embodied reasoning model that specializes in understanding physical spaces, planning, and making logical decisions relating to its surroundings. Essentially, enhances Gemini Robotics' understanding of the world, with a particular focus on spatial reasoning. Building humanoid robots that extend their smart home ecosystem. Google has partnered with Apptronik to create the next generation of humanoid robots and has also partnered with over 60 trusted testers to guide the future of Gemini Robotics-ER.

Given Google's multiple smart home devices like Google Home and Nest, the move is a strategic alignment to integrate advanced robotic capabilities with its existing ecosystem, potentially paving the way for humanoid robots to serve as physical assistants within the smart home environment.

Source: Amazon Exhibit 36 - Google's and Approtronik Robot Source: Google Google's SIMA 2 Agents Are a Step Forward in the Future of Agents and Robots. Google's DeepMind launched SIMA 2 (Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent), an AI that follows basic instructions across a wide range of virtual environments. SIMA is crucial to teaching AI to translate language into action in 3D worlds. The latest version builds on the previous SIMA model, which was an instruction-based agent, but now includes interactive capabilities. This is a significant step in improving agent capabilities. SIMA 2 provides validation for a new path in action-oriented AI, confirming that an AI trained for broad competency can successfully unify the capabilities of many specialized systems into a single, coherent generalist agent. Additionally, DeepMind sees SIMA 2 as a step toward unlocking greater functionality and advances in robots.

The physical AI opportunity in smart glasses remains early, as both hardware and software advancements are needed to achieve mass adoption. We expect adoption of smart glasses to scale from improvements in technical capabilities, as a more robust hardware offering with a built-out developer base is likely to be the core driver of mainstream consumer adoption, along with advances in AI. Despite Meta's current lead in the smart-glass space, we expect its lead to be challenged by multiple deep-pocketed competitors, including GOOGL, AMZN, and APPL, which are developing competing offerings, and SNAP, which has a multi-year head start on its own smart-glasses investments. As well as pressure from Chinese companies like Baidu, which recently launched its own smart glasses powered by Qwen AI . We anticipate a winner-takes-most market, as developers are likely to focus their efforts on the largest platforms with the most significant reach. Ultimately, we think that the smart-glasses market, driven by the potential of Physical AI, is entering a highly competitive phase in 2026.

While the opportunity is still early, we think that the winner will likely be the platform that successfully combines 1) strong hardware, 2) creates a developer ecosystem similar to iPhone and Android, and 3) is powered by a leading AI. Meta Sets The Stage for The Next Major Form Factor. First to market, Meta formally announced the Meta Ray-Ban Display ($799) with an EMG wristband, marking its first smart glasses with a built-in AR display. We expect this step-function product enhancement to help Meta meaningfully expand its glasses sales beyond the roughly two million pairs sold since their October 2023 launch, supported by its affordable price point. We believe the hardware and corresponding subscription/app monetization are still multiple years away from becoming meaningful revenue contributors. Additionally, the company will need to meaningfully improve its AI to compete with Google, Amazon, and Chinese rivals. Google's Two AI Glasses Expected to Launch Next Year, Its Edge Could be Gemini. Google is developing two types of AI-powered glasses, powered by Gemini, and expected to launch next year.

The news comes as Meta is reportedly delaying its glasses launch to improve the product's quality . We think Google could surpass Meta in the smart glasses race, thanks to the performance of its Gemini model and its hardware expertise through Android. · AI-Powered Glasses: Will include built-in speakers, a microphone, and cameras, allowing users to chat with Gemini for assistance. The glasses will consist of an in-lens display that shows information such as directions. · Wired XR Glasses: Supported by Android XR, which are equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology. Similar to mixed reality, the devices layer digital content directly onto a user's view of the physical world. Users will be able to watch YouTube and extend the desktop screen when connected to a computer. The company also announced it is launching Developer Preview 3 of the Android XR SDK, which opens development for AI glasses by providing developers with the tools and APIs. This should help drive user usage and monetization.

Amazon is Using Smart Glasses to Improve Delivery Time. Amazon is taking an enterprise approach, developing smart glasses to help its delivery workers improve the delivery process. The glasses will allow the user to scan and identify packages, follow directions (without needing a phone), and capture proof of delivery. The enabled smart glasses should help shave off delivery time and are currently being trialed by drivers across North America. The company has yet to release any information on the actual efficiencies achieved with the glasses. Amazon offers consumer smart glasses with its Echo Frames; however, adoption is likely limited given the limited feature set.

2025 was a momentous year for autonomous mobility as it marked AV's transition from pilots to scaling commercial operations. In 2025, multiple cities approved driverless robotaxis and/or began testing for future deployment, with many additional cities expected to approve AVs in 2026. In passenger transportation, Waymo surpassed 100 million rider-only miles and over 1 million rides per month in San Francisco and Los Angeles. At the same time, in commercial trucking, Aurora launched driverless commercial freight operations across the Dallas-Houston and Fort Worth-El Paso lanes. As current momentum continues, we expect 2026 to be a critical validation year, with measured but material scale-up for major players - Waymo progressing toward 1 million trips per week (at 450,000 as of Dec 2025), Aurora deploying hundreds of trucks, and Tesla expanding to 8-10 metros. At the same time, we expect regulatory approvals to remain the pacing constraint in AV's expansion.

In 2025, robotaxis achieved meaningful operational scale - Waymo, which we believe is the current market leader, received approval for AV service at three airports and enabled freeway driving for rideronly trips across the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. At the same time, Tesla expanded beyond Austin and the Bay Area, securing ride-hailing approval in Arizona, reporting 250,000 driverless miles in Austin and over 1 million supervised miles in the Bay Area. Zoox launched its Explorers program (for free public rides) in San Francisco and scaled its manufacturing capacity to over 10,000 units per year, with Panasonic cell agreements starting in early 2026. Similarly, autonomous trucking converted to commercial driverless operations in 2025, with Aurora surpassing 100,000 driverless miles across the Dallas-Houston and Fort Worth-El Paso lanes, while targeting hundreds of driverless trucks by the end of 2026.

At the same time, Kodiak AI has achieved over 3 million autonomous miles across more than 10,000 loads and has delivered 8 of the initial 100-truck commercial orders from Atlas Energy Solutions. The company expects to launch long-haul driverless operations in the second half of 2026E. Over the last 12 months, Waymo has pulled ahead as the clear market leader. By the end of 2025, its AV fleet will be operating in 9 markets, up from 3 at the beginning of the year, with expectations to be operational in another eight markets by the end of 2026. Notably, the company is testing in 14 locations, including dense cities like New York and Tokyo, harsh weather conditions like Denver, Colorado, and Michigan, and different driving standards, such as those in London and Tokyo, which drive on the left-hand side.

Chinese government has established a policy to make China the world leader in driverless vehicles by 2035. It has begun aggressively issuing permits for robotaxi testing to stay competitive with the U.S. As a result, we've seen recently a notable expansion of operations by Baidu's Apollo Go, WeRide, and Pony AI. According to a BloombergNEF analysis, Apollo Go , WeRide , and Pony.ai are outnumbering their American competition with more robotaxi projects progressing from testing to various stages of commercialization. However, we note that much of this headway is made in China, where regulations are less strict, and the government heavily subsidizes operators. While the advances made by China's AV companies are impressive, we are cautious about the technology's potential in external markets due to China's less stringent regulations and testing polices.

Baidu Reaches 250K Weekly Robotaxi Rides but Behind Waymo's 450K. Baidu's Apollo Go AV taxi service has surpassed 250,000 weekly rides, but falls short of Waymo's 450K. However, Waymo's latest figure was reported in April and is likely to have increased since then. As we wrote above, the ramp in Baidu's Apollo Go comes as China's government continues to push for AV leadership. The growth in Apollo Go's weekly rides is likely benefiting from looser AV regulations. Baidu's Apollo Go primarily operates robotaxis in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, and has announced plans to expand to Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, and Switzerland. We could see roadblocks in this rollout due to other countries' more stringent regulatory requirements.

Pony AI Operations Break Even in Guangzhou. The company reported that its robotaxi operations in Guangzhou had broken even on a per-car basis, an early indication that AVs are becoming more economically viable. While the number of vehicles in Guangzhou is unknown, the company aims to expand its global fleet to more than 3,000 cars by 2026 and is on track to surpass its 1,000-car target this year, according to recent filings (exhibit 56).

2026 should convert 2025's momentum in AV pilots into scaling, revenue-bearing operations. Next year, we expect the autonomous vehicle industry to transition from proof-of-concept to business-model validation. Success likely hinges on achieving operational efficiency, demonstrating sustainable unit economics with high utilization, and maintaining safety standards as the business scales. Key leading indicators to track progress include: 1. Remote-ops ratio improvements, 2. Daily utilization hours approaching 18-20, 3. Vehicle bill-of-materials costs are trending toward the $50,000 profitability threshold, 4. CPUC approval timing, and 5. Airport access permits - all critical for investors assessing the path to commercial viability and operators balancing growth with safety validation requirements. Among the publicly announced 2026 plans, we want to highlight the following. - · Waymo - Maintains a fleet of roughly 2,500 robotaxis (as of Nov 2025) with plans to add at least another 1,000 by 2026. Announced metro launch pipelines include San Diego, Detroit, Las Vegas,

Minneapolis, Tampa, and New Orleans. In Miami and several TX/FL cities, the company has begun a phased rollout of rider access, while in Sacramento, it has expanded its service to driverless non-passenger operations. Lastly, its NYC testing permit was extended through Dec 2025. · Zoox - The company continues its paid service in Las Vegas and its supervised program in San Francisco. Fleet expansion is underpinned by ramping up its Hayward assembly facility and early-2026 Panasonic cell supply. · Tesla - The company's recent Arizona permit complements those in Austin and the Bay Area; further expansion toward its target of 8-10 metros depends on regulatory approvals. Unit economics are expected to continue improving, and several factors will impact their trend, including:

· CapEx - Alphabet signaled a 'significant' CapEx increase in 2026; as Waymo scales infrastructure, rising depreciation and energy costs will pressure the P&L in the near-term, while integrations with Gemini improve the in-car experience. · Partnerships - Lyft invests in depots and an integrated supply system with Waymo to maximize utilization; Avis manages fleet/charging for Waymo in Dallas with vehicles initially on Waymo's balance sheet. The AV regulatory backdrop is expected to improve, too, but most likely at a measured pace. The U.S. remains a patchwork of regulations - Florida and Arizona are relatively supportive; some metros impose monitors; local community pushback can add costs and constrain scaling; NHTSA reviews remain a headline risk. A handful of catalysts for investors to watch include:

1. Waymo's freeway operations performance and new rider-only city launches; 2. Zoox battery-backed fleet growth and addition of paid cities; 3. Tesla rider-only approvals and Cybercab ramp; 4. Expansion of airport access; and 5. Enterprise/transit integrations that drive utilization.

AMZN to Make $1B+ AI Acquisition in 2026: We believe 2026 will be the year AMZN makes a meaningful AI company investment or complete acquisition. We underscore our view by noting that AMZN is expected to spend $163B in CapEx in 2026E, most of which will go towards building out its cloud infrastructure to support the AI opportunity. Given this massive level of CapEx spend (aka investment), we would not be surprised to see AMZN make a $1B+ acquisition in the space that supports the investments it is already making in infrastructure. We believe this type of acquisition could be a tuck-in acquisition that supports the AWS business (possibly around security) or could even be an AI application-driven acquisition, such as an AI coding tool or a foundation model provider (recall AMZN has made significant investments in Anthropic).

AMZN has an AI Perception Issue: Since AI gained traction in 2022, most investors have perceived AWS and Amazon as lagging behind their core large-cap technology peers, including Microsoft and Alphabet. At times, from 2024-1H25, it felt that this perception has even worsened, as investors fear that AWS lacks a leading foundational model and owned-and-operated AI tools. As a result of this perception gap, AMZN's shares have meaningfully underperformed those of its bigtech peers over a multi-year period. While we believe AMZN's 3Q25 results helped reduce some of these fears, the perception remains, and we consider a meaningful acquisition in the space to be one of the quickest and best ways to remove these roadblocks to the story.

AMZN has Made Meaningful Investments in Anthropic: We remind investors that AMZN already has a tight relationship with Anthropic, a leading AI model provider. In November 2024, the two expanded their partnership, with AMZN investing an additional $4B into Anthropic (bringing the total investment to $8B) while Anthropic established AWS as its primary cloud and training partner. We highlight that Anthropic is likely too large at this point for AMZN to acquire fully, and there would likely be regulatory pushback, as well as existing stakeholders (GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA) who might oppose such a transaction. However we wouldn't be surprised if AMZN were to further lean into its ownership stake into Anthropic as they continue to raise capital to build out their Claude model and broader AI application product suite.

AMZN has Only Made a Handful of Sizable Acquisitions in Its History: We highlight that AMZN has only made six acquisitions over $1B and two over $5B, underscoring AMZN's ability to stand up internal businesses rather than relying on inorganic growth/acquisitions to drive growth and innovation. Importantly, we highlight that none of AMZN's 10 most significant acquisitions have a clear tie to AI, with Kiva Systems, a robotics company AMZN acquired in 2012, as the likely closest match to a sizable AI acquisition. While AMZN has not historically relied on M&A to drive growth and innovation, we believe the perception that it is behind in AI is so strong and that the AI opportunity is so important that it could lead management to make a massive acquisition to support it.

Opportunity for Creator Advertising and Social Commerce Remains Massive, Driven by Content Creators. Global Social commerce is growing rapidly and is expected to be worth $2 trillion by 2026 with a projected 25% CAGR . We continue to believe that Creators will be a driving factor of social commerce, given that 30% of US social media users have purchased something after seeing an influencer or creator post about it . Ultimately, Creators will continue to drive advertising revenue for YouTube and Meta, as YouTube and Facebook remain the most widely used online platforms for adults. A survey conducted by PEW found that 84% of U.S. adults report using YouTube, compared to 71% for Facebook and 50% for Instagram. Notably, adults under 30 are more likely than older adults to use YouTube (95%), Instagram (80%), and TikTok (63%) platforms. While YouTube is the most widely used online platform among U.S. teens , it will likely retain almost all its younger users as they age.

Given the data, we believe that content creator marketing has moved past brand awareness and is part of the conversion funnel, making it vital for platforms to support creator monetization. According to HubSpot , 61% of consumers trust influencers' recommendations more than traditional ads, and 74% of Gen Z say they prefer discovering products through Creators (Statista, 2024), underscoring the significant opportunity for social media platforms.

Role of AI Generative Apps and Content Unlikely to be Disruptive. Despite the popularity of AI generation apps like OpenAI's Sora, Meta's Vibes, and Google's Nano Banana, consumers increasingly have a negative perception of generative AI (Gen AI) in the creator economy, as 32% of consumers saw Gen AI as a harmful disruptor, up from 18% in 2023 . Additionally, as of this year, ~26% of consumers prefer Gen AI content to traditional consumer content, down from 60% in 2023. Given consumer sentiment, we do not see Gen AI content as a headwind to the creator economy. Conversely, we believe that influencer marketing will become increasingly valued for its authenticity and ability to build trust with consumers.

YouTube is one of the most powerful ad platforms globally with +2.5B MAU, and we believe it is best positioned to benefit from ongoing dramatic shifts in the broader media landscape as users consume more short-form video. Management noted on the 2Q25 call that improvements in platform discoverability are attributable to AI, which we believe should help ensure Creator content growth remains healthy and better position both YouTube and Creators. Combined with news tools for creators to better monetize their content, 2026E is set up for strong revenue growth. Strong Potential for Growth from Shorts, Audience Reach, and Expansion. YouTube Shorts launched in the U.S. in March 2021 and globally in July of the same year. Alphabet launched YouTube Shorts to empower the next generation of mobile-first Creators. It allows users to share short videos on YouTube, a product that is similar to and competes with TikTok and Instagram Reels.

YouTube mentioned in June that Shorts Daily Active Views reached 200 billion (+186% relative to March 2024, 88% CAGR since 1Q22), which should unlock incremental ad loads given greater reach potential. Growth from 2024 to 2Q25 was likely driven by Google's revenue-share monetization offering for YouTube Shorts, which allows new and existing Creators in the YouTube Partner Program to become eligible for revenue sharing on ads viewed within Shorts in the Shorts Feed. The ad revenue share program likely drove a 186% increase in DAUs by incentivizing Creators to generate more content, creating a flywheel of higher engagement and, in turn, higher advertising revenue. Given creators' massive influence and platforms' ability to monetize, we remain bullish on YouTube, as it rewards its Creators, likely driving higher usage on the platform relative to its competitors.

Per Emarketer , YouTube accounted for the most U.S. Creator payouts in 2024, with Creators keeping 45% of the revenue, creating a strong incentive for more Creators to publish content on the platform. Exhibit 52 - YouTube Short DAUs in Billions Source: BMO Capital Markets, Company Reports At the 2025 Made On YouTube event, the company announced various AI tools to streamline content launch for Creators, as well as multiple shopping and sponsored ad features for 2026. Ultimately, the new features should ensure Creator content growth remains healthy, positioning both YouTube and Creators on a path toward increased monetization. For 2026E, we estimate YouTube Ad revenue at roughly $40.7B (+14.2% YoY).

· Dynamic Sponsorship Ads for the Long-Form Video Format to Drive Higher Ad Revenue: The new format allows Creators to dynamically switch between brand-sponsored pop-ups on videos, allowing for more brand spots. Previously, Creators could only have one sponsored ad per video. This update is expected to drive higher ad revenue, as the format allows for more sponsored ads per video. It should also increase content on the platform as Creators will earn more from their videos, incentivizing more frequent content releases. We note that the product will begin testing in 2026E and is expected to help drive revenue growth throughout the year. · Shorts to Include External Links, Similar to TikTok: Creators can now add links to their Shorts. This will ultimately enable advertisers to understand brand traffic and conversions, potentially helping to drive higher CPMs for the platform. YouTube mentioned in June that Shorts' Daily Active Views are +186% relative to March 2024, with 200 billion daily views, which should unlock incremental ad loads given the greater reach potential.

· Bringing More Advertisers and Agencies onto YouTube with Creator Hub: The recently announced Creator Partnerships Hub, a tab within Google Ads, will help advertisers and agencies find and connect with Creators. · Supercharging YouTube Shopping with AI: Google's AI will now automatically identify and link products that are mentioned in videos. This should increase GMV, which the company notes has seen strong momentum on YouTube Shopping and has grown 5x year-over-year. · YouTube: Testing AI Overviews within Search: Announced in 2Q25, this is a natural extension of AI's revenue-generating capabilities, helping improve contextualization across videos and enhance content discovery for Creators. · YouTube Expands Data Sharing Between Creators and Brands: A greater data share between brands and Creators should improve targeting and expand reach for advertisers, effectively improving ROAS. The agreements eliminate friction, enabling creators and advertisers to work more effectively.

Exhibit 53 - YouTube Ad Revenue ($ in M) with BMO Estimates and YoY Growth (%) Source: BMO Capital Markets, Company Reports Video Podcasting is a Rapidly Growing Format with YouTube Leading the Way. Consumer demand and viewing of video podcasts is enormous. In February, YouTube announced that more than 1 billion monthly active viewers consume podcast content on the platform, and over 400 million hours of podcasts were watched in 2024. Despite podcasts' origins as an audio medium, 72% of podcast listeners say they prefer shows with video, according to a study by Cumulus Media. YouTube is the preferred platform for 39% of podcast viewers and listeners, ahead of Spotify at 21%. We continue to believe YouTube will lead the video podcasting market, given it offers a higher ad revenue share ( Creators on YouTube keep 55% compared to Spotify, providing Creators a 50/50 split ) and a much larger audience base compared to Spotify's 700M users.

Creators remain critical to Meta's apps, and we now project approximately $10.6 billion in payouts in 2025E (up from $9 billion previously), with upside potential to ensure effective content supply growth. Management noted that it continues to roll out new tools for Creators to ensure ongoing effective supply growth. While this is a net positive, the overall spending as a percentage of advertising revenue remains significantly lower than YouTube's, which could lead Creators to move off-platform. Meta Has Meaningful Tailwinds Ahead.... A recent check with our expert believes META growth could accelerate in 2026E primarily due to four key factors:

1. Meta will benefit from deeper monetization of its inventory through overlay ads on top of creator content, as 75% of Facebook/Instagram content is currently not monetized, and WhatsApp for Business. 2. Meta is best positioned to capture 50% of the decline in SEO spending. 3. The rollout of Meta Business AI, potentially in 1Q26E, is likely to drive higher SMB ad spending on the platform. 4. 2026E is expected to see a ramp in ad spend by Temu and Shein, following the two companies' pullback in 2025E due to tariff impacts. ....Though Beware of TikTok's Return and Financial Risks from Meta's Evolving Approach to Creator Payouts. We continue to view competitive threats from TikTok and YouTube, potential issues retaining Creator talent, and uncertainty around AI ROI as future challenges for the platform.

· Performance-Based Payouts per Creator Remain Low. Instagram is shifting from traditional revenue share to performance-based bonuses for content creators. While these bonuses are becoming more frequent, the majority of Creators (about 72% of 200 million globally) still earn less than $500 annually from their content. Recently, Instagram shut down a program allowing Creators to earn revenue from advertisements placed between content on their profiles , potentially reducing content and engagement on the app. · Potential Margin Headwind If Payout Model Changes. Meta is testing skippable ads on Instagram and could move to a traditional revenue share model (like YouTube's for long-form content), which could increase costs by $3-5 billion annually and risk burning free cash flow (FCF) before the program becomes profitable. The company is currently testing and iterating these models, especially for short-form video, where attribution and ROI are more challenging than for photos.

· Return of TikTok Likely to Impact 2026E. Meta's 2026E growth could face headwinds from TikTok, which could recapture ad spending lost primarily to Meta in 2025E. TikTok's advertisers shifted spending off the platform following the unknown status of the company operating in the U.S. With the likely upcoming durable return of the platform online, our expert estimates that TikTok's U.S. Ad revenue could grow from approximately $8B in 2025E to roughly $12-13B in 2026E (+56% YoY at midpoint). The shift in ad spending back to TikTok is expected to ramp up throughout 2026E, with the most significant impact on Meta and other platforms in 2H26E. · Video Competition from TikTok and YouTube. TikTok leads in short-term discoverability, while YouTube dominates long-form and is putting increasing pressure on Meta with YouTube Shorts. Pressure from the two platforms could push Meta to increase payouts to keep Creators in its ecosystem.

· ROI and AI Investment is Still Too Soon to Tell. Meta is investing heavily in AI to improve content recommendations and monetization, but the timing for a return on these investments remains uncertain. The company is balancing between rapid content success (like TikTok's 'For You' feed) and maintaining content quality. Additionally, after being hit with a €200M fine by EU regulators, META will now offer Facebook and Instagram users an alternative choice that shows fewer personalized ads and gives users the option to share less data in order to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act. We note that in 3Q25, revenue from Europe contributed 25% to Meta's total advertising revenue and could be a potential headwind to 2026E growth.

Regulation and Tech Advancements Drive Rise in Internet Age Verification: Increased regulatory focus and advancements in industry capabilities are driving increased age verification across the internet, as regulators look to keep users (specifically children) safe online. We highlight that the UK has passed an Online Safety Act aimed at driving online identity verification, as have Australia and other countries, as they look to leverage improvements in technology to force increased regulation around the internet, specifically adding guardrails around the content (and people) that children/minors can interact with online. One Thing For Sure: Online Verification Will Change The Internet Forever As these digital verification tools proliferate, we believe the Internet will change permanently, with some businesses, websites, and platforms seeing more severe impacts than others.

Notably, while some of these verification efforts will be driven by de-platforming users who should not be engaging with the content, we believe the need to provide facial ID and government ID verification could provide friction even for people who are allowed to view the content, as users will be less inclined to view/purchase certain content if they need to provide identification. Several companies within our coverage universe have recently discussed using age-verification tools to verify users' ages on their platforms.

3Q25 Call: "We're also aware that the new safety policies we're rolling out, consistent with our commitment to being the gold standard for safety, may cause some short-term friction with engagement and bookings, but ultimately, we think they will be a catalyst for long-term growth."

3Q25 Call: "We are also preparing for the upcoming rollout of platform-level age verification, which will use new signals provided by Apple, and soon Google, to help us better determine the age of our users and remove those we learn are under 13, or under 16 in certain geographies such as Australia. These actions are an essential step in maintaining a safe and compliant platform, though we expect they will also adversely affect engagement metrics as implementation progresses. In addition to these internal initiatives, we continue to experience the effects of regulation and government policy actions. Recent examples include Australia's Social Media Minimum Age Bill, which takes effect in December, and government restrictions on access to internet services in certain countries. We anticipate that similar regulations in other jurisdictions may take effect or be passed in the near future. These policy developments, combined with potential platform-level age verification, are likely to have negative impacts on user engagement metrics that we cannot currently predict."

3Q25 Call: "Building and maintaining that trust is core to our long-term success, which is why we're doubling down on trust and safety across our platforms. Nowhere is that more evident than at Tinder, where we're integrating safety directly into the product experience like never before. The centerpiece of this effort is Face Check, our new facial verification feature that helps confirm users are real and match their profile photos. It's now required for all new users in California, Colombia, Canada, India, Australia, and Southeast Asia, and will roll out to additional US states and countries in the coming months. Face Check sets a new standard for authenticity. Using only a short video selfie, it helps confirm a user is real and matches their profile photos. We built this technology with care, ensuring it delivers meaningful improvements to trust and safety, while keeping the user experience seamless. Early results are strong and reinforce our confidence in the long-term benefits to the broader ecosystem. We have seen a 60% reduction in user views of profiles later identified as bad actors and a 40% decrease in reports of bad actor activity.

Our ongoing optimization efforts have resulted in only a low single-digit impact on monthly active users and revenue in test markets, which lessens over time."

OpenAI uses age prediction to determine whether a user is over 18. If OpenAI believes a user is under 18, they apply an experience with extra content protections, including graphic and gory content, things that could risk harmful behavior, including sexual, romantic, or violent role play, and content that promotes extreme beauty standards. Character.AI is banning users under 18 from having open-ended chats with its AI. Character AI uses an in-house "age assurance model" to classify a user's age based on both first-party and third-party data.

Persona is one of the leading online identification companies, working with several leading online companies, including OpenAI, Reddit, Lyft, LinkedIn, and others. While Persona works with many players online, from a child safety perspective, its tools are also valuable to financial institutions, which can use them to stop fraud, theft, and other threats to financial services.

The image below walks through how age verification for Roblox's 152 million DAUs works: users provide a one-time facial scan showing both their side profile and a forward-facing image of their face. Based on these images, the age verification process can provide a rough estimate of the user's age. However, we question the effectiveness of a one-time facial age-estimation process, as bad actors are likely to use their access to minors to scan their faces during the one-time authorization process to present themselves as younger users. Instead, we believe facial age estimation and broader online identity may need to be used on a case-bycase basis, which will help eliminate one-time fraudulent verification processes but also introduce friction in the user experience.

User-Generated Content (UGC) in gaming is when a gaming platform provides its broader user base and community with the tools needed to build their own games on the platform. Through the platform's tools, users can build their own games, with their own maps and rules, creating truly new, custom gaming experiences. After users create their game, they can include monetization hooks, which allow the platform to keep a portion of those sales and pay out a portion to the UGC game Creator. The essence of UGC gaming reminds us of social platforms where content creators create user-generated content that is then monetized by the platform, with revenue shared with the Creators.

We expect User-Generated-Content (UGC) to be a key theme in the video game industry in 2026, as leading gaming platforms look to lean more into the opportunity following the success of Roblox in 2025. We remind investors that UGC in gaming has been around for decades, as many games have always offered users tools to create unique experiences and mini-games within existing gaming ecosystems. As an example, think about custom games in the early days of Halo, in which players were given the tools and ability to edit maps and create specific game rules, allowing them to create their own experience in a custom version of the game. However, UGC has made meaningful strides since then , as platforms like RBLX have taken the opportunity to a new level by lowering the barrier to game development, allowing anyone to build a robust gaming experience. We highlight that 2025E is shaping up to be a breakout year for RBLX and the UGC opportunity, with RBLX expected to grow its Bookings by 50% YoY to $6.5B, giving it ~3% of the global video game market.

Exhibit 61 - RBLX Bookings (in $M) and YoY Bookings Growth Source: BMO Capital Markets, FactSet Roblox has already Scaled a Massive UGC Creator Community We highlight that RBLX has already done the most challenging part of creating a successful UGC gaming platform, scaling the developer base. We believe a large developer base is the most critical part of the puzzle, as it incentivizes users to come to the platform to play the games Creators have made. This, in turn, creates a flywheel in which more players on the platform drive more and higher-quality developers to make games on the platform, which leads to more players and so on. RBLX has provided historical disclosures about its developer base, and in 2023, it offered a funnel that showed the breadth and depth of its UGC developer base.

In 2023, RBLX had 5 million Creators on the platform earning payouts, with over 12,700 earning over $1,000 a year, 96 earning over $1M a year, and 9 developers or Creators earning over $10M a year. We believe these numbers have only continued to grow meaningfully over the last two years.

Epic has already signaled they are leaning into UGC with Fortnite - We discussed this theme at length in our UGC developer economics deep dive . In our note, we highlight the meaningful economic incentive Epic Games is offering to UGC game developers to encourage them to build their next hit game on the RBLX platform. Importantly, Epic Games recently highlighted that Fortnite has scaled to 100M MAUs, with 40% of playtime going to UGC, where UGC developers earn "hundreds of millions of dollars a year" from their content. For perspective, we highlight that 100% of playtime on Roblox is spent on user-generated content, with Roblox's 152M DAUs helping developers on the platform generate $1.5B+ annually.

Epic Games Leaned in Further to UGC Through a Recently Announced Partnership with Unity: Unity and Epic Games announced a partnership on November 19, 2025 , in which they will bring Unity games into the Fortnite ecosystem. As a result, developers will be able to publish Unity games on Fortnite and participate in the Fortnite Creator Economy, ultimately broadening Fortnite's scale in the UGC gaming opportunity. We wrote about this extensively in our note here . We Suspect GTA VI Will Include a UGC Component: We believe the upcoming launch of GTA VI in November 2026 will help to serve as TTWO's entry point into the UGC space. We remind investors that TTWO acquired FiveM in August 2023, which, at the time, was essentially doing unlicensed UGC on the GTA V ecosystem. We believe they acquired FiveM after sending them a cease-and-desist order, as they realized there was a real economic opportunity to support UGC environments in GTA.

As a result, we believe GTA VI will serve as a meaningful entry point for TTWO into the UGC space and will be underpinned by their acquisition of FiveM. We believe GTA's positioning as a mature-rated game with a massive open-world environment presents an attractive opportunity for UGC developers to build unique UGC experiences in a gigantic, high-fidelity sandbox.

Importantly, while we believe RBLX has a meaningful head start in scaling a UGC-driven business, we expect competition to meaningfully ramp in 2026 ( Fortnite , GTA VI , etc.). While we expect RBLX to maintain its leadership position in UGC in 2026, we believe that ramping competition could pose a risk to its longer-term opportunity as competitors scale their offerings. However, we believe one thing is clear: the UGC opportunity in gaming is likely still in its early innings, and its proliferation has the potential to change the long-term growth outlook for the broader video game industry. RBLX Alone Represents a $1.5B+ Annual Opportunity for UGC Developers: The economic incentive is clear for UGC game developers, as RBLX has scaled to a $6B+ in Bookings business that offers a $1.5B+ (and growing) economic earn-out opportunity for developers on its platform.

We believe this massive pool of developer payments serves as something of a moat for Roblox in the near term, as we expect UGC game developers to focus on platforms that offer the most significant economic payout opportunity, which we believe is clearly Roblox today. Exhibit 64 - RBLX Developer Exchnage (DexEx) Fees and DevEx as a Percent of Bookings RBLX is $1B Economic Opportunity for UGC Developers Source: BMO Capital Markets, Company Reports, FactSet Scale Matters in UGC: We believe scale is the most critical factor in any UGC opportunity, as UGC creators will focus on platforms with the largest user bases and payout pools, offering the most significant economic opportunity. In gaming, that scaled platform is clearly RBLX, whose 152M DAUs is ~50% larger than Fortnite's ~100M MAUs.

Similar to most other Internet verticals, online travel has experienced a material transformation in 2025. On the one hand, consumer preferences continue to shift towards experiences (with related travel), and travel decisions are increasingly influenced by social media, while on the other hand, technology, and AI in particular, is profoundly reshaping the user experience. Over the past several years, travel has benefited from a long-term trend in consumer preferences that we expect to continue unfolding in the immediate future. A multi-decade shift is underway as consumer preferences have moved away from material possessions towards experiences and live events, with an accompanying increase in travel or experience tourism. With several major sporting events in 2026 - including the 2026 Winter Olympics/Paralympics and the 2026 FIFA World Cup - we expect this shift to gain further momentum, with travel remaining a significant beneficiary.

A long-term structural trend is underway, with consumers increasingly prioritizing experiences and live events over material possessions. · Shift in Spending Patterns: Consumer spending on experiences is projected to account for 32% of U.S. discretionary expenditures by 2030, up from 22% in 1985. · Resilient Demand Despite Inflation: Even with stickier-than-expected inflation, consumers continue to favor out-of-home entertainment. As of 3Q25, 46% of consumers plan to maintain current spending over the next three months, and 18% expect to increase spending. Exhibit 66 - U.S. Consumer Discrentionary Spend Over the Next 3 Months (3Q25), Compared to Usual, for Entertainment Away From Home Source: BMO Capital Markets, McKinsey Analyzing spending in experiences across age groups, millennial and Gen Z consumers are increasingly prioritizing spending on live events over traditional financial goals, such as saving or purchasing a home.

According to McKinsey, 19% of surveyed consumers globally plan to cut back in non-discretionary categories while splurging in discretionary areas, which represents a clear benefit for the online travel ecosystem. Gen Z's spending is growing at twice the rate of previous generations at the same age and is on track to surpass the global expenditures of baby boomers by 2029. By 2035, Gen Z is expected to contribute an additional $8.9 trillion to the worldwide economy, reinforcing the long-term demand for live experiences and related travel, positioning online travel to capture significant growth.

Intent to splurge; 02 2025, % of respondents Source: McKinsey As the shift towards experiences unfolds, the importance of travel in consumers' lives remains high. According to research conducted in February and early March 2025 for Expedia's 2025 Traveler Value Index, drawing on insights from over 11,000 consumers across 11 global markets, travel remains a top priority, with 50% of consumers saying it is more vital now than five years ago. Further underscoring travel's enduring importance is the finding that 88% of consumers planned to take a leisure trip in the following 12 months, and 68% were likely to book international travel - a 19% increase since 2022 - despite ongoing politico-economic uncertainties.

At the same time, discovery and demand creation in travel are moving upstream to mobile super-apps, creator-led social, and AI assistants, compressing the planning-to-booking cycle and rewarding closedloop, data-rich environments. Social discovery and influencer commerce are becoming increasingly more important in travel at the upper end of the funnel. Another set of insights from Expedia's 2025 Traveler Value Index survey shows that travelers are increasingly turning to social media for trip inspiration: · 61% said they find trip ideas on platforms, up from 35% in 2022, and · 73% said influencer recommendations have swayed their decision to book a trip or travel component. Importantly, younger travelers, particularly those under 40, are more strongly influenced by social media, with 84% reporting that influencer recommendations have affected their booking decisions.

Similarly, independent industry research also shows the increased importance of social media in travel, indicating it influences destination choices more than traditional media or even friends and family. But it also shows that social media's ability to convert and monetize these inspirations into actual bookings is coming short. According to Skift's State of Travel 2025 report, roughly 60% of travelers say they feel comfortable booking through social channels. However, the actual conversion rate remains relatively low, estimated at under 10% by Sabre. This should not be surprising, given the higher complexity and higher price tag associated with travel purchases.

We believe that AI will be the technology that shortens, if not eliminates, the monetization gap between inspiration and bookings. We are already seeing how AI-powered inspiration and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) are reshaping the playing field in travel. As consumers get more comfortable with AI assistants and tools, we believe that AI-native capabilities will become critical in the travel industry. Not surprisingly, a March 2025 survey by Deloitte revealed a 50% increase in AI-assisted trip planning, with 15% of travelers reporting using Gen AI tools, up from 10% in 2024. And once again, millennial and Gen Z travelers were the age groups reporting the highest AI-assisted trip-planning usage - both at 23%.

A more recent consumer survey by McKinsey , conducted in June - July 2025, indicates even higher growth in the use of Gen AI for trip planning. It shows that the share of consumers who use ChatGPT and similar tools extensively to plan any aspect of their trip has more than doubled over the past year, increasing from 13% in 2024 to 30% in 2025E.

Agentic AI Becomes the New Operating System in Travel We think that multilingual chatbots, AI assistants, natural-language search, and AI-assisted trip planning are only the beginning. In 2026, we expect current consumer-facing AI tools to evolve from planning concierge-type into end-to-end transacting agents linked to first-party identity-rich data and loyalty wallets. We also see AI-powered real-time personalization becoming a competitive moat. Ultimately, we expect agentic AI to become the new operating system in travel - from discovery to booking to on-destination servicing. Online travel should remain one of the biggest beneficiaries of new AI capabilities Over the past 12 months, AI chatbots have significantly improved customer service levels across the industry with faster and more accurate query responses.

At the same time, listing creation has noticeably improved with AI image models and tools that enhance listing quality for hosts, improving descriptions and the overall customer experience. From a P&L perspective, we see early operational efficiencies with a measurable impact from the broader adoption of AI. Looking ahead, personalization capabilities will remain a tailwind for supply and demand, and next-gen AI solutions will increasingly surface the right product to the right traveler at the right time. In other words, users will discover destinations they had never thought of visiting before. We expect the platforms to increasingly cross-sell across their offerings to ensure a high-quality user experience. As a result, we believe the path from discovery to booking will continue to shorten.

Consumers are entering 2026 with mixed macro signals - price increases have moderated but remain elevated, hiring has cooled, but wage growth on average is positive in real terms. Survey-based confidence is weak even as card networks report solid spending. As a result, a K-shaped economy is emerging, with the top 10-20% of consumers - supported by asset wealth - largely shrugging off mid-single-digit inflation. In comparison, middle America feels the impact of 30% cumulative post-pandemic price increases despite recent real wage gains. We are also seeing non-prime borrowers increasingly relying on credit to maintain spending, signaling greater financial strain among vulnerable households. Younger generations are facing disproportionate financial pressure too, with total monthly debt payments up 20% for millennials and 27% for Gen Z, outpacing both inflation and wage growth.

As a result, all income groups are adopting a value-first playbook - making more frequent trips with smaller baskets and embracing private label brands, with retailers like Walmart seeing grocery private brand penetration rise 60 basis points year-over-year. Lower- and middle-income households are aggressively cutting discretionary spending and relying heavily on discounters and extreme-value programs, while high-income consumers maintain premium purchases but increasingly shop at value-focused retailers. Consumer spending is shifting toward essentials, with retail food and beverage dollars rising while discretionary general merchandise declining, and grocers reporting significant trade-down within categories. We note that payment networks report resilient spending in the U.S. despite consumer sentiment hitting its second-lowest point on record in November, per recent University of Michigan data.

The Fed's preferred gauge shows inflation is stabilizing but still above target - the core PCE price index (ex-food and energy) rose 2.8% year-over-year in September, vs. +2.9% in August, +2.9% in July, and +2.8% in June. However, September headline inflation inched higher to +2.8% year-over-year, vs. +2.7% in August, +2.6% in July, and +2.6% in June. Trade policy is feeding through to goods, with increasing evidence that tariffs are adding stickiness to goods inflation, which is being passed through to consumers, with expectations for continued impact in 2026. Labor market momentum cooled through late summer and continued to slow down in September as three-month job gains (July-September) totaled 62,000 and the unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, the highest in four years. While not a sharp contraction, the deceleration and layoff headlines are visible to consumers and weigh on sentiment.

The Atlanta Fed's tracker shows nominal wage growth running near 4.1%, implying modest real gains against roughly 3% inflation, supported by BLS reporting real average hourly earnings increasing 0.8% year-over-year in September. However, the personal saving rate remains subdued at ~4.7% (September), limiting the capacity to absorb shocks for lower-income households.

At the same time, Equifax identified a widening strain for non-prime borrowers, with the share of bankcard debt held by this group surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Their total bankcard balances rose 135% from May 2021 to May 2025, versus 54% for all borrowers, signaling greater reliance on revolving credit among vulnerable households. CFPB data show BNPL adoption surged, too, with approvals rising and deep-subprime/subprime borrowers comprising a large share of originations. Late payments are common (roughly 41% of users report a late payment), and loan stacking is frequent, increasing near-term payment risk for lower-credit consumers.

According to the latest University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, consumer confidence in November 2025 reached its lowest level since June 2022 and the second-lowest level on record (back to 1952). Preliminary results for December show that the Index improved 2.3 pts sequentially, but it has been declining year-over-year since the start of 2025. Exhibit 69 - Consumer Sentiment Index and YoY and MoM Change - * December 2025 preliminary results Source: University of Michigan, BMO Capital Markets Similarly, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell 6.8 points in November to a 7-month low of 88.7. Both the assessment of the present situation (down 4.3 points to a 14-month low of 126.9) and expectations (down 8.6 points, 4th drop in a row, to a 7-month low of 63.2) took a hit, with the latter below the recession-signal threshold of 80 for the tenth straight month.

In contrast, payment networks report resilient spending in the U.S. , at least through September. Visa's payments volume (both debit and credit) grew 8% year-over-year in F4Q25 (ending Sep 30), with higher-spending cardholders driving a larger share of growth. Management also reiterated broad-based strength across categories and channels in 4Q25E, while acknowledging rising uncertainty. Mastercard similarly cited healthy consumer spending in 3Q25, amid a generally supportive macroeconomic environment, including fairly steady inflation and well-balanced labor markets. The company saw U.S. payments volume (both debit and credit) grow 7% year-over-year in 3Q25.

As a result, consumer spend is tilting toward essentials and value-driven baskets, with retail food and beverage dollars up and discretionary general merchandise down, signaling a durable mix shift. Affluent-led discretionary resilience remains evident in travel and digital commerce, with Visa noting the highest spend band continues to grow fastest, travel improved sequentially, and U.S. eCommerce is expanding faster than in-store spend. Holiday trackers corroborate eCommerce outperformance and sustained restaurant demand during peak events. Notable mix shifts driven by changing consumer behavior include: · Food-at-home gaining share - retail food and beverage dollars rose while discretionary general merchandise declined. · Home-related categories are showing momentum online - furniture is forecast to grow, and consumers are upgrading home items on deal days. · Travel remains resilient - cross-border volumes improved, with top-spend cohorts leading growth.

· Restaurants grew 4.5% on Black Friday, reflecting demand for experiences. · Grocers see private labels outperform national brands amid elevated promotions and commodity pressures, underscoring broad trade-down dynamics. · Club retailers report a record in own-brand penetration as members seek value. · Mass/discount formats and superstores are taking share, fueling a surge in store-brand SKUs.

As retailers clear their safety stock, accumulated earlier in the year in anticipation of announced tariffs, newly-sourced inventory is expected to hit margins. We believe larger players will try to press suppliers to absorb part of these costs, while smaller vendors struggle to re-source, narrowing assortment. Industry experts suggest ~80% tariff pass-through to consumer prices. Given that, we don't think this is a good setup for retail sales heading into 2026, especially since consumers continue to cite the burden of high prices as a significant concern. As a result, we expect overall consumer trends observed in 2H25 to continue into 2026 and potentially accelerate if the macro picture deteriorates. Still, stress should remain concentrated in lower-income and near-prime cohorts, while the affluent-cohort spend remains resilient. We also expect off-price models to capture a bigger share of consumers' wallets.

That said, we expect lower-income consumers, most of whom are exposed to shelter/rent shocks that crowd out non-essential spending, to increase their use of dollar-value channels. For middle-income consumers, we expect to see broad value-seeking and selective pullbacks in discretionary spend, with home purchases increasingly timed to promotions. Lastly, we expect high-income consumers to sustain their elevated level of spending, particularly on travel and experiences, while favoring club and online channels.

Below, we walk through our predictions from our 2025 outlook and grade ourselves on our performance.

We are still in the early innings of the AI wave Following the November 2022 release of ChatGPT, the tech industry (and most industries) has reoriented its priorities toward AI business opportunities and internal cost efficiencies. We believe that the last three years (2023-2025) have been centered around foundational model development, in which leading model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI have invested tens of billions of dollars to build powerful AI models that can support a range of business and consumer applications to be built on top of them. While apps have been developed over the last several years (ChatGPT, Replit, Windsurf, Cursor, Hebbia, and others), we believe this is only the start of the AI app build-out, and the next few years will be defined by AI productization and applications. As a result, we expect inference spend within cloud computing environments to meaningfully scale as these applications are built and gain consumer and enterprise adoption, as AI-driven token spend ultimately drives datacenter inference costs.

AI Adoption Remains Early as Most Enterprises are Still in the Testing Phase - According to a November 2025 State of AI report from McKinsey , the AI opportunity remains very early in its penetration of the enterprise. In their survey, only 7% of respondents suggested that AI has been fully deployed and integrated across their entire organizations, with 31% saying it is "scaling", 30% saying they are "piloting", and 32% still "experimenting". We believe this early adoption cycle underscores that we are still in the early innings of the broader AI opportunity, as we expect every enterprise to have fully scaled AI solutions across their organization when the AI opportunity reaches maturity. AWS and GCP remain well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift in IT spending to the Cloud. AI workload growth will continue for the next several years, with AWS and GCP net beneficiaries. We believe Cloud providers with best-in-class full-stack gen AI offerings will garner incremental Cloud dollars.

Phase of Organization's Use of AI, by Company Revenues, % of Respondents Source: BMO Capital Markets, McKinsey Looking ahead to 2026, we expect companies to accelerate their internal AI spend, which should continue to improve productivity and limit the potential for headcount cost creep. In other words, companies will continue trading OpEx for CapEx in the upcoming year. Given this backdrop, we see stable-to-growing wallet-share gains for both AWS and GCP in 2026 and beyond.

The picks-and-shovels providers (NVDA, AWS, Azure, GCP) have been clear early beneficiaries of the AI build-out, as their offerings are the foundation-level tools that enable businesses to pursue the AI opportunity. We believe these companies are likely to continue to benefit from the AI opportunity as model providers continue to aggressively train foundational models on top of cloud providers and application builders build apps that will sit on top of cloud providers.

While access to high-performance GPUs from NVIDIA has been a key constraint on scaling AI, we believe we are starting to shift from hardware-related bottlenecks to energy-related bottlenecks, as cloud providers struggle to find sufficient power capacity to support their infrastructure build-out. We highlight that on the 3Q25 earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated: "So, we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity. Today, overall in the industry, maybe the bottleneck is power. I think at some point, it may move to chips, but we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity. And as fast as we're bringing it in right now, we are monetizing it."

We are starting to see meaningful accelerations in some cloud vendor backlogs as a result of companies signing massive multi-year contracts with cloud providers. · ORCL (covered by BMO analyst Keith Bachman) was among the first to see a massive backlog growth following a $300B/5-year contract with OpenAI, leading to a significant sequential increase in its backlog. · We have since seen GOOGL experience a similar (though smaller) acceleration, as they signed more $1B+ deals between 1Q25-3Q25 than in all of 2023 and 2024 combined. In 3Q25, GOOGL's backlog accelerated to 79% YoY growth, accelerating meaningfully from 37% growth in 2Q25.

· While AMZN's YoY backlog growth actually decelerated in 3Q25, management noted that it did not include several unannounced new deals in October, which, combined, are more than the total deal volume observed in 3Q, suggesting that AMZN is set up for a meaningful acceleration in 4Q25 backlog growth. Notably, only a few days after these comments, AMZN also signed $38 billion, 7year deal to support OpenAI, suggesting backlog growth could be even more robust. In short, we believe that strong, ramping backlog growth should support strong growth in the cloud industry over the next several years.

There are Three Core Layers to The Cloud: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are the key layers to the cloud offering, which stand for Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service, in which customers can purchase these products as an ongoing subscription service rather than having to make capital-intensive purchases.

IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service provides customers with core cloud resources such as storage, compute, networking, and virtualization, allowing them to benefit from a datacenter without owning or managing the day-to-day operations. Additionally, customers can flex their usage up and down to meet their specific needs, which is essential for those with seasonal spikes in compute needs, as they cannot just rent additional capacity when needed and leave it idle for the majority of the year when they do not need it. PaaS: Platform as a Service involves the delivery and management of both the hardware and software resources to develop apps through the cloud. Customers using PaaS can create, run, and manage their apps without maintaining the infrastructure that supports them.

SaaS: Software as a Service is the application stack in which user-facing products and applications are delivered to an end user in a cloud-based environment. SaaS products are typically paid for on a recurring revenue model in which a user pays the application owner a monthly or annual fee to access the software, and the app is typically run through a web browser, eliminating the need for the end user to download/install software directly onto their device. SaaS to Remain The Largest Portion of Cloud Market: The SaaS portion of the cloud is expected to remain the most significant contributor to the broader cloud market, as it directly supports revenuegenerating applications for businesses.

Primarily related to AWS Source: BMO Capital Markets, Company Reports Exhibit 74 - Breakdown of the Broader Cloud Market (in $B) Source: Gartner, BMO Capital Markets IaaS to Remain the Fastest Growing Part of the Cloud Market: Infrastructure as a Service is expected to be the fastest growing component of the cloud, as hyperscalers continue to deeply invest behind building out the infrastructure that will allow them to support AI applications at scale. Exhibit 75 - Cloud Market Growth by Segement Source: Gartner, BMO Capital Markets AWS remains a leader in Cloud services, with significant AI capabilities We show the market share of IaaS, which indicates that it is a formidable player across IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS categories. IDC defines public cloud infrastructure as a service that aggregates compute, raw, ephemeral, and persistent storage capacity, along with the associated network capabilities, delivered through a public cloud deployment model.

Furthermore, we show the SaaS/PaaS market share, highlighting a more fragmented market (62% share for long-tail cloud providers versus 17.7% for IaaS). Amazon will see significant tailwinds from accelerating IT spending, shifting to the Cloud, and incremental AI workloads. Specifically, AWS offers Trainium / Inferentia in addition to Nvidia chips, Bedrock for clients looking to scale LLM capabilities, and Q/Rufus at the application layer. Bedrock offers users the broadest model selection and continues to improve its offering by onboarding more leading models, giving customers a choice of the foundational model that is best for them. Given advanced code generation, visual analysis, and complex customer queries, Claude's models resonate very well with customers. For example, at re:Invent 2024, one session highlighted that DoorDash leverages Claude to power its customer solution center, thereby lowering response times.

Furthermore, Anthropic announced that computer use is in public beta, which allows Claude to perform tasks by interpreting and understanding screenshots and automatically adjusting the necessary computer commands. - · Specific use cases for computers include automated software testing with graphical user interfaces and integrations with software or apps that do not offer API access. In addition, automating repetitive tasks requiring UI interactions and onboarding, and supporting UI systems. In addition, Prompt Management and fine-tuning features are also gaining user adoption. Separately, SageMaker helps prepare data for AI training and deploy it into production. SageMaker Studio helps developers create models. The user accepts 37% of the code written by Amazon Q, as the tool has helped to write +200k lines of code into production. A case study with NAB showed that code recommendations achieved a 50% acceptance rate, driving a 40%+ productivity improvement.

That said, with 'hundreds of thousands' of customers running AI/ML workloads on AWS, significant adoption potential remains ahead - AWS noted during 3Q24 in October that its AI business is growing in the triple-digit percentages Y/Y. Impressively, we highlight that AWS is already executing AI at scale for enterprise customers, as they underscored at re:Invent 2025 that they have over 50 customers who are processing over 1 trillion tokens on AWS, which is higher than the October 2025 disclosure from OpenAI when they said they have 30 customers processing over 1T tokens. We believe this underscores the massive AI business AWS has already built, with 50+ customers relying on it to run their scaled AI workloads. More broadly, AWS is heavily leveraging AI internally in its business, having built 21k agents since July 2025 and seeing AI automation deliver $2B+ in annual cost savings, which we expect will meaningfully increase over time.

TPUs are designed to enable Google AI to operate on devices as they can handle higher-performance computation. These chips also support video rendering, gameplay, HDR photo editing, and language translation. When combined with Google's 20+ years of ML/AI innovation, we believe this positions the company well to benefit from next-generation AI solutions internally and externally. GOOGL's TPUs Continue to See Meaningful Improvements with Each Generation: The Ironwood TPU generation (7th generation) represents a meaningful improvement from its prior generation, with 4x better performance per chip for both training and inference workloads vs the last generation. Ironwood can scale up to 9,216 chips in a superpod. Additionally, as highlighted in the chart below, Ironwood TPU has a TFlops/Watt ratio of 29.3x, up meaningfully from 14.6x/5.2x in the prior two generations, respectively, underscoring the power efficiency of TPUs and their continued advancements.

While Google has been receiving credit for its own custom chip initiatives, we also highlight that Amazon has similarly been investing in the opportunity, as it continues to scale adoption of its Trainium and Inferentia hardware. Notably, we highlight that Amazon recently opened a new datacenter called "Project Rainier" , a purpose-built facility dedicated to servicing Anthropic. Importantly, we highlight that this datacenter houses 500k Trainium2 chips, as Anthropic plans to scale to more than 1 million chips by the end of 2025 (for both training and inference), underscoring Amazon's own success in custom silicon. Impressively, before the opening of this datacenter in 4Q25, management highlighted on the 3Q25 earnings call that Trainium2 is a multi-billion-dollar business that grew 150% sequentially.

While we believe GOOGL's TPU architecture is superior to Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, we do think it offers a similar value prop to customers who want a more energy and cost-efficient way to train and run AI models. We believe both Amazon and Google will benefit from the same trends and should benefit as they scale their offerings over time. Further, AMZN has brought Trainium3 to general availability, as the new generation of chips delivers 4.4x more compute performance, 4x greater energy efficiency, and 4x the memory bandwidth vs its predecessor. Additionally, AWS has already begun work on Trainium4, which it expects will deliver a massive leap over Trainium3, with 6x better FP4, 4x memory bandwidth, and 2x memory capacity, as AWS continues to iterate on its tech stack at an impressive rate.

Below, we walk through the historical FY2 P/E valuation metric for the key mega-cap names in our coverage universe. GOOGL has seen a meaningful re-rating in its valuation in 2H25 as it delivered an impressive beat in 3Q25 and successfully launched Gemini 3 to the top of LMArena. As a result, shares went from trading at a meaningful discount to the 10-year average of 21.5x to a meaningful premium, now trading at 28.5x. Exhibit 81 - GOOGL 10-Year FY2 P/E Valuation Source: BMO Capital Markets, FactSet META shares have been volatile in 2025, trading at both a premium and a discount during the year. We highlight that the 10-year average FY2 P/E valuation for META is 22x, and shares currently trade in-line with the 10-year average at 22x. Exhibit 82 - META 10-Year FY2 P/E Valuation Source: BMO Capital Markets, FactSet

AMZN shares continue to trade at a meaningful discount to the 5-year average FY2 P/E valuation, as investors continue to perceive AWS as behind on the AI opportunity. We highlight that valuation troughed earlier this year at ~22x, and shares now trade at ~29.5x, which is a meaningful discount to the 5-year average of 46x.

We believe the introduction of modern-day AI will bring about generational changes across every business and industry, as the integration of AI tools drives business efficiency and introduces new AIdriven product offerings. Broadly, we believe that over the long term, AI will help deliver both top-line revenue synergies and bottom-line efficiency through reduced variable costs and fixed-cost leverage. Notably, we expect AI to help unlock personalization at scale, helping companies to increasingly convert customers, likely with higher frequency and a lower customer acquisition cost. GOOGL and AMZN remain the best-positioned players in our coverage universe to benefit from AI -We strongly believe that GOOGL and AMZN are not only the best-positioned vendors in our coverage universe to win in AI over time, but we think they're also some of the clearest winners in any industry.

Notably, we highlight that their respective cloud units (GCP and AWS) are some of the most clear-cut ROI investments in the AI space, as investments (CapEx) into AI become immediately utilized in the cloud business as AI natives (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and others look to rent out access to GPU capacity to train models and run inference at scale. GOOGL AI Fears are Receding as Investors Realize GOOGL is an AI Winner -A core debate around GOOGL has focused on the proliferation of AI, and whether GOOGL was most at risk of AI-driven disruption, or if they are well-suited to benefit from the integration of AI.

For years now, bears have argued that GOOGL's crown jewel asset (Google Search) is at risk of AI-based disruption as users turn to AI chatbots (like ChatGPT) instead of searching on Google. While bears have pushed this narrative for well over 2 years, we have yet to find any evidence that this is true, as we perceive AI-based search to be more incremental to the core-search experience than cannibalistic. Said another way, we believe consumers are using generative AI-type search experiences for things they would never search for on Google or another search engine, creating an opportunity that is truly incremental rather than cannibalistic. Notably, we pulled DAU (Daily Active Users) data for Google, Gemini, and ChatGPT to compare user engagement across the three apps. The results were interesting, as they showed that the ChatGPT app has ~400M DAUs, meaningfully larger than the 60M DAUs that Gemini has scaled to.

However, we highlight that Google has over 2B DAUs in its app. While many perceive Gemini as a direct competitor to ChatGPT, we believe the integration of AI overviews into the core Google Search product makes Google a direct competitor to it.

- 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 Google ChatGPT Gemini Source: Sensortower, BMO Capital Markets To prove our thesis, we have conducted two consumer surveys on their search habits and how they might change over time. We ran our first survey of 1,000 consumers in August 2024 , and followed it up with a rerun in May 2025 to see how respondents' views had changed. The results were surprising (and clear): GOOGL users reported meaningful positive experiences with Google's AI overviews, with 49% reporting a positive experience vs 7% negative (and 44% neutral), implying a 42-point gap between those with a positive view and those with a negative view. Notably, users also suggested that AI overviews are leading them to click more links, with a 10-point gap between those who say AI overviews are making them click more and those who say they are making them click less.

Lastly, we were impressed by the comparison from our August 2024 survey versus our May 2025 survey, in which 85% of users called Google their primary search destination (up 200bps from August 2024), and a meaningful increase in the percentage of Google users who said they are unlikely to stop using Google search as their primary search engine. While bears will continue to say that Google is going to lose share in search, we highlight that our survey, as well as recent financial results, underscores our view that Google is actually best positioned to win in AI-related search, supported by: 1. Existing product leadership (Google); 2. AI product leadership.

As AI adoption continues to proliferate, several companies in our coverage universe have made disclosures (often one-off) that underscore the benefits they are seeing in AI.

During the 3Q earnings release, management gave the following stats related to their AI business: · As of 3Q25, AMZN had added 3.8GW of capacity over the LTM, and has doubled its capacity since 2022 · AMZN now plans to double the capacity again by the end of 2027, implying a 4x increase in capacity from 2022 to 2027 · Trainium2 is a multi-billion-dollar business, and grew 150% sequentially in 3Q25 · While the AWS backlog only grew 22% YoY in 3Q, management highlighted that they signed several large deals in October that were not included in the backlog number, and then signed the $38B OpenAI deal, suggesting AMZN could be set for a meaningful 4Q25E backlog number.

During the 3Q25 earnings release management provided the following stats related to their AI business: · GCP enterprise AI products are generating "billions in quarterly revenue. · GOOGL has signed more $1B+ cloud deals YTD (1Q25-3Q25) than they have in the last 2 years combined · Gemini App has over 650M MAUs (vs. 450M MAUs in 2Q25) as queries increased 3x sequentially. · Google has processed over 1.3 quadrillion monthly tokens, up 20x YoY. · Google also highlighted that its first-party models (such as Gemini) are currently processing 7B tokens per minute through its direct API, which is above the 6B tokens per minute that OpenAI recently reported at its second-ever OpenAI DevDay 2025 event, only a couple of weeks prior.

During the 3Q25 earnings release, management gave the following stats related to their AI business: · Advantage+ has scaled to a $60B ARR business · Lattice unified architecture: roll-out to app ads drove a roughly 3% increase in conversion. · Andromeda performance improvement: 14% increase in ad quality on Facebook surfaces was achieved by combining retrieval and early-stage ranking models. · Runtime model innovations: New ad ranking model in pilot saw a +2% increase in conversion on Instagram. · Recommendation system improvements: Surfacing 2x as many same-day published Reels vs. the start of the year. Instagram's expansion to broader topic diversity follows the success of the approach on Facebook and should continue to drive engagement.

Snapchat's AI disclosure is a bit more unique, as a company that is not actively investing in the AI opportunity. However, SNAP did announce one of the more unique AI integrations and partnerships we have seen thus far. · SNAP signed a 1-year deal with Perplexity, under which SNAP will integrate Perplexity's AIpowered answer engine into Snapchat, providing SNAP's ~1B MAUs with an AI-driven search experience directly integrated into the Snapchat app. ○ As a result, Perplexity will pay Snap $400M over one year (combination of cash and equity), with contributions beginning in 2026E.

Over the past year, we have written extensively on the ongoing hyperscaler CapEx cycle, which began in 2024 and will likely extend through at least 2027E. Google, Amazon, and Meta have all recently commented on the directional trajectory of their CapEx spend. Below we highlight some of the key commentary from management around each company's respective CapEx spend into 2026.

"With respect to CapEx, in the third quarter, our CapEx was $24 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in servers and 40% in data centers and networking equipment... We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're experiencing from Cloud customers as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company. We now expect CapEx to be in the range of $91 billion to $93 billion in 2025, up from our previous estimate of $85 billion keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability

Given management's guidance for a "significant increase in CapEx" in 2026E, we raised our FY26E CapEx estimate to $138B, which would represent a 48% increase from the $93B we expect GOOGL will spend in 2025E.

' Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $34.2 billion in Q3. We've now spent $89.9 billion so far this year. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI and core services and in custom silicon, like Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. We'll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI, as we believe it to be a massive opportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term . Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve. These investments will support growth for many years to come. Looking ahead, we expect our full year cash CapEx to be approximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase in 2026 " .

Following management's commentary we raised our FY26E CapEx estimate to $163B, which represents 30% growth from the $125B that AMZN guided to / that we expect they will spend in 2025E. Importantly, we highlight that AMZN has been leading the way on CapEx, and is spending more than any other hyperscaler to support the AI opportunity.

' We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases to be in the range of $70 billion to $72 billion, increased from our prior outlook of $66 billion to $72 billion...A central requirement to realizing these opportunities is infrastructure capacity. As we have begun to plan for next year, it's become clear that our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully, including versus our own expectations last quarter. We are still working through our capacity plans for next year, but we expect to invest aggressively to meet these needs, both by building our own infrastructure and contracting with third-party cloud providers. We anticipate this will provide further upward pressure on our CapEx and expense plans next year. As a result, our current expectation is that CapEx dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025" . As a result of management's commentary, we raised our FY26E CapEx estimate to $104B.

· Gen AI to improve predictive models and conversion rates Gen AI can incorporate unstructured data, generate synthetic data, and simulate possible business scenarios. · Retailers will leverage their 1P channels to increase engagement and reach. Video content and daily games will emerge as key engagement drivers for apps and websites.

· AI can help achieve high conversion rates by using advanced algorithms and smaller, more targeted customer data sets. · A/B tests should continue in 2025 to ensure accuracy and accountability in AI-driven marketing efforts. · Aggregating data from multiple departments -including legal, ethics, and data experts-can help ensure the successful implementation and responsible use of Gen AI across campaigns.

- · Scaling AI workloads to drive demand for compute and general purpose cloud: As AI apps proliferate and businesses and consumers increasingly leverage AI solutions, these will generate inference that goes to datacenters in the cloud, benefiting leading cloud providers like AWS, GCP and Azure.

- · AI will be the brains behind the next generation of robotics , helping companies to scale robotics offerings with increased intelligence that allows robotics to handle more tasks.

Digital Advertising Set to Grow to $870B Globally in 2026E: According to estimates from eMarketer, the digital advertising landscape is set to grow 11% in FY26E, to $870B. eMarketer's estimate implies a slight deceleration from 12.1% expected growth in 2025E, though could see possible benefits from AI driven advancements around ad creative and targeted that help incentivize advertisers

Source: eMarketer, BMO Capital Markets Three Players Control The Vast Majority of The Digital Advertising Market: While there are many players in the digital advertising ecosystem, we highlight that the industry is largely driven by 3 core players who comprise ~70% of the market, GOOGL (37%), META (25%) and AMZN (9%).

Google remains a Top Pick for us into 2026 as we believe they are best positioned in advertising as their broader AI leadership story unfold and regulatory overhands fade. We believe fears that search will be displaced by AI driven disintermediation have faded, as GOOGL displays AI product leadership that positions them well to lead the future of AI driven advertising. Importantly, we believe AI Overviews and AI Mode in the Search business are clearly resonating with consumers as adoption builds.

· Google AI Overviews have reached 2 billion monthly users use since launch in 1H24 setting up Search monetization in 2026 and beyond. · Since launch in May, AI Mode has scaled to 100M monthly users in US and India, and is likely to grow with product's roll-out to 200 new countries by end of the year. In addition to the global roll-out, a lift in usage is likely to benefit from the recent integration of agentic features. · Fading pressure from antitrust risk as GOOGL appears positioned for favorable remedy trial outcomes from both the search and ad tech antitrust trials.

U.S. Advertisers are expected to spend $69.3 billion (+18% YoY) on retail media in 2026E. Platforms with retail media networks are likely to benefit from higher lower-funnel ROAS through incremental sales. As these platforms have achieved growing reach and access to unique shopper data, Brand advertisers have also found the medium to be an effective tool for upper-funnel objectives. We believe intent is key for unlocking ROAS for both DR and Brand advertisers on Retail Media. Given this backdrop, Amazon is best positioned following Instacart, Uber, and DoorDash. Exhibit 92 - U.S. Retail Media Spend ($ in B) from 2024A to 2028E Source: BMO Capital Markets, eMarketer

The biggest challenge that Retail Media networks face is attribution across various platforms, which should improve in the next few years as the number of advertisers grows and collects insights. Further, AI should help improve the accuracy of measuring capabilities and speed of classification, that will enable advertisers, agencies, and brands to improve real-time campaign optimization. We believe Amazon and Instacart are best positioned for advertisers' adoption of Retail Media networks. These platforms have the best intent data across the grocery landscape, which should position them well for incremental ad budgets. Uber and DoorDash are also positioned well, given the frequency of use (i.e., daily/monthly usage for 3P Food Delivery versus 1-2x per year for Travel networks). However, we believe the capabilities are somewhat subdued relative to Amazon and Instacart. Exhibit 93 - Key Differences in Commerce Media Networks' Data and Audience Insights

We remain highly optimistic regarding CTV monetization over the next five years. For 2026E, we expect enhancements around CTV formats like QR code integrations and shoppable ads have helped transform CTV advertisements from brand spend to performance-driven ad spend, which helps to drive a more clear / measurable ROI for advertisers. As a user can now click a button on an Amazon CTV ad that allows them to add a product to their cart. As such, 2026E should prove to be the inflection year for meaningful CTV monetization as CTV ad spend growth (+18% YoY) continues while linear ad spend as a percentage of total media spend declines by -100bps YoY.

YouTube remains the leader in US engagement, and these trends should continue in 2026. We believe that YouTube is the best platform for Creators to expand their reach and monetize their content given short and long platform videos. As described in our number #4 prediction, YouTube Partner Program combined with new monetization capabilities for Shorts videos, should drive monetization for both on-device and CTV mediums. Netflix is the biggest beneficiary of linear TV dollars set to shift online globally. Given the company's growing AVOD subscribers and steady improvement in programmatic capabilities with The Trade Desk, Amazon DSP, and Google DV 360, we are confident Netflix should onboard a meaningful share of the $20-30 billion of linear TV dollars that likely flows online in the next three years.

We believe this number could prove to be conservative with the potential expansion of the company's ad load. One of our ad experts indicated that Netflix can increase its ad load to 12 minutes without seeing churn. We estimate Netflix's ad load is in the 3-5 minute range, leaving ample room for revenue growth. Linear TV Advertising Dollars Continue to Shift Towards CTV: We highlight that the ~$60B of linear TV ad spend in the U.S. continues to shift towards emerging CTV channel, which is expected to grow 14% YoY in the U.S. in 2026E to $37B. We believe we are still in the early-to-mid innings of this transition, as consumers (and advertisers) increasingly focus their TV efforts around streaming/CTV. NFLX remains the best positioned vendor to capitalize on this trend with their massive subscriber base and 190M Monthly Active Viewers (MAV).

The continued shift of sports streaming rights from linear TV to streamers are a core driver of rising CTV ad spend, as advertisers flock to ramping advertising businesses on CTV as a result of highly attractive sports rights. We highlight that sports content drives premium CPMs from advertisers while also exposing advertisers to the CTV ad opportunity and helps onboard these advertisers to the rest of their inventory. For perspective, premium sports-oriented inventory can demand $40 CPMs, which is above the premium SVOD inventory (such as Stranger Things) that typically demands $30 CPMs, and well above the FAST channels, which usually demand closer to $15 CPMs. Due to the increasing demand for live sports content on CTV, we anticipate that the blended CTV CPM will continue to rise over time. Source: BMO Capital Markets

Programmatic capabilities will underscore significant monetization improvement thanks to Trade Desk, Amazon DSPs, Microsoft, and Google DV360. NFLX's in-house tech was launched in Canada (4Q24), and its capabilities will continue to expand globally in 2026E with launch in 12 markets including the U.K., Germany and Japan. Recently announced NFLX/AMZN partnerships allows advertisers purchasing ads through Amazon to access NFLX's premium ad inventory. For NFLX, the partnership brings more programmatic ad buyers onto its ramping ad business, helping to close the monetization gap with SVOD. Encouragingly, management also highlighted that they are seeing faster growth in programmatic advertising, which they expect will become an increasing part of the incremental revenue contribution in the future.

Amazon remains our Top Pick across our eCommerce coverage given its leadership position in SameDay/Next-Day delivery as well as expanding selection of 1P/3P products. Speed (time from checkout to delivery) remains high in importance to consumers and continues to impact conversion rates for sellers across categories. Against that, Amazon continues executing successfully against its regionalization strategy, which began in 2023, to focus on inbound placement of products and expedite delivery speed across its regional network for both Amazon.com and off-platform purchases.

That said, recent economic headwinds are changing consumer shopping patterns and value/affordability is gaining higher importance for consumers. In response to a softening macro backdrop, we see all income groups adopting a value-first playbook - making more frequent trips with smaller baskets and embracing private label brands, with retailers like Walmart seeing grocery private brand penetration rise 60 basis points year-over-year. Lower- and middle-income households are aggressively cutting discretionary spending and relying heavily on discounters and extreme value programs, while highincome consumers maintain premium purchases but increasingly shop through value-focused retailers. Consumer spending is shifting toward essentials, with retail food and beverage dollars rising while discretionary general merchandise declining, and grocers reporting significant trade-down within categories.

As high prices remain a major concern for consumers and inflation pressure, moderating but still elevated, seems unlikely to dissipate any time soon, we expect consumers to become extremely valueoriented in 2026. As a result, retailers offering competitive pricing should see an opportunity to gain share of wallet. Against such a backdrop, we expect Amazon to fare quite well given its price advantage, sustained for nine years in a row, on top of its leadership in expedited delivery and product selection. According to the latest annual Price Wars study by Profitero+, Amazon remains the ultimate leader in all 16 categories (covering over 10,000 items) across 23 leading retailers. The study, conducted in July through September 2025, shows that Amazon maintained its pricing lead in 2025, with an average price advantage of 14% over competitors , on par with 14% advantage in 2024. Other key takeaways from the Profitero+ study include:

· Amazon increased its price advantage in Toys & Games from 10% to 13% · Walmart narrowed its price gap from 5% to 4% ○ With improvements across 10 of the 16 categories analyzed - most notably in Video Games, where the gap shrank from 12% to just 3% · Target maintained last year's improvement, holding steady at prices 13% higher than Amazon's · Wayfair narrowed its price gap from 17% to 11% We expect Amazon's competitive pricing to provide a critical competitive advantage in a macro environment with elevated inflation expectations and softening labor market.

As of late 2025, Amazon has significantly expanded its logistics capabilities, transforming its set of supply chain services into a comprehensive utility (called Supply Chain by Amazon) for third-party merchants. It offers a fully-automated suite of end-to-end supply chain services that allow merchants to get their products from manufacturers to customers around the world, with Amazon picking up inventory from their suppliers' manufacturing facilities, shipping it across borders, handling customs clearance and ground transportation, storing inventory in bulk, managing replenishment across Amazon and other sales channels, and delivering directly to customers. Exhibit 98 - How Supply Chain by Amazon Works Source: Amazon

A part of that set, Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD) has evolved into a global service (GWD - Global Warehousing and Distribution), enabling upstream bulk storage near manufacturing hubs. Simultaneously, Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) has broadened Amazon's reach to support major external platforms, including Walmart, Shopify, eBay, and SHEIN, positioning the company's logistics network as a back-end solution for the broader eCommerce ecosystem.

With off-platform purchases becoming an important element of Amazon's retail business (discussed here ), AWD/GWD and MCF unlock significant opportunities for sellers to increase conversion and drive sales growth. The company is seeing tangible gains, with merchants using MCF for off-Amazon channels reporting a 19% average increase in sales along with a 19% reduction in out-of-stock rates and a 12% improvement in inventory turnover (as of Sep '25). MCF is available in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, five European countries, Japan, India, and Australia. Amazon has reported that its logistics services support over 600,000 sellers worldwide who move over 5 billion items annually through its network. Exhibit 99 - Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfilment Flow Source: Amazon

During Amazon's 3Q25 earnings call, management mentioned that the company's regionalized network is operating at scale, but they continue to fine-tune and improve fulfillment operations. As a result, U.S. inbound lead time has declined by nearly four days compared to 2024, with a positive impact on working capital. In addition, by placing inventory more strategically throughout the network, Amazon can offer U.S. customers the ability to order perishable groceries and receive them the same day in as little as five hours. The company is seeing positive early results since launching in January, with customers visiting the site more often and returning twice as often as non-perishable shoppers. Amazon plans to continue investing in smaller Same-Day buildings in the coming years. These buildings require lower incremental CapEx than the large-scale fulfillment centers built during the pandemic. As a result, delivery speed should increase, which will improve customer experience levels and, combined, create a positive multi-year FCF unlock on the retail business.

Social commerce allows shoppers to discover and purchase products directly on their social media feeds. It gained rapid traction in China, given early investments by Alibaba and JD.com, reinforced by consumer behavior that skews more mobile than in other regions. While the U.S. has been somewhat slow to adopt these shopping trends, social commerce continues to gain share relative to overall eCommerce sales in the country. Social commerce adoption is expected to continue over the next several years, as the average user interacts with around 6.8 platforms monthly and roughly 58% of U.S. shoppers have purchased a product they saw on social media, according to industry estimates. Specifically, MCF on TikTok has improved peak orders for certain sellers by 15x, given its attractive click-to-delivery speed and better than 97% on-time delivery rates.

That said, industry estimates for 2026E and beyond have barely budged over the past year, given ongoing macro uncertainty and persistent pricing pressure across practically all verticals. Further, social commerce adoption in the U.S. remains well below APAC, mainly owing to consumer shopping preferences, which favor delivery speed in the U.S. That said, Amazon fulfillment should help unlock social commerce demand as consumers are provided with greater selection and faster delivery speeds relative to the current offering.

The Home Furnishings category, cyclical and closely tied to the housing market, is also quite big estimated at roughly $500 billion in Wayfair's four markets: the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Ireland. And although the cyclical trough would be hard to pinpoint, management is already seeing signs of industry's negative growth turning flattish in 2025. Recall that in 2021, consumers were flush with cash and quarantined at home, which resulted in a step function increase in home remodeling - both large and small projects. As a result, the post-pandemic decline had lasted for over two years and just now management is seeing some sustainable improvement. This uptrend, however, is overlapping with an economy that feels rather uncertain and showing signs of softening. Ultimately, it's hard to predict which way consumer spend on furnishings would go, but we continue to view Wayfair as the industry leader, positioned well to gain market share in any macro

environment. We also like the fact that Wayfair has made progress in 2025 on providing better value to consumers, as reflected in Profitero+'s Price Wars study (6 pts improvement from 2024). That said, CastleGate continues to prove effective, reaching 97% of U.S. consumers in under two days and removing purchase friction between Wayfair's over 20,000 suppliers and 22 million buyers. Further, about 20% of the company's employees are technologists, extending Wayfair's leadership position as online penetration in Home Furnishings continues to grow relative to overall spending. AI and machine learning are at the center of the Wayfair platform. The R&D teams continue to be led by Co-Founder Steven Conine. The R&D teams have built a highly complex and impressive technology stack that includes image quality models, product matching capabilities, programmatic bids across digital ad formats to maximize ROAS, and its end-to-end shipping solution for suppliers and customers.

With 200,000 new products added to Wayfair each quarter, the likelihood that the right product is served to the right shopper increases with the proliferation of AI. Exhibit 102 - Wayfair's Predicted Winners Machine Learning Models Source: BMO Capital Markets, Wayfair

With respect to tariffs, management has shared that there wasn't a significant pull forward of demand, except for a couple of pockets of time. And the pull forward had been in very specific categories and just measured in days. On the balance, tariffs have had a minimal effect so far and management does not think tariffs have driven consumer behavior into pulled-forward purchases. As for the impact from raised tariffs on product pricing, management has shared that a lot of the tariffrelated cost increases had been absorbed by suppliers, willing to take lower margins on their existing product lines or offset by transportation cost buffers built into quoted prices. However, management expects new product lines to get introduced at higher price points (adjusted to offset higher tariffs) introducing more inflation down the road.

From a macro perspective, the most important factors for the Home Furnishings category remain the health of the housing market, the overall health of the economy, consumers' wage situation, and consumer sentiment. Unfortunately, only one of these four factors looks encouraging today - growth in real wages - but only for those that already have a job. We expect Wayfair to continue gaining wallet share in the category given the large and growing addressable market opportunity. With an annual customer spend of roughly $550 on Wayfair, the share of wallet opportunity remains significant, given average household spend on the category at around $3,000. Category sales in 2025 are notably well above pre-pandemic levels and average growth through September (the latest reported month due to the government shutdown) is notably above YoY growth in 2023 and 2024. We don't have visibility into the holiday shopping period, but we also don't expect material divergence from trends earlier in the year.

Focus category growth has been accelerating five quarters in a row and has helped eBay get really close to achieving its goal of mid-single-digit Marketplace GMV growth for the year. Over time, eBay expects roughly 50% of GMV will come from its focus categories, up from about 25% at the end of 2022. Parts & Accessories (P&A) remains the largest focus category, with over 750 million live listings, and the second-largest contributor to growth in 3Q25. Collectibles, for second quarter in a row, contributed the most to growth in the quarter, driven by accelerating growth in trading cards. Fashion (including luxury, streetwear and apparel) remains another major contributor, followed by all other focus categories. We think eBay's targeted full-funnel marketing approach, focused on enthusiasts in focus categories, has been paying off with improved return on ad spend. 25% Exhibit 104 - Focus Categories vs. Marketplace GMV Growth Source: BMO Capital Markets, eBay

As consumers adjust purchase behavior in response to softening macro and stagnated labor market, we expect to see increasing traffic to eBay's platform and corresponding growth of GMV, given eBay's strong value proposition. And with middle- and high-income consumers trading down too, we expect to see incremental tailwinds to most of eBay's major categories including Fashion, Handbags, Watches, Refurbished Electronics, and Parts & Accessories.

Parts & Accessories is eBay's largest focus category (750 million live listings and GMV in excess of $10 billion), with durable growth in the MSD range. The company continues introducing features to enhance the customer experience, including the critical Guaranteed Fit, which guarantees auto parts will correctly fit or shopper gets their money back . We note that this program was launched in the UK and Germany in September 2023, following its successful roll-out in the U.S. seven months earlier. The program leverages over 5 billion pieces of incremental fitment data to ensure consumers get the right part they need, thus establishing critical trust in the category, along with free and easy returns (flexible 30-day return window, free shipping labels, accelerated refund processing). Not surprisingly, eBay has reported double-digit increase in conversions on these listings.

Collectibles is another eBay category in excess of $10 billion with appealing growth outlook and a full-funnel business across all price points, following the relatively recent acquisitions of TCGplayer and Goldin. The former is a low- to mid-ASP collectible-cards business that effectively connects enthusiasts with like-minded communities and improves the overall online experience for the category. In May 2024, eBay acquired Goldin, which auctions high-value trading cards and collectibles, and has been integrating its inventory directly into the eBay marketplace to enhance the overall value for enthusiasts. Authentication is a key component of focus category growth as it significantly improves crosssell opportunities on the platform. This includes investments in vehicle compatibility for P&A, luxury authentication, and 20-day free returns.

eBay is one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI The company has invested in AI for many years across the business to improve both buyer and seller experience. eBay has achieved significant AI adoption with over 10 million sellers using AI tools to create over 300 million listings at a rate of roughly 500,000 new AI-generated listings per day, fundamentally transforming the listing creation process. In 2024, the company upgraded its Gen AI capabilities by increasing its GPU capacity, deploying its first supercomputer, improving hardware utilization, and developing architectures optimized for LLMs. The enhanced AI platform enabled eBay to build and run models approximately 100 times larger than the prior year. We believe eBay is well-positioned to benefit further from its Gen AI tools and products.

With high prices a key concern for consumers, we believe that value would trump selection and speed in 2026, but the latter two remain important. Nevertheless, Amazon maintains a competitive advantage across all three of these dimensions and remains our top pick in eCommerce.

We like Amazon because of its leading position in AI/Cloud, retail media/advertising, and retail in the U.S. and globally . AWS is the market share leader with roughly 50% of public cloud spend and is best positioned to benefit from the exploding demand for Cloud capacity for AI workloads. We believe AWS is among the leaders in the foundational and middle layers of the Gen AI/ML stack. With the proliferation of Gen AI workloads, AWS growth accelerated in 3Q25 and we model further acceleration through 1H26E. Advertising is now a $70B+ run-rate business which further supports Amazon's flywheel, with upside to estimates given secular and idiosyncratic tailwinds. We believe the ongoing roll-out of expedited delivery infrastructure with lower CapEx vs. fulfillment centers is both improving the customer experience and unlocking Retail FCF in 2026 and onward.

We also like eBay given 1) the acceleration in focus categories, 2) adoption of BNPL driving higher AOV carts and younger customers, 3) solid and improving profitability, 4) ad revenue acceleration, 5) Active Buyer base returning to platform, and 6) easing competitive pressure from Temu/Shein. We are keeping an eye on ongoing tariff and macro uncertainties and lapping substantial trading card growth in 4Q25. Our view is that Wayfair remains well-positioned longer term, but we await more near-term signals that indicate the Home Furnishings category is on firmer footing . We like that management is executing well, delivering strong financial performance and KPIs. We expect improvements in price and selection to drive top-line growth in 2026E while lapping restructuring efforts should support margin expansion. We also like ongoing investments to capture share of $500 billion TAM. Still, cyclical headwinds outweigh attractive secular growth for now, and we remain on the sidelines.

Industry Growth Remains Subdued Following COVID-19 Driven Boost Following strong growth in the video game industry from: 1) The rise of the Battle Royale genre; 2) COVID-19 driven growth (2020-2021), the industry has returned to a low-single-digit growth outlook as investors question what the next major catalyst to the gaming space will be. According to NewZoo, the video game industry is set to grow at a 3.1% 4-Year CAGR ('24-28E), representing a bleak outlook for industry growth and underscoring the maturity of the industry following decades of meaningful growth stages like the rise of digital downloads, microstransactions, Battle Royale, and COVID-19 (among others).

While Industry Growth is Slow, The Largest Publishers Continue to Gain Share While NewZoo estimates suggest that the video game industry will only grow at a 3.1% CAGR (2024-2028E), we highlight that the largest video game companies are set to grow meaningfully faster as the biggest franchises continue to gain share. For perspective, consensus estimates imply that TTWO, RBLX and EA grow at a 3-year CAGR of 13%, 21% and 5% respectively, underscoring how the largest publishers are positioned to gain share against a gaming ecosystem only growing at a 3.1% CAGR. Additionally, we believe the generational-event launch of GTA VI could possibly serve as a positive catalyst to the entire gaming ecosystem (over time) by driving a meaningful improvement in the installation base, which ultimately allows all publishers to sell more games to consumers. We also believe GTA VI is likely to include some transformational gameplay that could support faster industry growth.

We see the rise of UGC as the next core catalyst to the video game space, as developers look to adopt user-generated-content that helps to shift the risk of game development onto individual developers, allowing game developers to benefit from the upside, while removing the risk of creating games that fail to resonate with consumers. We note that the rise of UGC corresponds at a similar time in the gaming industry in which the biggest companies have meaningfully pulled back on investments behind new intellectual property, as the risks of creating a game that fail to resonate with consumers continues to grow.

While UGC has been around for decades (think custom game modes in Halo and other large AAA games), we highlight that Roblox has helped to put the financial opportunity of UGC on the radar of every game development company. Roblox operates a platform of games that are completely user generated, as RBLX's core job is to invest and build tools that allow users to develop their own games on the platform. As a result, RBLX has scaled a massive platform where over 5M developers on the platform earn some kind of revenue, and 150M+ DAUs flock to the platform on a daily basis to gain access to millions of free games. Exhibit 108 - Breakdown of Roblox Developer and Creator Rewards in 2023 Source: Roblox While Roblox has an early lead in the UGC opportunity, we highlight that competition is ramping quickly, and we expect large publishers like EA and TTWO are likely to go after the opportunity following the explosive growth that they have observed by RBLX.

We have been writing about the meaningful push that Epic Games has been making in UGC, using their existing Fortnite platform as a key driver of their UGC ambitions. Specifically, Epic Games / Fortnite has made 2 specific announce: · Announced meaningful increases in UGC creator revenue share for 2026 · Partnered with Unity to bring games created on Unity into the Fortnite UGC ecosystem While competition in the UGC space is increasing, we believe the addressable market opportunity is massive, and that there is room for multiple winners who in turn can use the opportunity to drive faster revenue growth for the broader gaming industry. Importantly, the proliferation of UGC could help to improve the broader margin structure of public video game companies by eliminating the hit / bust risk of new game development and offloading that risk to smaller individual user / private UGC game platforms, allowing AAA game publisher to benefit from the hit games without taking the risk on new IP development.

Anticipate continued consolidation in the video game space. While we expect consolidation will be a broader trend among the tech space, we believe the video game industry is likely ripe for continued consolidation and acquisitions. We remind investors of MSFT's massive $69B acquisition of Activision announced in 2022. Following that acquisition, there was not a ton of transactions in the gaming space, until a consortium of investors made the largest ever leveraged-buyout (LBO) of EA for $55B. Following this transaction, we believe more assets in the space are likely to consolidate, and believe that TTWO could be a target for strategic players peripherally in the space like AMZN, GOOGL and NFLX, who are large companies that can absorb a transaction of that size who have shown intense interest to be in the video game space. We believe RBLX could be a potential roll-up story, as they continue to build out their capabilities to support a UGC game environment at scale.

Expect Industry Growth to Be Driven by Biggest Games Getting Bigger as Investment Into New IP Remains Subdued: We anticipate that much of the low-single-digit growth in the gaming industry will be driven by the largest games in the world, as those games continue to gain share of the ~$190B global video game market. Notably, we believe publishers will continue to shy away from development of new IP, which presents meaningful risk to publishers if said new IP fails to resonate with consumers upon launching.

giving them a larger install base to sell into. A key component to understanding video game sales is understanding the console cycle. Consoles go through multi-year cycles in which the core hardware developers (Sony and Microsft) release a new generation of hardware every 5-7 years. We highlight that as it gets later in the console cycle, publishers tend to benefit from a larger install base of gamer on the latest iteration of hardware. For example, the current hardware cycle began in 2020, in which 8M units of net-gen hardware solid, which had headwinds from mid-year launch and COVID-19 driven supply chain disruptions. Notably, that install base has grown by 20M+ annually, and we expect to end 2025 with ~130M consoles in the install base.

We expect that the upcoming mega launch of GTA VI in November 2026 will serve as a positive catalyst to the broader video game industry by helping to accelerate console sales as consumers look to purchase the newest hardware to play the biggest video game launch of all time. Notably, we expect this to be supported by the game reactivating prior gamers who have left the ecosystem but have been awaiting to return on the GTA VI launch.

Source: BMO Capital Markets, Circana Jumping From One Platform to the Next: Cross-Platform, Device Play, & Revisiting Handheld Consoles New Portable / on-the-go Consoles Could Support Growth: On-the-go gaming devices are seeing improved capabilities with each generation, and increased focus and investment by players like Nintendo, Xbox, Sony and Valve could help drive continued improvements and growth in portable gaming. Lines are blurring between mobile, console, and PC gaming as cross-platform gameplay and handheld have taken off due to technological advances in the industry. Cross-platform play allows players to log into their gaming accounts on every device and play and socialize with friends regardless of their chosen device.

The launch of iPhone Pro 15 allowed users to play *some* AAA console games on their mobile devices. This impressive technological feat continues to advance as players have commented that the launch of the iPhone 16 Pro has even better frame rates than the iPhone 15. While the experience and tech fall below that of a console, we think this represents the start of a potential step up in growth for the industry from user expansion. These trends are hugely beneficial for the biggest AAA game franchises. Globally, gamers have a voracious appetite for the biggest AAA gaming brands, even if they offer a different experience from the core game. This also supports our thesis that big publishers will continue to gain more market shares given the network effect and ability to invest more in technology for cross-platform gaming. Of our covered names, EA's various sports franchises and RBLX have found success by embracing new business models (ads, subscription, free-to-play) and platforms (mobile and PC).

· Four EA Sports FC games are under the franchise umbrella: EA Sports FC, EA Sports FC Online, EA Sports FC Ultimate Team, and EA Sports FC Mobile, which will bring the EA Sports brand to a massmarket, global audience. · RBLX allows users to play and interact across multiple platforms. The game initially launched on PC (2006) and moved into cross-platform gaming, with mobile launches with iOS (2006) and Android (2014), and then console Xbox (2015) and PS4 (2023). The cross-platform/cross-device play line has become increasingly blurred as both MSFT's Xbox and SONY have launched their own handheld console devices this year - which was one of our predictions for 2025. Both handhelds do not have true cross-platform play capabilities but the ROG XBox Ally has some crossplatform features on select games.

· Xbox has partnered with ASUS ROG to create the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, which are handheld gaming devices that offer a full Xbox experience on a Windows 11 operating system. The devices provide access to Xbox Game Pass and PC games, with features like automatic save syncing across devices. · Sony has released several handheld gaming devices, including the PocketStation, various PlayStation Portable (PSP) models, the PlayStation Vita, and most recently, the PlayStation Portal. The PlayStation Portal is a handheld streaming device that allows users to play PS5 games over Wi-Fi, and with recent updates, can also function as a standalone cloud streaming device with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. There is also speculation regarding a new, more powerful Sony handheld, code named "Project Canis," potentially launching around 2027.

With the launch of the aforementioned handhelds, both companies would be competing against Nintendo's Switch which has sold 152.3M units since launch in 2017 more than the 84.2M for PS5 and 33.7M for the Series X and S. Both MSFT and Sony handhelds are in the early stages but are getting to closer to cross-platform capabilities. Sony's ambition is to have its handheld device play PS5 games without an active WiFi connection, and we think it is reasonable to assume that Microsoft has plans for similar gaming capabilities. Both console companies have noted that the products remain a few years out, and we expect the devices in 2027E with the expected new console launch. Given the potential disruption, we will be monitoring the updates around this in 2026 closely.

We remain bullish and expect this to drive significant growth across the industry given that 1) handheld devices require less equipment than a console (no TV needed), 2) will likely become more affordable and expand reach, and 3) increase time spent gaming as players will be able to play anywhere.

TTWO (Top-Pick) is the best-positioned publisher with the Mega-Launch of GTA VI in November 2026E. TTWO remains our top pick in the video game space (again) into 2026, as we see the launch of GTA VI on November 19, 2026 as possibly the biggest event in video game history. For background, the lunch of GTA VI has now been delayed multiple times, previously planning to release in Fall 2025, the game was later delayed to May 26, 2026. However, in November, TTWO announced that they would delay the game by another 6 months, with a new release date of November 19, 2026. We believe GTA VI is likely to release on its current launch date, as the Rockstar team has now had another year of development, which we believe helps to underscore the massive transformational gaming experience that the team is building, that will underscore the next decade of growth for TTWO. We have written extensively about our expectations for GTA VI, including our GTA VI deep dive where we highlighted our assumption that the game will sell 45M units in its launch window.

Though Outside of GTA VI, TTWO has an Attractive Pipeline: While TTWO's pipeline is headlined by the mega-launch of GTA VI, we highlight that their broader pipeline remains highly attractive, including the Launch of Judas. Project ETHOS and the next iteration in the BioShock franchise. We believe TTWO's attractive pipeline of mostly owned IP positions them well to drive value for shareholders.

GTA VI Delay Driven Sell-Offs Create a Buying Opportunity: As we have stated previously, we strongly view any sell-offs in TTWO's stock from announcements that GTA VI is delayed as meaningful opportunities to buy the stock. Ultimately, we believe game delays have minimal to no impact on the underlying success of a game, and highlight only minimal impacts to our DCF. As a result, we continue to encourage investors to purchase TTWO's stock if it declines from GTA VI delays. However, we anticipate that GTA VI will now lunch on its currently launch date of 11/19/26.

GTA VI will launch and sell 45M units in its launch window in 2026/2027, ultimately becoming the highest-grossing video game title of all time. On 12/5/24, we published our GTA VI deep dive report, outlining our expectations for GTA VI while looking back at prior iterations of GTA V as a guidepost. In our analysis, we assume that GTA VI will sell 45M units in its launch window, which implies that ~30% of the ~150M current gen consoles purchase the game in the launch window. Importantly, we remind investors that the Grand Theft Auto franchise is one of the biggest IPs in all of entertainment, having sold 460M lifetime units.

BMO's Proprietary Video Game Survey Supports GTA VI as the Most Anticipated Game: We ran a proprietary survey on June 16, 2025 to 750 U.S. consumers who play video games to gauge their purchase intent in the gaming space. The results of the survey were most positive for TTWO, as respondents were overwhelmingly positive on their purchase intent for GTA VI. Encourangly, given a list of the biggest upcoming games, 36% of consumers called GTA VI the release that they were most excited about, and 92% of consumers said they were likely to purchase GTA VI, above the 91% who reported having purchased a GTA game in their lifetime.

RBLX was one of the best-performing names in our coverage universe in 2025, with shares up 63% YTD (as of 12/10/25) supported by a step function change in platform engagement. We believe key unlocks around search and discovery were the primary driver, which led to multiple new games on the platform scaling in ways never seen before on Roblox, or gaming, as multiple Roblox games ( Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot) broke all time video game current user records (which were previously held by Fortnite). Earlier in 2025, RBLX would see peak concurrent users of ~10M in any given week; however, these unlocks helped to drive an all-time high of 42.6M concurrent users on the platform, which has maintained in the mid-low-30M concurrent user range since.

However, we highlight that peak concurrent users have begun to fade following a multi-quarter period of meaningfully ramping engagement. Specifically, we note that the weekly peak concurrent user count (typically Saturdays) has declined WoW for 8 straight weeks, falling from 37.0M to 29.7M in the most recent week. We are closely monitoring to see when RBLX peak CCUs may find a floor to build off of again, but we remain confident that RBLX will return to setting engagement records again in the future.

The Biggest Games on The Platform are Changing: Grow a Garden was the original breakout hit game on RBLX, which reached 474M visits on a single day in August. While Grow a Garden was the initial spark that set the platform on fire, we highlight the game has become a fraction of what it was previously, and currently only generated ~20M visits per day, which is down meaningful from its peak of 474M. However, as Grow a Garden visitation has faltered, other games like Steal a Brainrot and 99 Nights in The Forest have taken its place, helping to support continued strength in the platform. Importantly, we believe the recent increase in engagement is driven by key unlocks around broader search and discovery on Roblox rather than the creation of any specific hit games. Because of this dynamic, we expect many more games will take the platform by storm in the coming years. Exhibit 121 - Daily Visits (in M) To Grow a Garden Source: Romonitorstats, BMO Capital Markets

· How durable is the recent engagement bump? · How will age verification initiatives and ensuing player segmentation impact player engagement? · How impactful will ramping competition from competitors (like Fortnite) be to RBLX's growth? · How quickly can RBLX ramp a meaningful advertising business?

Advertising is Immaterial Today, But we Think it Could be a Meaningful Business Over Time: While RBLX's advertising business remains an insignificant business today, we highlight the business is still early in its ramp. Importantly, we highlight that RBLX's MASSIVE user base of 152M DAUs provides the meaningful building blocks to support a scaled ad business over time. For perspective, while RBLX's 152M DAUS is dwarfed by SNAP's 477M, it is also meaningfully larger than RDDT's 116M DAUs. Importantly, RBLX's DAUs are growing fast, and the age up thesis makes the vast majority of users on the platform addressable to the advertising opportunity. Importantly for RBLX vs RDDT/SNAP, advertising would be an ancillary business to RBLX, rather than a core driver of the fundamental story, making it an attractive "call-option" on the broader gaming opportunity. We also believe RBLX's ability to use advertising to drive rewards for users creates an intriguing value prop vs

other platforms. Exhibit 125 - DAUs by Platform Source: BMO Capital Markets, Company Reports

With 78% of Roblox players indicating that they would purchase a real world item that was advertised to them on Roblox. We believe this helps to underscore the value that Roblox could provide to advertisers, as leaned in daily active users at scale indicate that ads on the platform could actually impact their purchasing decisions.

Q: "How likely would you be to purchase a physical / real world product that was advertised to you on Roblox?" n=418 Source: BMO Capital Markets June 2025 Survey RBLX's Mobile Centric Platform is Ripe for Ad Format: We highlight that 80% of RBLX's DAUs play the game from a mobile device, which is a format that is already well conditioned and built for serving ads on. We believe this will serve as a meaningful advantage as RBLX looks to build out an ad business, which we believe can scale with both video and display advertising.

EA Acquisition to Close in 2026E Following the $55B leveraged buyout of EA by a consortium of investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silverlake and Affinity Partners we expect the transaction will ultimately close in 2Q26E, bringing EA into the private markets. We believe EA enters the private market with strength on the heels of a successful Battlefield 6 launch. However, we question if a leverage buyout, which will saddle the company with a heavy debt service payment, is the optimal way for this asset to grow. We believe the debt burden could possibly limit EA's ability to invest in new franchises.

Ubisoft has Steadied The Boat and is Looking to Get Back on Track in 2026E Following a tough few years for UBI, we believe they have the foundation in place to build off of, largely supported by the closing of a €1.16B investment by Tencent that gives them a 26.32% ownership of Vantage Studios. As a result, UBI will be able to pay down debt and lower its leverage ratio, as they further invest into their largest IP to drive a return to revenue growth following a transition year in calendar 2025.

The rise of prediction markets (Kalshi, Polymarket, etc.) in the U.S. has changed the U.S. sportsbetting landscape and essentially made sportsbetting accessible at a federal level in all 50 states through the introduction of "event contracts" that are regulated by the CFTC. As a result of the rise of prediction markets, DKNG ended up acquiring a CFTC licensed exhange (Railbird) which sets the stage for them to launch their own prediction market in December 2025. However, shortly after this acquisition, a Judge in Nevada removed a prior injunction that will now allow the states to enforce a ban on prediction markets in the state, presenting a major legal win for legal OSB operators and states that collect tax revenue from them. We ultimately believe the legality of prediction markets will eventually come down to a U.S. Supreme Court decision.

· Prediction Market competition · NBA/MLB Betting Scandals · Unfavorable Sports Outcomes · Higher state taxes on iGaming/OSB operations The Fate of Prediction Markets Remains Unclear: While prediction markets have taken the country by storm, we believe the future of prediction markets in the U.S. remain somewhat unclear. In our view, prediction markets are a clear backdoor to sportsbetting, in which users are able to bet on sports through "event contracts" that are regulated at the federal level through the CFTC rather than regulated at the state level like traditional online sports betting. While Kalshi and prediction markets caught some initial courtroom victories, a key ruling from a Judge in Nevada in late November brings into question the legality of sports prediction markets. Ultimately, we suspect the supreme court will make a ruling on legality of prediction markets.

We see DKNG as well-positioned to be a long-term winner in the U.S. OSB/iGaming market. The U.S. Sports betting market is currently dominated by two key players: DKNG and FLUT (Fanduel), who control the vast majority of the U.S. market. Several vendors, including Fanatics, ESPN Bet, Bet MGM, etc., are fighting for market share. We see DKNG as well-positioned, given its best-in-class technology, early mover advantage, and brand recognition, which we expect will help DKNG to retain a meaningful share in the industry. We highlight that the TAM in North America alone is significant, and is expected to grow to $63B in 2030 (per Flutter) with a $39B OSB TAM, and a $24B iGaming TAM.

Source: Visible Alpha, BMO Capital Markets Accelerated State OSB Legalization Will Come: We strongly anticipate that states will increasingly look to legalize OSB in 2026E/2027E as the rise of prediction markets leads states to legalize, regulate and tax state gaming partners like DKNG and FLUT (Not covered). Since prediction markets are regulated at the federal level, they avoid paying taxes to states for gaming related revenues like traditional OSB operators do. As a result, as prediction markets essentially provide a backdoor to online sports betting, we believe states will look to legalize OSB so that the states can generate tax revenue from the sports betting activity that is already going on in their state through prediction markets.

Key states remain offline, including Texas and California. We highlight that the legalization and launch of sportsbetting in Missouri on 12/1/25 made it the 29th state in which DKNG had OSB operations. However, while the majority of states have now legalized, we highlight that large states like Texas, California and Florida remain inaccessible to key operators like DraftKings and FanDuel. While these large states remain offline, we highlight that OSB is legal in Florida, but the Seminole tribe has an essential monopoly until 2051 through a legal ruling. Additionally, we suspect that California's eventual legalization is likely to place the economic opportunity within the local tribe's power. This leaves Texas as a key state for investors to monitor from an OSB legalization front over the coming years, though we highlight there are still roadblocks to legalization in Texas.

iGaming is Still in its Infancy. While OSB has been legalized in over half of the 50 U.S. states, we highlight that iGaming (traditional luck based casino games) has only been legalized in 7 states. We believe much of the opportunity in legalization remains in iGaming, with large states like NY, who has legal OSB, still offline from an iGaming perspective.

support. We highlight that the sports betting / iGaming operators (DKNG/FLUT) are still early in their ramp as meaningful FCF stories. We believe DKNG is set to meaningfully grow its FCF and FCF margin over the next few years, however, rising state taxes and prediction market threats present key risks to this thesis. However, we believe if DKNG is able to operate through these headwinds, that the FCF ramp will provide meaningful valuation support as investors are able to back up the truck on attractive FCF yields.

Indications That Tech Is Steadily Unlocking $1.7T Online Grocery TAM 3P food delivery growth continues at a low-teens annual rate as expanding supply optionality produces incremental frequency among existing users while new user growth remains attractive. Further, couriers/drivers continue to seek incremental income given the inflationary environment, which improves overall ETA for consumers and limits the potential for cost deleverage in 2026E. We are seeing continued progress among online delivery platforms to increase the cost-effective adoption of online grocery. Notably, 1) platforms have reduced the cost to serve groceries, 2) selection continues to expand, and 3) the user experience is improving. According to industry estimates, grocery sales in the U.S. will be just under $1.7 trillion in 2026E, with digital representing just 14% and rising to 16% by 2029E. We believe recent supply and demand initiatives could accelerate online adoption in the coming years.

By mid-August, the company had scaled the service to Prime members across over 1,000 U.S. cities, and by mid-December it expanded to over 2,300 cities and towns, with plans for additional expansion in 2026. · Amazon's grocery integration is driving strong customer interest, with 70% of perishables customers being first-time Amazon grocery shoppers and those purchasing fresh items returning to shop twice as often as non-perishables customers. · In early December 2025, Amazon also started a pilot for ultra-fast 30-minute Delivery service in select areas of Seattle and Philadelphia. The new service, branded Amazon Now, is integrated into the existing Amazon shopping app and website for customers in eligible ZIP codes. Customers can choose from thousands of household essentials and fresh grocery items, including milk, produce, electronics, and over-the-counter medicines.

· In October 2025, Instacart partnered with Grubhub to offer grocery delivery services across the U.S. to customers on Grubhub and Seamless. Later, in November, Instacart announced a partnership with Airbnb (starting in January 2026) to allow guests to order groceries on Instacart through the Airbnb app and website during their Airbnb stay in select cities. Also in November, the company introduced AI Solutions - a suite of AI tools for grocers including Agentic Commerce and Cart Assistant, with launch partners including Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.

· In early December 2025, Instacart launched a shopping app on ChatGPT becoming the first grocery partner to offer embedded, end-to-end shopping and Instant Checkout. The new integration makes it easier than ever for people to go from meal inspiration to doorstep delivery, using Instacart's real-time grocery network and fulfillment capabilities with the help of OpenAI frontier model capabilities. · In July 2025, Instacart launched a pilot for its AI-powered smart carts called Caper Carts with Wegmans, and later in September expanded their omnichannel capabilities with loyalty and SNAP-EBT integrations along with improved product recommendations. · Uber Eats achieved a $12 billion Gross Bookings run rate for Grocery & Retail (G&R) in 3Q25, with 7% of Delivery first-time users acquired through G&R while existing users increasing frequency by 27% after G&R.

· In 2025, Uber expanded its relationship with Kroger (adding more than 2,600 stores across all Kroger banners) and signed many new merchants to the platform, including FreshDirect, ALDI (with over 2,500 stores nationwide and the platform's first retailer to accept SNAP-EBT nationwide), Dollar General, Family Dollar, and Dollar Tree. · DoorDash deepened its Kroger partnership in 2025, fulfilling roughly 1 million orders in the first month through Kroger's new hybrid model that leans on store-based fulfillment and expanded relationships with DoorDash. · The company also launched DashMart Fulfillment Services (DFS), to manage retailers' inventory, picking, packing, and last-mile via DashMarts; early adopters included CVS Pharmacy and Party City, with Kroger 'coming soon.'

· All major platforms advanced autonomous delivery capabilities in 2025, with Uber partnering with Starship for over 2,700 robots, expanding to over 12,000 by 2027, and DoorDash testing with Waymo, while expanding Coco Robotics to Miami.

We continue to favor Uber in the 3P delivery space given 1) its leadership position in Mobility and Delivery, which offers effective cross-sell opportunities; 2) its scale, which ensures Uber will remain the first call for autonomous vehicle OEMs looking to monetize their significant CapEx spend; 3) industry tailwinds, as consumers continue to become habituated with 3P delivery platforms; 4) largely stable unit economics, eventually improving over time, given lower driver incentives, rising frequency, and reduced insurance costs; and 5) achievable 3-year Bookings and EBITDA targets (from 2024 Investor Day) which could prove conservative as recent growth is outpacing guidance parameters.

We also like Instacart (recently upgraded to Outperform) with its 1) best-in-class grocery delivery platform (largest basket size among all three), 2) solid enterprise eCommerce platform, 3) nicely scaling (over $1 billion in annualized revenue) advertising business, 4) attractive buyback program (upsized to $1.65 billion total capacity as of 3Q25), and 5) attractive risk-reward ratio. DoorDash is also well-positioned into 2026 , with continuing investment in initiatives (new products, global tech stack and AI) that support long-term growth. Continuing DashPass adoption and strong execution in its core U.S. restaurants category are supporting accelerating order frequency which is driving order volume acceleration. In addition, new verticals continue to grow, driven by new partnerships in retail and grocery. Its recently launched DashMart Fulfillment should drive higher GOV and new vertical growth, given access to more inventory.

Mobility is bigger than rideshare. It targets personal car ownership and represents globally a $5+ trillion opportunity. We show below the AV/rideshare TAM which is a combination of passenger vehicle and public transport trips in 170+ countries. In the U.S., households spend more on transportation than on any other expenditure ex-housing, with consumers spending ~$1.6 trillion ($13,000 per household). Further, when we analyze rideshare gross bookings at the largest players today (Uber, Lyft, DiDi, and Grab) penetration remains at just over 1%. As such, the introduction of AVs on rideshare platforms is just another ingredient to shifting user behavior from car ownership to rideshare.

As highlighted earlier, the macro picture heading into 2026 is a bit blurry, but interestingly, travel is one of the few discretionary verticals still seeing resilient demand. We believe this resilience is supported by the intersection of two factors - the ongoing shift in consumer preferences towards experiences and the bifurcation of consumption patterns. The shift in consumer behavior (consumers increasingly prioritizing experiences and live events over material possessions in their spending) is particularly strong among millennials and Gen Z, which makes it a more durable trend. While a softening economy might slow down that momentum a bit, we don't expect a stall or reversal in 2026. At the same time, the tailwind from resilient consumer spending has endured through the whole of 2025, and we don't expect a reversal in 2026, unless the stock market turns around and ruins the "wealth effect" underpinning this elevated consumption.

· Thematically, AI advances should continue to provide a tailwind to travel demand in 2026, with agentic AI revolutionizing travel commerce by compressing discovery, planning, booking, and servicing into a single conversational journey. · Tactically, several major sporting events are happening in 2026 - including the 2026 Winter Olympics/Paralympics and the 2026 FIFA World Cup - and we expect to see incremental impetus to travel, despite elevated macro uncertainty. While we maintain our Market-Weight stance on global travel for 2026, given the increasing macro pressures on the average consumer, we are somewhat cautious on the travel space as the likelihood of an inflection in demand remains elevated for next year.

When looking at the progress that major online travel platforms have made with AI, we see that overall, Booking and Expedia lead in AI maturity with broad, production-scale deployment across consumer and partner surfaces with measurable adoption. At the same time, Airbnb and Tripadvisor are executing AInative transitions anchored in conversational UX, identity/trust, and proprietary content. AI-first discovery is reshaping traffic patterns with Expedia reporting higher-converting Gen AI traffic and Tripadvisor seeing exponentially growing GEO traffic, though from small bases.

· Booking's Connected Trip strategy shows measurable traction with low double-digit transaction share and mid-20% year-over-year growth in 3Q25, while its partner tools achieved a 73% uplift in satisfaction; · Expedia deploys the broadest AI ecosystem, with over 350 AI models across its marketplace and virtual agents handling nearly half of customer service inquiries while improving NPS and lowering costs; · Airbnb's AI support agent demonstrates early success by reducing human contact by approximately 15% in the U.S., with plans to expand to over 50 languages as part of the company's AI-native concierge vision; · Tripadvisor leverages proprietary content for AI differentiation with AI review summaries achieving ~75% satisfaction across over 30,000 hotels and trip-planner users showing 15x higher ARPU than platform average.

Consumer-facing AI is reshaping discovery, decisioning, and service across the online travel names. AI is also being applied across supply and partnerships to reduce onboarding friction, improve listing quality, automate guest-operator communication, and strengthen trust and compliance. The approaches vary by company, from agentic messaging for accommodation partners to B2B trip planning APIs and governance-first review integrity. AI-first discovery is shifting traveler behavior from list-based search to conversational 'answer engines.' Traffic is increasingly influenced by generative engine optimization (GEO/AEO) and deep integrations with platforms such as Google, OpenAI, and Perplexity. At the same time, AI is transforming ad targeting and content creation, with measurable impacts on direct traffic, loyalty, and cross-vertical attach.

· Introduced an AI customer support assistant with a custom, rich UI inside messaging that enables tailored answers and common actions (e.g., cancel/change) within chat; early U.S. deployment reduced human-agent contact by ~15%, with plans to expand to over 50 languages in 2026. The company positions this as the foundation for an AI-native concierge that integrates conversational search and AI customer service with identity, payments, and messaging across the entire trip lifecycle. · Continued personalization in the core app (e.g., recommended destinations, suggested filters, personalized listing highlights) supports a more tailored discovery experience. · Plans to roll out conversational, multi-turn AI search that outputs natural language and adapts responses to user context; iterative roll-outs targeted through 2026.

· Advancing computer vision-led listing automation: photos can auto-tag amenities, generate listing and neighborhood descriptions, and adapt visuals seasonally, streamlining host onboarding and content quality while enabling better pricing and revenue management. The company positions identity and payments as core rails, citing ~200M verified identities.

· Booking.com is adding natural language search with inspiration (destination highlights) and progressing toward agentic capabilities within its Connected Trip vision. · Launched AI Voice Support (English/German live; Italian/Spanish in testing) for voice-powered trip management, and AI-powered Flight Search Summaries (English-first; broader roll-out planned for 2026) that surface trade-offs like stops vs. price/time. · AI-first integrations with OpenAI and scale benefits from a single global tech stack and rich data enable faster user-side personalization and service automation. · KAYAK AI Mode brings natural-language search directly to the homepage (English, US; more languages/markets coming), blending KAYAK data with ChatGPT to produce contextual results, with voice entry to follow. · Booking reports reduced live agent contact rates and better resolution times via voice-enabled Gen AI in customer service; Priceline's 'Penny' AI assistant added voice and drove higher engagement/conversion.

· Partner-side Smart Messenger/Auto-Reply show strong satisfaction uplift (+73%) - a signal of maturing agentic tooling that is informing consumer experiences. Auto-Reply is live globally and Smart Messenger is rolling out in English-speaking markets including the U.S., U.K., New Zealand, and Australia. · Developing an AI Partner Assistant for onboarding and uses AI to share booking-pattern insights with properties. Agoda complements this with an AI Property AMA Bot answering over 30,000 hotel questions per day and a Content Enhancement Tool that upscales, de-duplicates, re-tags, and ranks over 450 million images, increasing gallery engagement and room-detail checks. · Booking.com's B2B reach expanded via a new Spotnana integration to its latest APIs, enabling access to full inventory and rates, configurable content controls for travel management companies, and improved servicing across languages and payment options.

· Embedded AI in shopping and post-booking flows, including AI filters, property Q&A, and review summaries; improved recommendation models contributed to record attach rates for Brand Expedia. Design flow updates in lodging and post-booking also drove double-digit vacation rental growth. · Insurance personalization delivered the highest attach rates ever; customer service virtual agents now handle nearly half of inquiries while improving NPS and lowering costs. · Actively optimizing for answer engine ecosystems and agentic search, noting Gen AI traffic converts at higher rates than other channels; partnerships include Google, OpenAI, and Perplexity. · Introduced Smart Trip AI, a conversational planner B2B partners can embed for curated, realtime recommendations; also Typeahead API with a 20% search-to-book conversion uplift, and a Lodging Sponsored Listings API to help partners monetize traffic. The company notes over 350 AI models integrated across its marketplace.

· Scale and adoption are reflected in $9.4 billion B2B gross bookings (+26% YoY), with Rapid API the fastest-growing product and the travel-agent business up 25%. Advertising tools also use AI to improve targeting and measurement via its partner ad portal, supporting supply visibility and merchandising without adding operational burden for partners.

· Deployed AI review summaries across hotels, and expanded across restaurants and attractions, with early hotel deployments posting ~75% satisfaction across over 30,000 hotels. · Rolled out an AI travel assistant and conversational trip planning that integrate proprietary content and clickstream data; engagement is rising and ARPU of trip-planner users is ~15x platform average (early scale, growing base). · Advancing integrations (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Azure) to extend AI reach and support voice-oriented guidance experiences; directly integrating the Tripadvisor and TheFork brands into ChatGPT. The company has also signed licensing deals with majority of the leading AI companies. · Deploys Gen AI to streamline operator onboarding and improve listing quality, while AI-based content moderation and fraud detection protect marketplace integrity. Its Transparency Report outlines multi-layer moderation and removal of 2.7 million fraudulent reviews and 214,000 AIgenerated reviews.

We believe Booking.com has a sustainable advantage in cross-border travel given its strong position in Europe and APAC (with Agoda). We find the company placed well for continued growth momentum as demand remains strongest in the latter region. Together, Booking.com and Agoda rank in the top five across all travel apps in key countries, including Japan, Thailand, Australia, South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia. At the same time, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky highlighted in November 2024 that the company is focused on the big four countries in Asia: India, China, South Korea, and Japan . While Airbnb does have attractive brand recognition in the region, Booking.com will continue to invest in marketing and supply initiatives, which will sustain a challenging competitive dynamic in 2026E and likely into 2027E.

In 2025, short-term rental (STR) platforms faced heightened compliance costs as compliance complexity increased with cities tightening rules, forcing platforms to verify licenses, and safety standards hardening, requiring centralized compliance ops functions for license/registry validation. U.S. municipalities intensified enforcement with tighter licensing rigor, stay caps, and complaint-response expectations, while platforms increased take-down exposure for listings without valid registration, creating operational complexity for multi-city operators. European regulatory momentum accelerated beyond data sharing with legislators signaling harmonized tools to curb housing pressures while preparing VAT obligations for platforms under ViDA (VAT in the Digital Age), an initiative by the European Commission aimed at modernizing and digitalizing the Value Added Tax system. The EU Parliament called for stronger harmonized measures in 2025, urging night caps, authorization/ permit schemes, zoning restrictions, and potential bans in shortage areas alongside ex ante compliance responsibility for platforms.

The UK introduced comprehensive national oversight with a proposed national register for STRs with expected submissions covering safety compliance and annual occupancy data, targeting an April 2026 launch. Tax obligations expand significantly, with the ViDA regulations making platforms deemed suppliers for VAT from July 1, 2028 and UK councils applying up to 100% Council Tax premium on second homes from April 2025. Still, alternative accommodations was the second-fastest growing segment after attractions in 2025. Booking reported roughly 10% year-over-year growth in both listings (reaching 8.6 million) and room nights in 3Q25. Similarly, Airbnb reported both listings and room nights (and seats) growing at roughly 9% year-over-year. We expect alternative accommodations to continue outpacing hotels in 2026.

In online travel, we continue to favor Booking Holdings because: 1) we believe the company currently has best-in-class AI capabilities with broad, production-scale deployment showing measurable adoption and positive P&L impact; 2) we like Booking's scale and more diversified market and product footprint; 3) we like the level of progress with Connected Trip and alternative accommodations; 4) new verticals (flights and attractions) continue to drive strong growth; and 5) its loyalty program is driving higher booking frequency and direct traffic to the platform. We remain on the sidelines for Airbnb , although we like the level of product innovation and platform improvements (which enhance the user experience and drive growth), as well as their expansion internationally and into new categories (experiences, services, hotels). However, both international markets and new categories are in their early innings and would take some time to become meaningful contributors, particularly given that Airbnb faces strong competition across both from Booking, Expedia, and Tripadvisor. Regulatory risks remain another key overhang to the longer-term model of Airbnb.

While we remain neutral on Expedia , we want to highlight that we like their cost discipline (driving margin expansion) and management focus on strategic priorities including delivering more value to travelers, growth investments (AI, new product features, etc.), and operational efficiencies. But with macro uncertainty still elevated and given Expedia's higher exposure to the US market (facing stronger headwinds than international markets), we are watching closely for signs of softening travel demand. We also remain on the sidelines for Tripadvisor ; we are encouraged by management decision to shift operating model to focus on Experiences and AI but highlight elevated execution risk (always present in Tripadvisor's history). We appreciate the company's cost savings program (20% headcount reduction) expected to generate $85 million in annual savings by 2027, but Tripadvisor's core challenge remains translating its industry-leading traffic and strong planning influence into bookings.
