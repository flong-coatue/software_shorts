Stock Thoughts. Shares were up about 10% year-to-date heading into the first-quarter print, and the solid earnings results helped push them up another 2% today. We believe the continued momentum is based on the following factors:

· Net revenue guidance was raised ($75 million) slightly more than the first-quarter beat ($60 million). The acquisitions were essentially offset by divestitures, and although we do not have specific numbers, this appears to be a slight organic raise for the remainder of the year. · The company's largest segment, the international business, was quite strong (+13%) and well above buy-side expectations. The long-term outlook here looks good, particularly in the United Kingdom/Ireland through the AMP8 program and Canada through programs dealing with nuclear power and arctic shipping lanes. · The federal business performed better than feared during the shutdown period, growing 7% excluding USAID/DoS. Management highlighted several promising areas for growth moving forward through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the U.S. Missle Defense Agency, to name a few.

· Most of the first-quarter net revenue beat ($60 million) was due to Ukraine (we estimate about $50 million in net revenue), which many expected to be zero in the first quarter. Although this revenue is episodic, volatile, and unpredictable; the company does have employees on the ground and more revenue could come in fiscal 2026 that is not baked into our model. · Investors see several sources of upside to numbers for fiscal 2026 and 2027. First, management tends to be conservative in its first-quarter guide, implying the potential for another raise in either the second or third quarter of this year. Second, we expect the company to ramp up M&A in the coming periods, with the potential for large, needlemoving deals comparable to prior transactions like Coffey, WYG, and RPS.

We view management's updated outlook for 2026 as achievable with potential for upside through unexpected sources (e.g., Ukraine, disaster response), organic sources (e.g., U.K. water, Canada power transmission), and accretive capital deployment given the strength of the company's balance sheet (net leverage below 1.0x) and attractive M&A landscape. We reiterate our Outperform rating.

Sources: FactSet, William Blair & Company estimates Tetra Tech is a global provider of high-end consulting and engineering & design services focused on water, environmental, and sustainable infrastructure.

Consolidated Net Revenue growth was down 13%. We estimate underlying net revenue growth, which excludes acquisitions, disaster response, and USAID/DoS revenue, was 7% this quarter, up from midsingle-digit growth in 2025. By client category: · Federal net revenue growth was down 44%. Excluding disaster response, USAID and DoS, underlying net revenue growth was up 7%. · State & Local net revenue growth was down 19%. Excluding disaster response, underlying net revenue growth was up 10%. · Commercial net revenue growth was down 3%, essentially in line with our estimate for down low to midsingle digits. · International net revenue growth was up 13%, better than our estimate for up high single digits.

Backlog declined 2% year-over-year (excluding USAID and DoS) to $3.95 billion. The decline was primarily driven by weaker federal government task orders resulting from the 6-week government shutdown, partly offset by strong bookings in state and local, commercial, and international. Federal government task order activity is expected to normalize as the company exits the fiscal second quarter. The Call. At $38, shares of Tetra Tech trade at 16 times our NTM adjusted EBITDA estimate of $653 million. Applying a multiple of 16 times to our calendar 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate of $705 million implies approximately 15% upside in shares over the next 12 to 18 months. We see upside from capital deployment, based on our expectation for the company to generate more than $1.4 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. Investment risks include customer concentration, project risk, elongated sales cycles, public client risk, deregulation, competition, M&A, and weather disruption.
