January 26, 2026 EARNINGS PREVIEW

Below, we offer our thoughts as we head into 4Q25 earnings. 3P data suggests the e-commerce group had a healthy 4Q overall, though recent commentary from Amazon suggests there may be incremental pricing pressure on the consumer in 2026, which makes us more cautious on the group in 2026. We prefer to own names with multiple business lines and revenue streams (AMZN), or those with outsized growth (PTRN) .

The Big Picture: Overall, 3P data suggests the e-commerce group had a healthy Holiday Season and 4Q overall. Recent commentary from Amazon (CEO, Jassy in Davos) that its pre-tariff inventory was largely depleted in 3Q suggests there may be incremental pricing pressure on the consumer in 2026 and gives us some pause on a group that has largely rebounded beyond pre-tariff levels-we feel the group should trade somewhere between its pre-tariff levels and the Liberation Day trough. For e-comm, we prefer to own names with multiple business lines and revenue streams (AMZN), or those with outsized growth (PTRN). TSA volumes and recent airline commentary bodes well for YOU, and we've already heard from LIF on 4Q numbers that were ahead of consensus (and MAU growth expected to be +20% in 2026).

· AMZN: We want to own AMZN into the print with positive checks on the advertising side, a healthy 4Q e-commerece backdrop (and Holiday Season), and AWS growth that looks more than reasonable to us. We do have concerns about the health of the average consumer but believe there is enough here to offset that weakness, and we expect last year's stock underperformance to turn into outperformance when all is said and done in 2026. · UBER: Focus remains on the impact of robotaxis over time, but we continue to believe that debate won't be settled for some time. Nearterm, we like where Street numbers are to start the year, and believe the company will continue to execute on Mobility/Eats. We leave our estimates unchanged, and shift our TP to $105.

· DASH: Sentiment has taken a step back as we await to see the impact to margins on the first full quarter of the Deliveroo integration/ replatforming. We've revised estimates a bit to more appropriately bake in the impact from Deliveroo, and remain slightly below Street as we attempt to keep our numbers on the conservative side as we gain more comfort in the Deliveroo integration. Our TP goes to $224. · EBAY: We like where estimates are as the company laps tougher comps this quarter (trading cards, UK C2C), and expect a favorable 1Q guide against lighter comps. We leave estimates unchanged and keep our TP of $88 as we roll NTM forward to 1Q26. Similar to the rest of the group, we're increasingly cautious on the health of the average consumer as we start 2026.

· CART: Competitive pressures continue to weigh on the stock, which we believe is baked into current estimates. We leave estimates unchanged (currently forecasting ~2ppts of share loss in 4Q) yet lower our TP to $46 as sentiment has taken a step back.

· W: The category witnessed a second consecutive quarter of mid-teens % growth according to 3P data, and we do believe Wayfair continues to take share in the Home category. We view management's willingness to cut bait on geos that don't appear to be ideal candidates for long-term strategic success as a positive. We're a bit cautious on the consumer as some (AMZN) have suggested tariffs are only now starting to hit the consumer. · ETSY: 3P data showed strong MAU gains for both the Etsy app and Depop which we believe could lead to potential upside in GMS for the quarter as the company continues to drive users towards the Etsy app and began its Depop marketing push in 4Q. We leave estimates unchanged and slightly lower our TP to $62.

· PTRN: The stock has rebounded since a December short report which put shares below IPO levels ($14), and we believe investors will increasingly warm up to this one as the company continues to execute. Recent addition of part of the Authentic Brands portfolio and incremental steps to embrace other marketplaces (TikTok, etc.) will continue to shift exposure away from Health & Wellness and dependence on Amazon. We leave our estimates intact and keep our TP of $22. continued below Mark Kelley | (312) 564-8708 | kelleymar@stifel.com John Kuntz | (312) 564-8704 | kuntzj@stifel.com Brennan Robinson | (212) 271-3811 | robinsonbr@stifel.com Stifel Equity Trading Desk | (800) 424-8870

As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this report. Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making their investment decision.

· LIF: Flash 4Q numbers released by the company (1/22) were ahead of Street (link), and management guided 2026 MAUs to 20% growth (vs. Street +16.5%). MAU growth, in particular, was the main pressure point for shares post 3Q25 earnings-the debate has shifted to "is the guide conservative enough" for beats throughout the year, paired with questions around the Nativo integration. We revise our model to reflect the midpoint of 4Q updated figures, but leave 2026 estimates relatively unchanged as we await the geographical mix for MAUs. TP goes to $76. · YOU: After some noise around whether the government shutdown would affect 4Q flyer numbers, TSA travel volumes were relatively healthy on a year-over-year basis, which should provide some support to the airport business. We also believe investors are warming up to the non-aviation business. Our estimates remain unchanged, and we keep our $38 TP on a rolled-forward NTM multiple.

We previously wrote about Cyber Monday spending results (here), which came in better than expected, with online spend growing +HSD% y/y for a second consecutive year and beat initial forecasts from earlier this year (per Adobe). Adobe recently reported its total holiday spending results, posting a record $257.8bn online spend (+6.8% y/y) which came above its forecasted spend of $253.4bn (+5.3% y/y). Salesforce reported online sales during the holiday season of $1.29tn globally (+7% y/y) and $294bn in the U.S. (+4% y/y) yet noted that the return rate for the holiday season rose to 14% from 10.3% in 2024. We also note commentary from AMZN CEO Andy Jassy last week at Davos who stated that the company is starting to see higher ASPs due to tariffs as the majority of seller inventory that had been purchased prior to the implementation of tariffs had run out during 3Q. This is evidenced in Cyber Week data where pricing drove the majority of spending

growth: Online sales growth outpaced volume growth by +MSDppts; AOVs grew +4.65% y/y while units per transaction growth declined -1% y/y (per Salesforce). While December data has yet to be released, Non-Store Sales for 4Q currently show a slight deceleration from 3Q. However, as we heard in our 4Q advertising checks (link), the quarter got off to a slow start with the bulk of spend getting deployed in the month of December. We expect the same trends likely manifested within consumer spending and believe Non-Store Sales growth will likely see a nice increase following the inclusion of December data.

The Salesforce Shopping Index was recently updated with 4Q25 figures. Global and U.S. both saw a modest 100bps acceleration in e-commerce growth while Germany posted a 600bps acceleration for the quarter. UK and Italy were both laggards, with growth decelerating 300bps and 500bps q/q, resp. The Index is also broken out by category, which shows the Furniture category gaining momentum as it saw a second consecutive quarter of midteens % growth. Health & Beauty remains the strongest category, which saw quarter-over-quarter accelerations of at least 400bps each of the last three quarters amidst a tougher 4Q comp. Electronics & Accessories and Food & Beverage were the next two highest performers, both achieving HSD% growth.

We take a look at the U.S. Census Bureau's published monthly and quarterly retail sales data (which also outlines e-Commerce trends) to frame market share trends within our e-Commerce coverage (AMZN, EBAY, ETSY, and W). In 3Q25, total U.S. retail sales grew +2.4% year-over-year (+60bps acceleration), with e-Commerce penetration reaching down to 15.8% from 15.5% in 1Q (up +43bps y/y). According to our analysis, Amazon saw the greatest increase in share within its own vertical, now with a 59.8% share in its categories, the company increased its share to +265bps year-over-year and +97bps quarter-over-quarter. This was followed by eBay, whose category share is now 31.5% (+123bps y/y, -205bps q/q). Wayfair continues to recover share on a year-over-year basis, now

at 12.5% (+90bps y/y, -122bps q/q). Etsy continues to lose share, falling to 8.4% share (-45bps y/y, -29bps q/q). Our top pick in e-Commerce remains AMZN, which we view as a share gainer regardless of macro conditions.

We take a look at Brick Meets Click's published monthly Grocery Shopper Survey, sponsored by Mercatus, to frame market share for CART. In 4Q25, U.S. eGrocery sales reached a record high of $35.1bn (+18.2% y/y), marking the first quarter-over-quarter deceleration in 6 quarters, and what we estimate to be a record high for eGrocery penetration at 14.8% of U.S. Grocery Sales (U.S. Census Bureau retail sales data unreleased for December). For Instacart, this marks the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year market share loss, now at 26.0% of U.S. eGrocery sales based on our 4Q25 GTV estimates. We view share loss due to heightened efforts from competitors (Amazon, DoorDash) which are driving incremental shopper adoption, particularly for Delivery and Ship to Home eGrocery sales, as the category outpaces CART's GTV growth.

TSA Travel Throughput: 4Q TSA travel throughput was +1.1% y/y, decelerating ~135bps vs. +2.4% y/y in 3Q. During October, travel volumes were tracking higher as much as +4.5% y/y, though those increases largely paired back in November and December to reach a lower (but still positive year-over-year) +1.1% level. For 1Q, we're encouraged by strong QTD trends (TSA volumes +4.0% y/y so far in January).

Amazon is one of the primary beneficiaries of COVID given accelerated eCommerce sales growth and Prime membership adoption, as well as the digital transformation that will accelerate cloud services adoption, which we expect to see over a longer time frame. The pandemic has sparked online adoption of grocery and consumables, categories Amazon has struggled to penetrate for many years and should support the next leg of retail growth. As the leader in two large and rapidly growing sectors (eCommerce & cloud), with an emerging high-margin marketing business, we believe Amazon remains well positioned in a recovery scenario given cloud services, marketing services and certain eCommerce categories/geographies are still in the early phases of development.

Overall, we view CART as one of the best-positioned businesses to benefit from continued online penetration of the U.S. grocery market (12% adoption in 2022 likely going to 20%+ by 2027). The category as a whole is largely predictive, given the overwhelming majority of grocery purchases are non-discretionary, with Americans spending approximately $1.1T on groceries in 2022 (LT 3% CAGR). We also believe there is more room for Instacart to grow its advertising business from its current adoption rate of just under 3% (percent of GTV), to 4-5% over the medium term, as many scaled Retail Media businesses currently monetize approximately 5% of online sales with ads. We also expect the margin profile of the business to improve from here towards the company's long-term adjusted EBITDA target of approximately 39%, as many of the opex lines are at or near scale today.

DoorDash is currently the market leader in restaurant delivery, and continues to expand into adjacent categories and markets (grocery, convenience, alcohol, general retail, home improvement), but the competitive environment also continues to grow. We believe increased competition (we point to Uber Eats + Instacart partnership) poses a threat to DoorDash's U.S. market share, and competitor apps' alternative product offerings (i.e. Uber's ridershare) give users multiple reasons to use their apps. DoorDash has executed well as an industry consolidator historically, and we expect that this trend will likely continue, especially outside the U.S. We believe DoorDash has

been successful integrating Wolt, which expanded DoorDash's offering to Europe (remains a standalone brand), and we believe the Deliveroo Acquisition will further solidify its offering in the region. If DoorDash is able to integrate the Deliveroo acquisition as effectively as it has integrated past acquisitions, DoorDash will continue to gain scale which it should be able to leverage as it expands both internationally and into adjacent verticals / offerings. We also believe the relatively new and sub-scale advertising business will continue to expand and offer upside to margins globally.

eBay is a dominant e-commerce platform that connects third-party sellers with buyers globally (current in 190+ countries) and, in our view, fills a unique need in online commerce with a seemingly endless supply of goods across a vast array of categories. The company continues to make strides with its technology-enabled strategy and focus on higher-quality buyers, but we think it may take more time to see the benefits of the turnaround that has been underway for a few years to truly come to fruition. We do believe eBay is taking the right approach, however, with a focus on key categories (sneakers, watches, automotive parts and accessories, etc.), which is a category-by-category focus that appears to be driving results underneath the corporate-level KPIs, and we're hopeful that the enthusiast buyer community continues to lean on eBay for their purchases. That said, the near-term trends across the buyer base (including enthusiast buyers) leave us on the sidelines here, despite a very favorable capital return

strategy (management outlined plans to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders, and we expect those commitments to continue beyond the current plan as eBay's FCF conversion is better than most peers). We would look to become more positive when we have greater visibility on more meaningful GMV growth acceleration against a backdrop of a healthier buyer base.

Etsy is a leading global eCommerce platform for special occasions, handmade and vintage goods spanning multiple product categories, including jewelry, apparel and accessories, wedding, home décor, and craft supplies. Etsy has successfully built a differentiated marketplace and developed a number of key seller services to help improve seller efficiency and grow seller volume on the platform. As the leader in the niche market of artisanal goods, we believe Etsy has carved out a favorable competitive position with formidable barriers. The company is exiting a transition period where operations were streamlined, resources refocused and a number of initiatives implemented to reinvigorate GMS growth.

Overall, we view LIF's technological advantage in its core product offering as a driver of continued market share gains. The company's highly engaged and growing active user base provides a clear pathway toward increased monetization and improved financial performance. We believe there is room for growing penetration in its core markets (currently used by 13% of U.S. smartphone owners) and significant headroom for growth internationally (only ~0.3% penetration outside its core markets). The company is also in early stages of growing its advertising business (launched during 1Q24), which management believes will grow to rival its subscription business in scale over time (subscription revenue is currently ~73% of total revenue). This would likely unlock increased monetization of the company's free user base (~90% of users) and improve the company's margin profile. We believe the company's access to a large amount of location data will differentiate its advertising offering, and will likely draw the attention of many marketers' performance budgets.

We believe Pattern is a well-positioned leader in the e-commerce accelerator category with strong brand retention (~half of revenue from brands that have been with Pattern for five years or more), leading edge technical capabilities, and seasoned fulfillment and distribution

personnel that can manage a wide array of products. We believe the company will successfully expand and grow brands outside of Amazon U.S., where it has cultivated a proven track record for the past decade as what we believe to be both the largest seller and advertiser on the marketplace. We don't believe there is a natural churn even once a brand experiences how Pattern operates; piecemealing together the necessary software, fulfillment guidance, and marketing wherewithal would be a challenging task that poses significant risk to a brand's online sales, should a brand look to emulate Pattern's processes in-house. While Pattern is currently concentrated in the Health & Wellness (H&W) category (63% of product sales), we believe this is a combination of the natural result of scaling its earliest brand partners (the majority H&W) and the company's diligence in brand partner selection (we believe ~1 in ~10 inbound requests are accepted), and we expect the company to minimize its H&W exposure as it goes after an identified TAM of ~$400bn for new brand partners.

We increasingly view Uber as a super app, with multiple use cases for consumer utilization across mobility, restaurant, and grocery delivery. Uber is currently investing in autonomous vehicles (AVs), which we currently believe pose minimal risk to Uber's business over the near-tomedium term; we see some hurdles before AVs become a tangible and everyday use case, including (1) increased technological advances to ensure autonomous vehicles operate in a manner that is significantly safer than human drivers, (2) a clearer view of the global regulatory framework, (3) significant improvement in the cost to manufacture autonomous vehicles, and (4) large investments in the infrastructure that is required to power and maintain a meaningful AV fleet. We also believe Uber will ultimately be successful in Delivery, which aids in customer acquisition and retention, particularly in less dense / non-urban areas. We are bullish on Uber's advertising opportunity, with the company's differentiated location data at scale providing a significant data advantage for retail media advertisers. Uber's currently low advertising penetration (~0.9% of core Gross Bookings) leaves plenty of runway to

scale the ads business, with many mature retail media products reaching 5+% of Gross Bookings over time; just getting to 2.5% penetration adds an incremental $1 billion of annualized revenue for Uber.

We believe Wayfair has done an impressive job growing the online portion of the home furnishings category, which is a segment most investors and consumers viewed as too high of a price point in the not-so-distant past. Wayfair remains one of the most dominant furniture retailers, and we expect that to remain for the foreseeable future. We also believe the company is likely to execute against its strategy to reach mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA margins in the near-to-medium-term, with the potential to approach its longer-term target of 10% over time. We are, however, waiting for more evidence that active customers can return to a more predictable growth cadence from here, and average order values continue to face headwinds from a U.S. consumer base that is increasingly shifting back towards the purchase of services, and less so on goods as personal savings rates have eased substantially, and with COVID-led stimulus benefits no longer a source of funds for many. We do expect the greater home furnishings and appliances market to stabilize over the medium term, and recent

third-party data suggests there are some green shoots in the stabilization theme in the near term.

We're fans of the product, having used Clear Plus for several years, but we're mixed on the incremental opportunity from here and see both positives and potential headwinds going forward. Namely, on the key important positives, we anticipate continued growth from the AMEX partnership as the company works toward its 25% penetration targets (potential for $35mn+ of incremental bookings). Also, the business does not mirror the overall travel industry, which we view as a positive (enrollments grew and retention held up reasonably well during COVID), and there is still an opportunity to expand across the U.S. airport footprint (both with existing footprint and new) and with the nascent Platform business. Potential headwinds could come in the form of a lack of international opportunities outside the RESERVE product, given the nature and process of achieving approval outside the U.S. to operate a similar product to that which U.S. users have become accustomed. TSA pre-check may be considered 'good enough' in the eyes of the consumer, and some of the company's nonaviation locations

have not renewed the partnership, which could diminish the ease-of-use network effects.

Target Price Methodology : Our $300 target price is based on 16x our NTM adjusted EBITDA estimate of $208bn. Risks : Competition from eCommerce companies and traditional retailers, difficulty expanding internationally, resumption of an extended investment cycle, faster-than-expected maturation in North America, competition from other cloud service providers, and macroeconomic trends that negatively impact consumer spend could put pressure on shares.

Target Price Methodology : Our target price of $46 is based on 9x our NTM adjusted EBITDA estimate of $1.18bn.

Risks: Competition: There is intense competition within the company's core Marketplace business (DoorDash, Uber Eats, GoPuff, Shipt, Fresh Direct, native offerings, among others), as well as within the Retail Media and general digital advertising market (Criteo, Trade Desk, Microsoft/PromoteIQ, Publicis/CitrusAd, among others). Some of Instacart's competitors are well-capitalized, and in some cases betterknown businesses, some of which are also partners. Consumer Behavior and COVID-19 Impact: While e-commerce penetration for U.S. groceries has remained above pre-COVID levels over the past few years, there is a risk that some consumers are still operating in a manner similar to how they behaved during and immediately preceding the early onset of the COVID pandemic. Regulatory: There is ongoing scrutiny on the status of contractors/gig workers both domestically and internationally. Failure to Scale the Advertising Business: While retail media is a relatively new category within the digital advertising ecosystem with plenty of room

for multiple vendors and technology suppliers, new digital advertising strategies may arise over time, diminishing the greater retail media segment. Failure to Expand Internationally: Though Instacart is primarily focused on North America at this time, international expansion is a potential growth driver over the long-term.

Target Price Methodology: Our target price of $224 is based on 26x our NTM Adjusted EBITDA estimate of $3.60bn.

Risks: Competition: There is intense competition within the company's core Marketplace business (Uber Eats, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, Amazon, among others), as well as within the Retail Media and general digital advertising market (Criteo, Trade Desk, Publicis/CitrusAd, among others). Some of DoorDash's competitors are well-capitalized, and in some cases better-known businesses. Given the competitive dynamics of the industry, the company may have to modify its customer acquisition strategy, which could impact its profitability targets over the long-term. Gig Economy Model: The classification of drivers as independent contractors continues to face legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Potential changes in labor laws or adverse court rulings could force the company to reclassify its Dashers as employees, which would expose the company to adverse business, financial, tax, legal, and other consequences. High turnover and dissatisfaction among its driver base may disrupt operations, increase onboarding costs, and

negatively impact customer experience. Macroeconomic Conditions: As the company's core platform relies on discretionary services (food-delivery), macro economic volatility and changes in consumer confidence and disposable income may lead to consumers cutting back on use of its services. Failure to Scale the Advertising Business: While retail media is a relatively new category within the digital advertising ecosystem with plenty of room for multiple vendors and technology suppliers, new digital advertising strategies may arise over time, diminishing the greater retail media segment.

Target Price Methodology: Our target price of $88 is based on 12x our NTM adjusted EBITDA estimate of $3.58bn. Risks: For eBay, risks include: eCommerce competition; cross-border trade; shifting consumer preferences; regulatory risks related to eBay's ticketing business; and the technology shift from personal computers to mobile devices. Etsy, Inc. (ETSY) Target Price Methodology: Our target price of $62 is based on 11.5x our NTM adjusted EBITDA estimate of $759mn. Risks: Etsy faces a number of key risks including, faster-than-expected growth maturation due to the uncertain TAM (slowing seller/ active buyer growth), competitive pressures, adverse FX fluctuations, and negative impacts from macro changes that contract consumer discretionary spend.

Target Price Methodology: Our target price of $76 is based on 10x our NTM sales estimate of $649mn. Risks: Risks include competition from larger technology platforms (Apple, Google, Samsung), failure to scale internationally, failure to scale the advertising business, impact on data collection and use from privacy initiatives globally, risk that inappropriate user/member behavior may negatively impact brand perception, failure to protect user data may impact the company's brand image and hurt future user growth, and failure to maintain supplier and distributor relationships may impact future growth prospects.

Target Price Methodology: Our target price of $22 is based on 19x our NTM Adjusted EBITDA estimate of $191mn. Risks: Reliance on Amazon Marketplace: 94% of revenue is generated from product sales on Amazon. An adverse shift in the company's relationship with Amazon would materially inhibit continued growth and the financial outlook of the company. Brand partner account suspensions, changes in payment policy, and increased fulfillment fees also pose risks. Tariffs: Though there isn't any direct tariff exposure, indirect exposure from China represents ~9% of sales and incremental tariffs may put pressure on brands' import costs. Additionally, broadbased inflation from tariffs may adversely impact the end-consumer, which would negatively impact future sales growth. Data-sourcing regulation: If the company is unable to collect and/or use data collected from one or more of its sources (customers, brand

partners, website scraping, other data collected from marketplaces, etc.) due to either new/changing laws or rules/policies of third parties (including marketplaces), its ability to accurately make forecasts and evaluate consumer behavior may be impacted and inhibit its ability to grow its brand partners. Concentration in Health and Wellness: 63% of the company's product sales are within the Health and Wellness category. A failure to diversify into other product verticals may result in inhibited growth opportunities in the event the overall category experiences stagnating growth and/or a pullback in consumer spend. Brands Bringing Services In-House: The company's partnership-based model depends on maintaining existing brand relationships (~89% of revenue) and signing partnerships with new brands (~11% of revenue). As brands scale in size, they may decide to acquire or build in-house versions of Pattern's services (i.e. an in-house marketing team) instead.

Target Price Methodology: Our target price of $105 is based on 18x our NTM Adjusted EBITDA estimate of $10.75bn. Risks: Autonomous Vehicles: Uber's autonomous vehicle (AV) strategy relies on partnerships rather than in-house development, making its AV rollout dependent on partner reliability and successful integration. Delays in technology, regulatory hurdles, and high capital needs could disrupt progress, while competing AV networks from companies like Tesla and Zoox pose additional threats. Competition: Uber faces intense competition across its core Mobility (e.g., Bolt, Lyft, Ola) and Delivery (e.g., DoorDash, Instacart, Amazon) platforms, as well as in retail media and digital advertising. Many competitors are well-capitalized and, in some cases, better-known, which may force Uber to adjust its customer acquisition strategies, potentially impacting long-term profitability. Gig Economy Model: The company's gig economy model

is under ongoing legal and regulatory scrutiny regarding driver classification. Changes in labor laws or adverse court rulings could require reclassifying drivers as employees, leading to significant business, financial, and legal consequences. High driver turnover and dissatisfaction could further disrupt operations and harm customer experience. Macroeconomic Conditions: Uber's reliance on discretionary consumer spending makes it vulnerable to macroeconomic volatility; declines in consumer confidence or disposable income could reduce demand for its services. Failure to Scale the Advertising Business: While retail media is a relatively new category within the digital advertising ecosystem with plenty of room for multiple vendors and technology suppliers, new digital advertising strategies may arise over time, diminishing the greater retail media segment.

Target Price Methodology: Our target price of $100 is based on 18.65x our NTM Adjusted EBITDA estimate of $809mn. Risks: For Wayfair, risks include: international expansion execution; the cyclicality of the home category; and competition from both offline and online businesses.

Target Price Methodology : Our target price of $38 is based on 13.5x our NTM EBITDA estimate of $309mn. Risks: In addition to general market and macroeconomic factors, risks include: increasing competition, execution risk related to new verticals, data security and reputational risk, and regulatory risks related to aviation.
