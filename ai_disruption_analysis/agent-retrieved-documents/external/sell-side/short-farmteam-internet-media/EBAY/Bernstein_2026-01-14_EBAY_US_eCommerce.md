US eCommerce stocks are off to a strong start in 2026 - even Amazon! 2025 showed us that eCommerce continues to take share from brick & mortar (not a surprise), and marketplace models are more resilient against displacement and tariffs than we probably gave credit for (surprise). The return to HSD GMV growth for US eCommerce feels more attainable as the larger platforms all accelerated in 2025. Our stocks, more so than the industry at large, have to contend with tougher compares as we move through the year, particularly in 2H26. But for now the basket likely continues to trade favorably with growing optimism around a bigger tax refund season and TAM-expanding AI greenshoots that could unlock higher conversion rates and incremental GMV. The second order effects of AI are nuanced and will continue to be debated in 2026.

2025 proved to be a good year for US eCommerce stocks. The group largely outperformed the market in 2025. While growth rates were more subdued than other verticals of US Internet (and remain so), positive revisions and accelerating top-line drove the stocks higher. Wayfair and Carvana (not covered) led the way. Notably, Amazon lagged, though it was plagued more by sentiment around AWS, while its eCommerce business continues to hum along nicely. Amazon is our top pick across the eCommerce basket, with 2026 offering the most attractive bull case story we've had since the pandemic years ago. The SMID-Cap basket likely continues to set-up well for now (2H could look a bit different), but we remain on the sidelines given how much the stocks have already run and would be more interested on pullbacks/digestion of idiosyncratic factors.

We update our industry model, which is available upon request. We assume 8%+ US eCommerce growth in 2026E with a ~9% CAGR through 2030E. From a penetration rate perspective, we forecast US eCommerce reaching 22% of total retail sales by 2030E (vs. 17.0% today). Our model is built up at the category-level for the domestic market. We expect under-penetrated verticals (e.g., grocery, personal care, autos) and more mid-cycle categories (e.g., apparel and home goods) to be stronger contributors to growth. Globally (ex-China), we forecast a ~10% CAGR over the next 5 years.

Themes to watch. Building on our US Internet sector outlook (see: US Internet: Narratives that matter in 2026) we think key themes and stock drivers this year will be: (1) durability of the acceleration we saw in 2025, particularly for the SMID-Caps that finally returned to more convincing growth rates; (2) consumer experimentation with Agentic Commerce tools and integrations (which we can envision making up a LSD % of eCommerce GMV next year); (3) automation and speedier delivery; and (4) online grocery, a battleground vertical in 2026.

AMZN (Outperform, PT $300): A perennial sellside top pick may have investors convinced we're crying wolf. But 2026 is shaping up as the most attractive bull case story we've had on Amazon since the pandemic seven years ago . A tepid 2025 stock performance offers a more palatable entry point, while the two KPIs that matter - AWS revenue growth and Retail margins - both appears poised to accelerate this year. While this is an eCom focused note, we expect AWS growth to correlate closely as capacity is brought online and re-establish AWS as a market leader/winner in an AI-fueled expanding hyperscaler TAM. On Retail, fears of AI disruption are likely overdone with a heavy slate of expected AI shopping assistants product launches this year are not too dissimilar from where Google was at the start of last year. More importantly to near term numbers and the story, Amazon is one of the best positioned companies to deliver material gross margin expansion as we go throughout the year led by fulfillment and logistics-focused

robotics. Tighter cost controls on discretionary initiatives, headcount efficiencies, and capitalization of Project Leo (Kuiper) should all contribute to retail margins expansion. W (Market-Perform, PT $105): Wayfair stock more than doubled in 2025 as the company delivered accelerating revenue growth and substantial EBITDA upside - and it has continued to run to start 2026 as the market anticipates a favorable outcome on the Supreme Court tariff ruling. We were particularly impressed with Q3 results, which delivered more convincing share gain from our vantage point (vs. prior quarters) and further expense discipline. We like the story but feel the stock has run away from us as it gets priced for an increasingly optimistic outlook. Much of this will hinge on revenue growth. Growing at MSD vs. HSD has an impact on EBTIDA flow-through and revisions vs. Street expectations. We think the set-up is probably still favorable near-term, but could get tougher as the comps becoming more challenging beyond Q2.

EBAY (Market-Perform, PT $90): eBay followed up a solid 2024 with a strong 2025, and the stock was rewarded for it. The high-class problem now facing eBay is one of GMV and EBIT growth durability. GMV growth hit 8% Y/Y in 3Q25 on an FxN basis, with the US business growing 13% - rates that felt completely out of reach at the start of the year. While it's easy to point to category tailwinds, the fact that eBay is participating in this growth is also a sign of progress. However, the 2025 strength sets up a conundrum for the stock tactically in 2026. Lapping these comps, particularly in 2H, will not be easy and tailwinds could turn into headwinds if a segment like Collectibles rolls over. Couple that with a lack of firm commitment on margin expansion (so far, guidance still to come) and the set-up feels tricky. We expect solid Y/Y growth in 4Q25 and 1Q26 to start the year before the tougher compares kick in.

ETSY (Market-Perform, PT $60): Etsy stock found slightly better footing in 2025 after a challenging 2023/24, but it continues to be a volatile name. GMS remains the primary KPI in question as the company tries to get itself back on a path of consistent growth. We think 4Q25 will showcase positive Y/Y trends for the first time in years (for core Etsy.com), but the comps are also easy and remain so into 1Q26. The 2-year stack has shown marginal progress in recent quarters, making us more wary of positive GMS growth into 2H26. New CEO, Kruti Patel Goyal, will look to put Etsy on a better trajectory - and the key variable we care about is frequency (GMS per Buyer will be the core proxy we can track on a quarterly basis). For us, Etsy remains in the neutral camp until we can gain greater confidence in the turnaround. To that end, it'll be interesting to see if

the company reverts to providing annual guidance again in 2026 now that the business has stabilized a bit. Etsy has also been an early participant in third-party AI integrations (ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot) and is one to watch for indications of financial impact and incrementality - it could help turn the narrative more positive.

2025 offered upside surprise, as the US eCommerce basket saw Y/Y GMV growth acceleration and share gains vs. brick & mortar retail, despite what looked to be a deteriorating set-up in Q1/Q2 given weakening consumer confidence and tariffs. At the industry level, we estimate US eCommerce grew 7%+ in 2025, with core European markets also settling in the MSD to HSD range. While those absolute figures aren't necessarily all that impressive at face value, they point to the directional improvement in demand trends across our coverage that we observed from 2Q25 onward. Our US eCommerce Long View called for HSD growth over a multi-year period, and that forecast feels more durable today.

We think 2026 could see stable-to-modestly accelerating trends at the industry level vs. 2025 considering: (1) stronger exit rate with upper-income consumers offering a backstop on demand; (2) 1P and 3P AI tools that should improve search & discovery of online merchandise relative to the in-store shopping experience; (3) continued secular tailwinds for digital migration (e.g., deflationary nature of eCommerce, variety of assortment, demographic shifts, and improving logistics models); and (4) breakout moments for key categories like grocery, which has historically been under-penetrated vs. other verticals.

We can debate the implications on margins, but the sector broadly offered a message of reinvestment into the new year as well, which should support GMV growth. For example, Amazon is scaling a new and improved grocery offering, while ondemand platforms like DoorDash and Uber continue to lean into the category as well. Amazon's Rufus is already driving $10B of annualized GMV and Wayfair's AI-driven product discovery page and growing loyalty program could help with share gain, while eBay is recycling GMV upside from collectibles into new focus categories and product features, and Etsy is investing in marketing to grow Depop in the US. While the macro backdrop is mixed with a bifurcated US consumer, 2025 showed us that there is growth and market share to be had for the companies that execute well.

The early part of the year could benefit further from a stronger tax refund season with consumers expected to receive an average $3.8K in refunds in 2026 vs. ~$3K in each of the past two years. Simultaneously, 2Q26 onward will present a tougher test for Y/Y growth rates at the company-level. While not so apparent in the industry-level data we track, our coverage companies accelerated GMV through the year, particularly those exposed to specific verticals that improved (e.g., Wayfair and home goods, eBay and collectibles + auto parts). There are certainly puts and takes on the macro front that could swing top-down demand in either direction, like the trajectory of interest rates and the housing cycle, unemployment rates, and tariffs (awaiting Supreme Court ruling and alternative paths the administration could take).

2025 to 2030 are Bernstein estimates Source: eMarketer, Bernstein estimates and analysis

As AI platforms become more deeply ingrained in our lives, they promise to reshape the consumer Internet ecosystem not only around how we search, but also how we transact. At the same time, consumer behavior is not easy to change. US eCommerce hovering at 18% of total retail sales three decades after the founding of eBay.com tells us as much. The experience will need to be demonstrably better than the status quo. 2026 will bring more experimentation. Consumers will continue using AI as a research tool, and we will probably see early trials of AI channels to transact. And in the initial stages, consumers may find themselves engaging more with onsite AI tools (e.g., Amazon's Rufus is on track to deliver $10B+ of annualized GMV while AI traffic from Chatbots remains sub-1% of total traffic currently). But we see room for AI tools to push product recommendations, which could open up more surface areas for engagement and monetization over time ('seeking information' growing fast within ChatGPT usage).

For third-party AI chatbots to truly take off in an eCommerce setting, the capabilities and integrations need to get better. Consumers also need to build the habit of product search and ultimately trust these channels with their transactions. To that end, we are seeing progress and the experience will only improve from here. In September, OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in partnership with Etsy, Shopify, and Walmart, followed by Apps within ChatGPT in early October. Then in late November, the company released Shopping Research and Alphabet launched AI shopping updates ahead of the holiday season. Alphabet is also rolling out Agentic Checkout and recently announced its Universal Commerce Protocol in partnership with various eCommerce and payments providers. Automation of search, discovery, and purchase decisions is likely when we see that 10x improvement to the consumer experience, even for the more mundane purchases that have become effortless in an Amazon-world.

The most notable eCommerce omission in all these partnership agreements is Amazon. The company has reportedly blocked any attempt to scrape inventory, which poses an interesting question - can OpenAI and Google scale Agentic Commerce without Amazon? For the likes of Walmart, Wayfair, Etsy, eBay, and others this is positive (for as long as it lasts). They can vie to fill the void left by the eCommerce giant. Conversely, if these third-party channels do see more material uptake in 2026, does Amazon feel pressured to participate and risk disintermediation?

Amazon accounts for 40% of US eCom, 50%+ of product searches, and likely 60%+ of product SKUs available for sale online. The absence of Amazon participation in third-party AI chatbot may well be the equivalent of opening a department store with half the shelves empty. Do you return to the store? And yet, reports suggests that ~20% of product referrals on AI chatbots still click out to Amazon, and how many of you readers have done some product research on ChatGPT only to the copy the search over on Amazon and check out? If Amazon can turbocharge on-site/app search with Rufus, Alexa+, and Buy For Me, it's hard to argue that consumers will change their product search behavior away from the retail giant.

If our general framing around experimentation is right, then 2026 will remain a year of theoretical debates around how eCommerce search could evolve and be re-shaped by AI . Investors will be left to extrapolate relatively small numbers around the percentage of consumers engaging with AI tools or incremental GMV from AI recommendations to longer-term outcomes on GMV mix and direct/indirect traffic implications. Changes at the top-of-the-funnel invite longer-term questions for retail media dollars, a core profit pool.

In an Agentic Commerce future, there is risk of disintermediation for the marketplaces we cover, but that also assumes an eCommerce pie that is static and a lack of evolution from the current platforms. We can only stress that it's very early and a lot has to fall into place before we get a clear picture on winners/losers in a paradigm shift. Our current thinking favors models that have a high degree of loyalty, unique content, a right to win across multiple variables, and limited dependency on advertising dollars to support profitability. As such, we think Amazon is most resilient, but has a lot to lose if ad dollars are disintermediated, while we think Wayfair's downside is capped (small advertising business today). The longer tail platforms (e.g., Etsy and eBay) may benefit from greater awareness of their inventory.

We would expect AI-supported eCommerce GMV to represent a LSD % of US eCommerce in 2026E. Amazon is our proxy here, with Rufus supporting $10B of annualized GMV or ~1% of estimated company-wide GMV today. If we assume Rufussupported-GMV can scale quickly, say to a run-rate of $20B or $30B by YE26 (extrapolating recent interaction and MAU growth rates), then it would represent 2-3% of Amazon's eCommerce base exiting the year. In a similar vein, as consumers experiment, third-party integrations should also start to contribute through the year. As far as narratives go, the moment these companies can point to '1ppt of acceleration from AI', the Street can start to dream about AI-driven positive revisions to growth expectations. Etsy will be an interesting name to watch given: (1) it has jumped into these partnerships; (2) AI tools are often used for gift giving; and (3) weakness in core demand means it might be easier for smaller levels of traffic to move the needle.

I never get the question: 'What's not going to change in 10 years?' In our business, we know that customers want low prices and I know that's going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery, they want vast selection.' - Jeff Bezos

As automation and newer logistics models allow for greater efficiencies and quicker delivery, eCommerce adoption should continue to grow - especially in a category like grocery where items are perishable. 2026 looks to be a year of convergence between Amazon, which is improving delivery speed from 2-day to 1-day to Same Day, and the on-demand models in DoorDash, Instacart, and Uber, which leverage existing retail infrastructure and gig labor models to shrink delivery windows to minutes/hours. As Amazon pushes into grocery (a strategic priority for the on-demand marketplaces) and the likes of DoorDash and Uber expand into broader retail (a stronghold of Amazon), they will compete more. While small relative to Amazon, they are scaling quickly - we estimate $24B in US New Verticals GMV at DoorDash in 2026E and $40B at Instacart.

In terms of real world applications of AI, robotics and automation should unlock greater network efficiencies. In particular, Amazon has made great strides on this front, having acquired Kiva back in 2012 and then accelerating efforts during the pandemic when there was a shortage of workers. Amazon is now leveraging 1M+ robots, up from 350K in 2021, with ~75% of products handled by a robot at least once in the supply chain. Blue Jay, a new robot being tested in South Carolina, can pick, pack, stow, and consolidate ~75% of items onsite. Over the next several years, we also expect to see last mile delivery costs improve as drones and AVs are integrated into logistics networks.

A highly recurring category, grocery is one of Amazon's final frontiers in eCommerce. It's also a category that becomes more accessible if the company can sustainably meet same-day delivery expectations (economically), building off years of investment into its logistics network. Management is making another concerted effort in grocery in 2026, with a combination of approaches: (1) Amazon recently expanded Same-Day grocery delivery benefits to 2.3K cities , with more markets coming this year (delivery windows broadly appear to be within 5 hours and possibly 2 hours for select regions); and (2) It is also testing 30-minute delivery windows in Seattle and Philadelphia via a service called Amazon Now.

Same Day was a competitive offering on price, but lagged on selection and speed. Amazon Now closes the gap on the speed in relation to DoorDash, Instacart, and Uber - and of course Walmart, which has BOPIS capabilities. Pick/pack speed and efficiency are core advantages of the third-party models. 75% of Instacart's delivery orders are 'on-demand' with a median delivery time under 90 minutes. We estimate Priority accounts ~40% of total Instacart orders, with average delivery times under 60min (and 25% of these Priority orders are delivered in less than 30min).

The scalability of this effort from Amazon comes back to two key variables from our point of view: (1) the depth of SKU count ('thousands' of items noted across popular staples and fresh categories vs. the third-party platforms offering the full grocery store); and (2) the economics of this model without leveraging higher prices/more fee revenue. Our understanding is that Same Day grocery is being built upon the existing fulfillment and logistics network. Bundling groceries (with other deliveries) can get the economics to work. Quick-service, on-demand is a different ask, and likely requires building a base of gig workers + greater network density. The ad business will help Amazon immensely with supporting grocery margins.

While Amazon is big and scary, our fundamental view on Instacart is that of 'shrinking slices and growing pies'. Grocery is a massive market (>$1T TAM) and is under-penetrated from a digital adoption perspective (low-to-mid teens % of GMV is online today). The logistics and selection advantages that platforms like Instacart have further added value for consumers and differentiate the offering vs. Walmart/Amazon. Amazon can never be taken lightly and grocery eCommerce is a battleground vertical in 2026. But we also expect Amazon's efforts in the category to be a positive catalyst for deeper partnerships between the third-party platforms and grocers , which will now need a stronger online offering to compete. DoorDash and Uber benefit (expanding partnerships with the likes of Kroger and Aldi are examples of this).

Amazon continues to be the dominant force in US eCommerce. However, it's not the only game in town. Along with Amazon, we have seen Shopify (not covered by Bernstein) backed companies (proxy for DTC) and Walmart (covered by Zhihan Ma) take share , with big box retailers broadly continuing to invest more behind their digital storefronts. And of course, more recently, Temu and Shein have scaled quickly to capture low-single-digit market share as well, though their momentum slowed in 2025 due to tariffs and geopolitical tension.

Scale begets scale, and we expect the big to get bigger, particularly in a competitive environment where eCommerce companies need to continue making investments on multiple fronts (e.g., across AI tools and more robust logistics). The top online retailers and marketplaces (i.e., backing out Shopify GMV) accounted for 73% of the US eCommerce market in 2025. This was up ~19ppts from 54% in 2016, and we think the directional trend continues. At the company-level, it's worth noting that recent divergences in market share partly reflect category dynamics (e.g., home goods has been under pressure, weighing on Wayfair and Etsy) while the more diversified and less discretionary platforms have powered through this period (e.g., Amazon and Walmart). EXHIBIT 22: A longer-term historical lookback illustrates the aggregation of eCommerce GMV amongst the top platforms.

US eCommerce stocks largely performed well in 2025 with Wayfair and Carvana (not covered) leading the way. Amazon was the notable laggard, albeit the story there has morphed into one driven more by AWS and AI workloads than the company's eCommerce business, which continues to hum along nicely (discussed more below). Etsy aside, the group was driven by positive revisions to both revenue and EBITDA forecasts. Thus, while eCommerce growth rates have lagged other end-markets in Internet (e.g., Cloud, Digital Ads, Rideshare, Food Delivery), the rate of change and direction of travel on estimates have been tailwinds for the stocks. Early days, but the price momentum has continued into 2026.

Amazon's disappointing stock performance in 2025 was largely a referendum on Cloud sentiment and the Agentic commerce disruption narratives. However, Amazon's retail business, after a volatile 1H due to tariffs and macro concerns, was solid in 2025. Online store growth was stable, unit sales continued growing faster than shipping costs, AI shopping chatbots shipped and started picking up traction through the holiday season, and headlines around expansion of same-day delivery, a grocery push, project Leo ramping, cost-cutting efforts, and robotics/automation progress have sowed the seeds of a compelling longer-term narrative - let's get this party going in 2026.

We believe Amazon is well set-up to maintain stable retail growth in 2026. With a solid 4Q guide dismissing any lingering macro- or tariff-related impacts, we see the Online Stores business growing at ~8% in 2026. We see EBIT margin improvement for the Retail & Other segment tied to ongoing improvements in cost of fulfillment from both extensive investments in expanding the distribution center network and robotics efforts. There could also be upside from the grocery push which appears to be prioritizing same-day bundling that could well drive higher net OI dollars despite being margin dillutive on a per widget based. We also believe the fears of AI product search disruption are overdone with a heavy slate of expected AI shopping assistants product launches this year are not too dissimilar from where Google was at the start of last year if consumers go to Amazon to search for products, and these searches are turbo-charged with AI via Rufus integration that increases conversion rates and expands products

available-for-sale off Amazon... it's hard to see why consumers change their behavior to go off of Amazon. The ads business continues to outperform , showing acceleration for 3 straight quarters, comfortably beating expectations. While the bulk of growth was still driven by product/branded search on the retail side, greater advertiser adoption of AI tools helped drive improved ad performance. While still relatively small, the DSP and Prime Video ads businesses continue to scale well along with partnerships with Roku and Netflix (covered by Laurent Yoon). The full funnel advertising offering also continues to see strength with an audience of 300M in the US across owned and operated properties as well as 3 rd -party properties. We model 20%+ Advertising revenue growth in FY26 along with stable high margins, with growth moderating through FY26 and 27.

AWS. The tables finally started turning on AWS sentiment following blowout 3Q growth with stronger-than-anticipated revenue acceleration and strong guidance alongside an OpenAI partnership that was a year or so too late - to our surprise the stock mostly round-tripped from the earnings beat. Why? The bear case we hear is that AWS' position in AI cloud remains behind peers, and we can thank Google's exceptional Q4 performance, product shipments, and partnership announcements as the new kid in town.

Yet AWS returned to capturing the most amount of incremental net-new cloud dollars amongst the hyperscalers in Q4 , and we are steadfast on the near-term belief that cloud revenues will track closely with new capacity been brought online as supply constraints remain heavy. Key guidance included AWS having added 3.8 GW of capacity in the 12 months ending 3Q as well as another 1 GW coming online in 4Q, and AWS having double capacity from 2022 to 2025, with another doubling expected by 2027. Project Rainier also came online at the start of Q4 and ramped aggressively through the end of the quarter from 500k to 1M Trainium chips, with Anthropic's revenue contribution to AWS from both training and inferencing ramping and expected to grow significantly.

We expect AWS acceleration to continue and surprise to the upside, especially over the next 3-4 quarters given relatively weak comps and strong capacity adds . We do see some margin compression tied mostly to elevated depreciation charges related to investments, primarily short-dated assets within AWS, but margins should still hold up in the low-to-mid 30% range in the long-term. CapEx. FY25 CapEx guidance was raised pretty much every quarter through the year, landing on $135B. While we don't have concrete guidance on FY26 CapEx beyond it going up further, AWS' plan to double capacity again by 2027 provides some framework to think about the intensity of AWS-related CapEx through the next couple of years.

Barring any unforeseen macro or policy shocks, we think the set-up is positive near-term, driven mostly by continued AWS acceleration, retail margin expansion, a growing ad business, stable retail growth with possible AI-tailwinds to GMV expansion, and smaller positive catalysts including LEO going commercial, Zoox service expansion, and robotics/drone delivery headline ramp.

Wayfair stock more than doubled in 2025 as the company delivered accelerating revenue growth and substantial EBITDA upside - and it has continued to run to start 2026 as the market anticipates a favorable outcome on the Supreme Court tariff ruling. We were particularly impressed with Q3 results, which delivered more convincing share gain from our vantage point (vs. prior quarters) and further expense discipline. We like the story but feel the stock has run away from us as it gets priced for an increasingly optimistic outlook. We suspect the buy-side bar has now climbed above sell-side expectations, which look largely achievable given recent growth rates and margin expansion. Much of this will hinge on revenue growth. Growing at MSD vs. HSD has an impact on EBTIDA flow-through and revisions vs. Street expectations. We think the set-up is probably still favorable near-term, but could get tougher as the comps becoming more challenging beyond Q2.

· Stabilizing revenue backdrop. While the industry remains tough to call and hard to bank on as a core thesis near-term, it certainly feels like we are exiting the year on better footing than how we started it, with furniture retail sales growing LSD to MSD in 2025. Replacement cycle? Tariffs, to our surprise, proved to be a non-issue last year and Wayfair's model has been more resilient than we expected. We forecast ~6% revenue growth in 2026, with the US growing 5% and International 11% off a smaller base. Having recently re-rated, the stock will be sensitive to revenue acceleration/deceleration dynamics.

· Monitoring share gains. If the category continues to bounce along the bottom, further improving growth will come down to Wayfair's share spread. Beyond the core recipe of pricing, product availability, and convenience, incremental drivers of share spread this year will likely be newer programs like Rewards and Verified, as well as GenAI initiatives (a combination of onsite and partnership efforts). On the AI front, we think Wayfair is in a good position to compete near-term - Amazon isn't participating in 3P channels yet and Wayfair has more category depth + tech talent vs. pureplay furniture peers.

· An Incremental margin story...tied to revenue growth. Incremental margins in the mid-to-high teens relative to a 6% EBITDA margin level translates to expansion, particularly if revenue beats Street expectations. We expect $855M in Adjusted EBITDA in 2026, slightly ahead of consensus. Profit outcomes for Wayfair are tied closely to growth, with fixed costs to stay flattish. If the business grows closer to 8%, we can outline a reasonable upside case of ~$900M+ in Adjusted EBITDA, particularly since higher organic demand could lead to stronger contribution margins. But, the opposite is also true if growth moderates to the LSD-to-MSD range, then EBITDA growth could slow.

· Can Wayfair make case for structurally higher margins? SOTG&A discipline is now better appreciated by investors. However, if Wayfair can move the needle on Gross Margin, which has settled around ~30% in recent periods, then it would reignite the bull case around structurally better long-term margins. Gross Margin is a critical lever in the company's plan to generate Adj. EBITDA margins >10%. Supplier advertising (likely 1.5-2% of revenue today) is probably the most meaningful driver of Gross Margin expansion from here (targeting 3-4% penetration).

eBay followed up a solid 2024 with a strong 2025, and the stock was rewarded for it. But it was almost...too good? A bizarre comment to make outside the context of stocks, but the high-class problem facing eBay has become one of GMV and EBIT growth durability. GMV growth hit 8% Y/Y in 3Q25 on an FxN basis, with the US business growing 13% - rates that felt completely out of reach at the start of the year. While it's easy to point to category tailwinds, the fact that eBay is participating in this growth is also a sign of progress. However, the 2025 strength sets up a conundrum for the stock tactically in 2026. Lapping these comps, particularly in 2H, will not be easy and tailwinds could turn into headwinds if a segment like Collectibles rolls over. Couple that with a lack of firm commitment on margin expansion (so far), and the set-up feels a bit tricky.

· Collectibles and P&A power GMV. eBay's robust GMV trends could continue near-term. We think 4Q25 and 1Q26 could be strong quarters, led by Collectibles and P&A. That said, Y/Y trends will likely start to decelerate 2Q26 onward at the comps toughen materially - it's plausible that US GMV growth almost flattens out Y/Y in 2H26. We estimate that Collectibles and P&A (the two largest contributors to growth) drove >3ppt out of 8ppts of total FxN GMV growth in 3Q25 and some of this strength may not persist (e.g., Pokémon cards saw triple-digit growth while Q4 appears to be buoyed by strength in other Collectibles like Gold and Silver coins). eBay has already highlighted ~2ppts of a likely headwind from tougher compares and ad auction benefits rolling off, plus ~1ppt from de minimis. To be fair, this dynamic is

also known now and reflected. · Can eBay highlight a broadening out of GMV strength? Our understanding is that these headwinds were sized in isolation, before taking into account positive tailwinds from product initiatives (e.g., eBay Live, Caramel, Facebook Marketplace integration), Focus Category expansion, and further solutions for cross-border efforts. Formal guidance, which we expect on the 4Q25 call, could offer a more positive spin with headwinds and tailwinds netted out. For example, Caramel and Marketplace could scale to drive >1ppt of incremental GMV in 2026 Y/Y. With Focus Categories growing 15% FxN in 3Q25, we believe eBay has seen acceleration across other core categories, which is an encouraging sign. This strength in other Focus Category buckets will need to sustain for the bull case to have legs in 2026.

· Mindful of margin trade-offs. Recent GMV strength was met with more substantial reinvestment, capping margin upside. For now, we have kept our margin outlook largely flattish in 2026 on a Y/Y basis, with EBIT dollars growing 6%. Similar to the revenue dynamic, we are awaiting greater clarity from management on the EBIT outlook for 2026 (expected on the 4Q25 call). If there is going to be margin upside, it would likely be in persistent S&M leverage (particularly if Amazon stays out of the ad auctions) and showing leverage on fixed cost investments (R&D looks like it was pulled forward in 2025). But it's also possible that the GMV upside continues to get recycled into product and customer acquisition efforts. Our sense is that EBIT dollars remain the focus, with margin outcomes more of an output, so we're not banking on much expansion yet.

Etsy stock found slightly better footing in 2025 after a challenging 2023/24, but it continues to be a volatile name. GMS remains the primary KPI in question as the company tries to get itself back on a path of consistent growth. We think 4Q25 will showcase positive Y/Y trends for the first time in years (for core Etsy.com), but the comps are also easy and remain so into 1Q26. The 2-year stack has shown little progress in recent quarters, making us more wary of positive GMS growth into 2H26. New CEO, Kruti Patel Goyal, will look to put Etsy on a better trajectory - and the key variable we care about is frequency (GMS per Buyer will be the core proxy we can track on a quarterly basis). For us, Etsy remains in the neutral camp until we can gain greater confidence in the turnaround - to that end, it'll be interesting to see if the company reverts to providing annual guidance again in 2026 now that the business has stabilized a bit.

· Expanding upon the buyer experience. While Etsy has historically been relatively effective at capturing the purchase you knew you wanted, it has been less effective at driving consideration and encouraging new purchase occasions (across more categories). The effort to collect more data, embed more personalization in the content you see on the site and through targeting efforts, and free up digital real estate for consideration, started under Josh and looks to be continuing under Kruti. We agree that this is the right area to focus, but the task at hand isn't easy. The company has pointed to early greenshoots (e.g., personalized content in email and push notifications receiving positive GMS responses), but we need to see greater flow-through to GMS against more normal compares (or on a 2YR stack basis). An initial return to positive GMS growth is probably enough for the stock in the short-term, but long-term value creation will likely hinge on the company's ability to return to industry levels of growth again, which is re-approaching HSD

levels. · Can AI expand Etsy's audience? Etsy has been an early adopter of AI integrations, partnering with ChatGPT on Instant Checkout, and more recently Gemini and Copilot. The appeal is consideration - surfacing the platform's subset of unique, long tail inventory when it may have otherwise never been part of the consideration set to begin with. The company pays a small referral fee on transactions that are generated through Instant Checkout (we estimate LSD % of GMV), which we suspect is quite economical considering customer acquisition costs through other paid channels and the pay-on-conversion structure of this arrangement. Longer-term, as consumer behavior and commercial arrangements evolve, Etsy will likely need to contend with the implications for onsite advertising, which drives the bulk of margin today. If Etsy can point to and size incremental GMS from these AI channels in the coming quarters, we can see it being a positive catalyst for the stock.
