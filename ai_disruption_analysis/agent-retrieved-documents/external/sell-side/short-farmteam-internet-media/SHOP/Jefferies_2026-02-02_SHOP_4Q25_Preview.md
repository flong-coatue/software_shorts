We expect 4Q fundamentals to be solid, as 3P data points to a beat vs. consensus on GMV and total rev. We also expect EBIT upside as a result of opex control. On guidance, EBIT and FCF margin commentary are in focus, as investors would like more expansion in 2026 following a muted 2025. Beyond fundamentals, addressing the impact of agentic commerce on SHOP's competitive positioning and fundamentals will likely dictate the stock's price action. Financial Expectations (2/11 BMO). We expect GMV of $121B (+28% y/y) vs consensus

of $121.4B. Our total rev forecast of $3,573M is slightly below consensus of $3,597M and implies growth of ~27%, in line with guidance for mid- to high-twenties y/y growth. Our estimate consists of MS rev of $2,821M (+31% y/y, consensus: $2,832M) and Sub rev of $752M (+13% y/y, consensus: $764M). Our MRR estimate of $199M (+12% y/y) is slightly below consensus of $200M. We forecast a flat q/q MS take rate (2.33%). We expect GAAP gross margins of 46.6%, in-line with the Street and guidance for low-twenties % y/y GP$ growth (JEFe: +23% y/y). We expect GAAP op mgns of 16.1%, ahead of consensus of 15.9% and in-line with guidance for opex to represent 30-31% of revenue.

Room for Upside to GMV Expectations. Consensus for GMV growth of ~29% y/y (total rev: +28% y/y) for 4Q25 implies a ~32% q/q increase, below 4Q24 (+35%) and 4Q23 (+34%). We see room for upside to consensus expectations based on solid BFCM data (see our recap here) and robust consumer spending despite wavering sentiment (UMich: -10% q/q in 4Q25).

Expecting Solid Topline Guidance, Mixed Profitability. We see upside to Street expectations for 1Q26 GMV of $94.7B (+27% y/y) and total rev of $2,964M (+26% y/y). On profitability, we expect GMs to remain constrained as SHOP manages the growth contribution mix shift towards Merchant Solutions rev from Sub rev as well as higher hosting costs driven by increased volumes, int'l expansion, and rising AI usage costs. On opex, we believe investments in new growth segments will be offset by flat/lower headcount and continued expense discipline across the business. Consensus expectations for 1Q26 GAAP gross mgns of 48.9% and op mgns of 10.5% (38.3% opex % of rev) are above our forecasts for 48.1% and 9.9%, respectively.

Implications of 4% Fee to OpenAI. Since it was announced that SHOP merchants will have to pay a 4% fee for checking out via OpenAI's Instant Checkout, it has concerned investors that the channel may not be as profitable for merchants and may make them less likely to utilize it. Encouragingly, SHOP has established relationships with GOOGL and MSFT, and we believe it remains an agentic commerce beneficiary. Beyond the economics, investors also want more clarity on the potential competitive risk following reports of AMZN investing in OpenAI. Clarity on Several Developments within the Sales Org. SHOP announced on 12/2 that it will restructure its sales compensation, which will now be based on a three-year quota system intended to compound over years vs. quarters. We expect mgmt to detail any associated change to the recognition of sales commissions and any potential ST impact to op mgns. We also expect SHOP to address the restructuring of its partnership org and any associated RIF.

Shopify provides a cloud-based e-commerce platform for merchants of all sizes, with a particular focus on SMBs. Merchants can use Shopify to build and manage their online businesses and sell across multiple channels and devices. The company also offers Shopify Plus, a more robust version of its platform targeted at larger merchants. Shopify was founded in 2004, became public in 2015, and is headquartered in Ontario, Canada. Valuation. Our $160 price target is based on our DCF analysis. Risks include competition, the macro environment, a significant mix shift back to brick and mortar, and a rapid rise in interest rates.

Recommendation Published February 2, 2026 19:56 P.M. Recommendation Distributed February 2, 2026 19:56 P.M.

Jefferies' methodology for assigning ratings may include the following: market capitalization, maturity, growth/value, volatility and expected total return over the next 12 months. The price targets are based on several methodologies, which may include, but are not restricted to, analyses of market risk, growth rate, revenue stream, discounted cash flow (DCF), EBITDA, EPS, cash flow (CF), free cash flow (FCF), EV/EBITDA, P/E, PE/growth, P/CF, P/FCF, premium (discount)/average group EV/EBITDA, premium (discount)/average group P/E, sum of the parts, net asset value, dividend returns, and return on equity (ROE) over the next 12 months.

Jefferies Franchise Picks include stock selections from among the best stock ideas from our equity analysts over a 12 month period. Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a 15% stop loss, and the remainder will have a 20% stop. Franchise Picks are not intended to represent a recommended portfolio of stocks and is not sector based, but we may note where we believe a Pick falls within an investment style such as growth or value.

This report was prepared for general circulation and does not provide investment recommendations specific to individual investors. As such, the financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own investment decisions based upon their specific investment objectives and financial situation utilizing their own financial advisors as they deem necessary. Past performance of the financial instruments recommended in this report should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future results.

Should there be fluctuations in the exchange rate after this

date, that will affect the non-US target prices and should no longer be relied upon. In addition, investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of the underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
