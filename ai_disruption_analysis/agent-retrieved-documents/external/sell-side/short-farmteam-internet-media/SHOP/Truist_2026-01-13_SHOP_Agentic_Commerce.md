✓ Deep Dive Report ✓ Agentic Commerce Development

SHOP - Laying the Groundwork for the Next Chapter of Agentic Commerce; Introduces UCP: Conversational AI Checkout Based on our attendance & discussions at the National Retail Federation's conference in NYC this week, we believe Shopify is positioned to become the operating system for agentic commerce following the launch of the Universal Commerce Protocol. We believe Shopify's long-standing advantage of delivering a seamless checkout across channels extends naturally into agent-driven shopping, enabling merchants to transact across LLM platforms w/o added complexity & reinforces a multi-year oppty as commerce interfaces evolve. While we remain Hold rated (valuation oriented), we are incrementally confident in Shopify's positioning as a potential share gainer in agentic commerce.

Pattern Recognition: Shopify Has Been Consistently Ahead of the Curve on Emerging Trends in Commerce: Is Agentic the Next One They Will Capitalize On? In our view, Shopify has a track record of being early in predicting the emergence of new retail shopping interfaces. Historically, the company has been early to mobile, social, and embedded commerce channels, and its core competitive differentiation has remained constant: the ability to deliver a seamless checkout experience wherever the customer is. As shopping behavior shifts toward agent-driven interactions, we believe Shopify's channel-agnostic strategy positions it well to capitalize on agentic commerce by partnering broadly across large language model platforms rather than focusing on a single ecosystem. By simplifying channel complexity, centralizing merchant catalogs, and standardizing checkout/order logic, we believe Shopify can function as the operating system for merchants selling through agentic channels, reinforcing its role as critical infrastructure as the commerce landscape continues to evolve.

Introducing Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP): Laying the Groundwork for Agentic Checkout. In conjunction with NRF, Shopify and Google (GOOGL, Buy, Squali) announced that they have co-developed a new open standard for agentic commerce called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP). This standardized transaction layer lets AI agents move seamlessly from product discovery to checkout inside conversational interfaces while preserving merchant-specific catalogs, pricing, loyalty, and checkout logic. We believe UCP is the introduction of a bridge from conversational AI to real-time commerce as agents transition from answering questions to completing transactions. Shopify has

highlighted that over the past year, large language models became effective at product discovery and recommendations, but the experience ended at checkout with consumers having to navigate away from conversational windows to make purchases. With the introduction of the UCP, Shopify is enabling agents to move from discovery all the way through payment, completing transactions inside platforms like Google without forcing users to click out to a traditional website. This effectively turns conversations into conversions, in our opinion. At the core of this effort is Shopify's push to embed merchant catalogs and checkout logic across the broader digital ecosystem. Merchants no longer need to manage separate integrations for Google (Gemini or AI-mode search), ChatGPT (Private), Copilot (MSFT, Buy), or future agentic platforms as Shopify handles the complexity once and distributes it throughout the ecosystem. Importantly, UCP is designed to accommodate the real-world complexity of commerce where loyalty programs, promotions, and custom checkout logic

Further, Shopify believes its architectural advantage comes from its opinionated data model and unified platform approach. Product catalogs, pricing, availability, and checkout logic are standardized, kept up to date via APIs, and extended where merchants need custom logic. The company has highlighted that this avoids staleness and inconsistency that comes from agents scraping blogs or webpages. Additionally, if a transaction becomes too complex for an autonomous agent, the UCP now allows a human to step in and assist the conversion process while protecting brand experience and compliance.

Over time, Shopify sees UCP expanding beyond pure retail use cases into other industries with complex purchasing workflows, specifically highlighting travel as a natural extension. The company is also opening the protocol to developers and non-Shopify merchants, allowing them to adopt Shopify's data model and sell through agentic channels even if they don't run their core storefront on Shopify. Importantly, the merchant remains the merchant of record, retains the customer relationship, and receives the order directly into their existing systems, a process we believe allows Shopify to maintain its role as the infrastructure for commerce rather than a marketplace operator. What we don't know yet are what type of incremental economics that could be involved with agentic commerce and executing actual commerce transactions through various LLMs and conversational AI interfaces. Given the size, scale and leverage Shopify likely would have with AI partner ecosystems, we assume the company could be well positioned to capture value/economics in this rapidly evolving area.

Customer Feedback on UCP. At NRF, customers were interested in the effort required for non-Shopify merchants to participate in agentic commerce. Shopify clarified that onboarding a non-Shopify merchant typically takes several weeks as Shopify helps these merchants standardize their catalog data and provides them with the ability to sell across multiple agentic channels through a separate plan. For existing Shopify merchants, these capabilities are built directly into the platform with no additional integration work required.

Customers were also interested in how agentic channels will surface in terms of distribution. Shopify indicated that agentic channels will soon appear as selectable sales channels within the platform, allowing merchants to opt in with a toggle rather than managing individual integrations across AI platforms. Additionally, customers were curious about brand visibility and product promotion in agentdriven environments calling out that traditional SEO mechanics are no longer present in agentic discovery. Shopify acknowledged that agentic interfaces will increasingly favor in-conversation commerce experiences over outbound links, suggesting that merchandising and promotion will shift toward native placement and buying experiences inside AI interactions.

Based in Ottawa, Canada, Shopify Inc. (SHOP) is a leading digital commerce vendor serving the needs of entrepreneurs, small businesses, enterprises, and fast-growing consumer brands that strive to sell goods and services across all key channels, including web storefronts, social media sites, buy buttons on mobile apps and website blogs and brick and mortar settings. The company's cloud-based solutions have proven to scale to high gross merchandise volume (GMV) customer needs; the company's much higher price point Shopify Plus SKU is directly targeted at merchants selling millions of dollars of GMV on a monthly basis. Along with SaaS-based software, the company provides accompanying merchant solutions for its customers that include payment processing, shipping and cash advances.

Longer term, we think Shopify represents a solid fundamental story with attractive growth prospects in the secularly-oriented digital commerce space as well as off-line commerce and omni-channel emerging growth engines. While the company has benefited from international expansion, continued adoption of its product offerings and numerous emerging growth drivers, we are cautious on the company's near-term outlook stemming from a variety of macro headwinds, including global tariffs impacting supply and demand factors for the company's merchants served and softer consumer spend trends globally as a result of a persistent weakened economy. Thus, we rate the shares Hold.

Valuation. Our $155 PT is based on a 10-year DCF, with assumptions that include a 10-year revenue CAGR of 22% (21% before), a 3% terminal revenue growth rate, a 22x terminal FCF multiple, a 27% terminal FCF margin, and a 9.5% WACC. Risks to our rating and price target: Upside risks include continued resilience of end consumer spend, upside surprises to GMV and top-line growth coming in much better than forecast and profits and cash flow improving much faster than expected. Downside risks include macro headwinds and geopolitical upheaval, tariffs impacting merchant product manufacturing costs, softer consumer spend dynamics, macro complications leading to pushed out enterprise deal timelines, SMB reliance, investments and/or acquisitions that impact operating leverage and increased model complexity with fast-growing lower margin merchant solutions.

Catalysts: Tariff relief/new trade deals, stronger than expected consumer spend trends, new customer acquisition momentum, off-line commerce traction, higher ARPU Shopify Plus product traction, merchant solution add-ons, upmarket expansion etc.
