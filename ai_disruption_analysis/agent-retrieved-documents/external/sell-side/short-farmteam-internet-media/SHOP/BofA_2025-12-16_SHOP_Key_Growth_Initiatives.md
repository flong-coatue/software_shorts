Price objective basis & risk Shopify, Inc. (SHOP) Our $190 PO represents 75x our CY27 FCF estimate. The 75x multiple represents 2.6x adjusted for 29% 2 year growth CAGR, a premium to the large cap software group trading at 1.2x 23% growth for durability of 25%+ growth. Downside risks are: A lower customer renewal rate (75-80%) compared to the broader cloud applications market, averaging in the high eighties given the focus on the SMB market segment. Higher attrition may limit growth as the dollar attrition amount increases. High exposure to the macroeconomic cycle in both the applications subscription and payments businesses, driven by consumer discretionary spend. Tariff induced reductions in demand trends also represent risks to topline growth.

Shopify, Inc. Delivering solid growth across all customer segments We are raising our PO to $ 190 from $185 following solid results. The stock is priced to perfection (trading at 13 x CY27 sales), though the company delivered on all key growth and margin metrics, and we view the stock reaction as sell the news. One question on investors ' minds has been, how long can GMV growth (+ 30 % y/y cc ) outpace industry growth in the low double digits . With solid growth across all key customer cohorts, sustainable share gains look increasingly likely . While early stages, s trength in the enterprise stands out. Attractive pric ing and rapid time to value , paired with an increasingly well-developed SI channel, paves the way for Shopify to gain share in the massive enterprise segment for years to come. Reiterate Buy. Merchant solutions continue to outpace GMV Investors are also questioning the runway for merchant solutions rev growth outpacing GMV growth. In 3Q , merchant solutions growth of 38 % outpac ed GMV growth by 6 points, ke

eping pace with the recent delta. All key growth initiatives in this line item are working well - and with such a diversified set of levers , we do not see the growth trajectory slowing near term. Balanced growth and margin apparent in Q3 The debate on margin and customer acquisition costs has quieted, since Shopify has delivered several quarters of strong, consistent growth. These concerns typically resurface entering a macro slowdown when the expectation for rising CAC. Clearly, we are not at that point. With healthy 3Q results and 4Q guidance on margin , t he operating framework for opex scale to offset modest GM pressure (from higher payments mix) is alive and well. Consolidating specialty eCommerce with leading platform Our new PO of $190 represents 14.6x CY27 sales, or 0.7x adjusted for 22% growth, a premium to the large cap software group (at 7.6 x and 0. 5 x / 15 % growth ) . With growth levers firing, we see further upside to the multiple.

Shopify is likely to continue to consolidate the vast small business market of 5.2 million businesses in the US alone driven by growing awareness of its market leadership with a number of defensible competitive advantages. With the stock trading in line with the large software group on EV/C24 sales, we look for continued traction with new merchant solutions, such as Shopify app, Audiences, Capital and POS to drive GMV monetization (3.04% in Q1) and higher OpM from here.
