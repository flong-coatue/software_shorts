Lenskart is a distinctive play on shifting lifestyle dynamics and is largely insulated from macro headwinds. We believe it has the elements to be the EssilorLuxottica (global eyewear leader) from India, given Lenskart's leading position and fully integrated business model. However, at current levels the stock is fairly valued.

bigger: We believe businesses that build strong, sustainable barriers to entry can win market share in the long run. Lenskart's strategic focus on full vertical integration in manufacturing, its robust supply chain, and advanced technology, combined with operational efficiency in store expansion and customer engagement, positions it as a superior business model capable of competing successfully both locally and globally. Lenskart's strategy is similar to EssilorLuxottica. If executed well, Lenskart could achieve global scale with high profitability. Additionally, Lenskart operates like a technology-focussed brand, giving it another advantage over traditional offline players. However, unlike EssilorLuxottica, Lenskart has yet to establish strong branding for its lenses.

Earnings estimates: We expect Lenskart's India business to grow revenues by 23% annually in F27-30 (24% in 2HF26), ahead of the organized eyewear category, gaining market share while expanding EBITDA margins from 16% in F25 to 23.2% by F30. For its international business, we forecast revenues to grow 15% annually in F27-30 and EBITDA margins to improve from 17.3% in F25 to 22.5% by F30. In both businesses, we expect growth to be volume-driven. Valuations: On our estimates, the stock is trading at 37x F27e EV/EBITDA on consolidated financials, in line with the 38x average EV/EBITDA among best-in-class discretionary and retail peers in our coverage, including Titan, Dmart, Trent, Page, Vishal, FSN E-commerce, and Brainbees (range of 24-68x). Further multiple re-rating will depend on consistent upside surprises in growth and profitability.

Key upside risks: 1) higher-than-expected market share gains; 2) Lenskart is able to create smart glasses that are recognized globally; and 3) greater-than-expected margin improvement in international business. Key downside risks: 1) Slowdown in store expansion or deterioration in profitability metrics, would lead to the market losing fervor in Lenskart's volume-driven story; 2) weakness in international business; and 3) any restrictions on imports from China.

We assume faster revenue growth in India at a 26% CAGR, F25-30, owing to a faster pace of store openings and success in new innovations including smart glasses. International business benefits from strategies in India and rise at an 18% CAGR, F25-30. The faster top-line growth, along with operational efficiencies and higher inhouse manufacturing, result in EBITDA margins expanding to 24.2% in India by F30 (vs 23.2% in our base case) and 23.5% internationally (vs 22.5% in our base case).

Lenskart continues to gain market share. 1) India business revenues rise at a 23% CAGR, F27-30, with a higher 24% growth in F26 (similar to 1HF26 trends), 2) margins improve in both India and international businesses, 3) India EBITDA margins improve from 15.9% in F25 to 23.2% by F30, and 4) international EBITDA margins improve from 17.3% in F25 to 22.5%. Overall, we build in 20%, 28% and 32% revenue, EBITDA and net profit CAGRs over F25-30, respectively.

▪ Lenskart's strategic focus on full vertical integration in manufacturing, its robust supply chain, and advanced technology, combined with operational efficiency in store expansion and customer engagement, positions it as a superior business model capable of competing successfully both locally and globally. ▪ Lenskart is a distinctive play on shifting lifestyle dynamics and is largely insulated from macro headwinds. We believe if executed well, Lenskart could achieve global scale with high profitability. ▪ On our estimates, the stock is fairly valued vs best-in-class peers in our coverage. Further multiple re-rating will depend on consistent upside surprises in growth and profitability.

We assume the India business rises at a slower 18% CAGR over F25-30, slightly lower than the organized eyewear category. Network expansion slows down. International business growth remains lower than our base case at an 11% CAGR over F25-30 due to weaker demand conditions and slower network expansion. Consequently, margin expansion is also slower.

1) Given the large presence of unorganized players in the India eyewear market, we think Lenskart has an opportunity to increase its market share to double digits from the current level of 4-6%. The pace of increase remains key. 2) Lenskart has developed in-house manufacturing capabilities, enabling it to produce eyewear at lower costs than peers and keep a larger assortment of in-house innovation at a fast pace. 2) Lenskart has a centralised supply chain. Approximately 75% of its eyewear inventory is stored at its manufacturing facility, with only limited display items in its stores. This model allows the company to offer a wider assortment, similar to an e-commerce fulfilment model.

3) Lenskart operates an omni-channel business model with 2,270 stores in India and 679 internationally. Approximately 76% of the eyewear units sold in India and 97% internationally are booked in stores, as many online-influenced customers browse digitally and complete their purchases offline. In F25, customers accounting for 44.82% of Lenskart's revenues in India engaged with the company digitally within 90 days prior to completing their purchase. 4) Technology plays a critical role across Lenskart's operations, including customer engagement, supply chain, retail store management, post-order fulfilment, and internal business functions. Its objective is to enhance customer value proposition and operational efficiency.

1) We expect a large part of business growth to come from volume expansion driven by new customer acquisitions. Any slowdown in store expansion or deterioration in profitability metrics could lead to the market losing fervor in Lenskart's volume-driven story. 2) Risks from international exposure both from a sourcing and market perspective. Lenskart operates in 13 markets outside India, which cumulatively contributed 43% of F25 revenues. About 42% of its total purchases are sourced from China, which creates supply-chain risk. Operating across multiple geographies exposes Lenskart's business to political, legal, economic, and regulatory changes, as well as inflation and foreign exchange fluctuations. Compliance requirements in overseas jurisdictions continue to evolve. 3) Centralized operations carry the risk of single-point failure. In addition, given the high reliance on technology, any system failures could significantly impact Lenskart's business.

4) Other concerns include medical advancements in the eye care industry and challenges in attracting and retaining optometrists, opticians, and other vision care professionals. M

3+3 enablers of Lenskart's leading position in India's eyewear market: Launched in 2010 as an online business, Lenskart emerged as the market leader in the India eyewear category within a decade, surpassing Titan Eye, the former leader. We believe three key enablers drove its success: 1) Methodical execution of an omni-channel strategy - starting online and aggressively expanding offline; 2) Strong price-value proposition in a market that was largely unorganized (about three-fourths of the market); and 3) Focus on efficient sourcing and simplifying a complex supply chain.

Three additional enablers drove Lenskart's recent growth: 1) Vertically integrated, centralized business model with in-house manufacturing capabilities, enabling lower costs, faster innovation, and operational efficiencies across India and in international markets; 2) With 2,200+ Lenskart stores operating in 400+ cities in India, the company has shifted to a company-owned, company-operated (COCO) format, which currently accounts for about 85% of its network; and 3) Use of technology across operations, from manufacturing and store location strategy via geoanalytics to customer acquisition through the TangoEye platform, both online and offline.

How should one think about India eyewear's TAM? India's eyewear market is about US $9.2bn in terms of revenue, according to Redseer, with the organized players comprising about 24%. Lenskart has a 4-6% market share and is 2-3x the size of Titan Eye, the #2 player. We see significant potential for organized players to expand their networks and compete effectively with long-standing unorganized players. Currently, for every 1mn people, there are about 60 eyewear stores in India, vs 350-450 stores each in footwear, pharmacy, and electronics, and 1,000-1,200 stores in apparel & accessories and jewellery. Nevertheless, network expansion should be properly managed, in our view, to ensure market share gains do not compromise profitability. Lenskart's strategy of offering free eye tests, introducing fashion-focused and use-case innovations, and maintaining competitive pricing has helped create new demand among customer cohorts that previously did not seek vision correction.

Investments in manufacturing and supply chain capabilities have enabled the company to overcome the eyewear category's complex supply chain challenges and to scale in a cost-efficient manner. Lenskart has consistently stayed ahead of peers in leveraging technology across operations. Global expansion - was it required?: International expansion by Indian consumer brands has historically faced skepticism due to limited success stories. However, looking at the eyewear category, as well as the success of EssilorLuxottica - the global eyewear leader key drivers that can be attributed to EssilorLuxottica's success include a vertically integrated business model, market expansion, and strategic acquisitions. Lenskart's strategy is similar to EssilorLuxottica's, from building a fully integrated business model to adopting a global mindset. If executed well, we think its strategy can create a business that has global scale and calibre with high profitability. Additionally, Lenskart operates like a technology-focussed brand, which gives it another advantage vs traditional offline players. M

Lenskart catered to an international TAM of US$19.1bn, according to Redseer. Refractive errors remain a global issue, with prevalence of about 68% in Japan, 65% in Southeast Asia, 40% in the Middle East as of F25, also according to Redseer, and it expects these rates to continue increasing. Penetration of prescription eyewear is low globally - 69% in Japan, 40% in Southeast Asia, and 60% in the Middle East - driven by affordability challenges. Organized retail penetration is also limited, at just 28-30% in Southeast Asian markets. Globally, the eyewear category is also evolving into a fashion-driven lifestyle accessory, which we think creates additional growth opportunities. Lenskart has taken a multi-pronged approach to its international expansion.

1) Finding a solution to the complex supply chain: Lenskart can leverage its India-based supply chain to support its international expansion - both by supplying lenses, frames, and other raw materials to overseas facilities and by exporting finished products from India. The company is also setting up a new facility in Hyderabad, Telangana, to further increase supply to global markets. It also operates two regional facilities - in Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, established in 2022 and 2024, respectively - that manufacture prescription eyeglasses. Lenskart builds small regional facilities under a centralized supply chain model, enabling faster services and improved customer experience. In Singapore and the UAE, Lenskart offers next-day delivery from these regional facilities, while also fulfilling orders from India. Lenskart's international expansion strategy is calibrated, following a tiered approach that prioritizes refining operating models in each geography to align with local requirements before accelerating store additions. In 1HF26, its international revenue grew 26% YoY, led mainly by same-store sales growth (SSSG).

- 2) Tech capabilities to capitalize on market opportunity: The technology infrastructure developed by Lenskart's India-based team also supports its international operations, including websites, mobile applications, warehouse management systems, and AI-driven tools. Its AI-enabled Computer Vision platform, which analyses CCTV footage to optimize customer flow, improve conversion rates, and enhance SSSG, is deployed across its international stores, including Owndays. Lenskart also uses its network of 164 remote optometrists in India to provide remote optometry services to its 266 stores in Japan and Thailand. The company also has self-eye-test facilities in Japan. 3) Global brand for the global consumer: While Lenskart is a 'make in India' brand its international strategy is different. Lenskart's international presence, through the Lenskart and Owndays brands, follows a localized approach in merchandise design and assortment, marketing, and store experience that is tailored to each geography. Store locations are chosen based on where local customers shop, rather than targeting the Indian diaspora.

Singapore is an established market where Lenskart has achieved leadership. Saudi Arabia is still in the early phase of strategic investment, while Japan and Thailand are in the midstage, with expanding store networks and improving unit economics. M

The India eyewear market is not driven by the country's macro trends or demographics; it is a pure play on shifting lifestyles and increasing awareness of vision correction.

Unlike other consumer categories, the eyewear category is complex - i.e., high customization and precision requirements - and its fragmented supply chain, which involves importers, wholesalers, and distributors to procure frames and lenses, create scalability challenges for most players. The long customer journey, from eye tests to product fulfillment, adds further friction.

The number of refractive errors are rising in India, currently affecting 777mn people, according to Redseer. Redseer estimates this will reach to 943mn by F30, driven by lifestyle changes such as increased screen times, reduced outdoor activities, greater air pollution, and shorter sleep cycles. Eyewear penetration in India remains low at 35% (~53% in metro cities, 32% in T2+ cities) due to limited awareness, accessibility, and affordability of prescription eyeglasses. Lenskart management recently indicated that ~50% of the eye tests that it conducts are for customers undergoing their first eye exam. Moreover, organized players account for only 24% of the market given the limited presence of organized players.

The neighbourhood store potential: Offline retail accounted for ~75% of Lenskart's total sales volume in India during F25. India's optical retail market remains deeply underpenetrated, with a low supply density of ~60 optical stores per mn population, well below developed markets and even lower than India's store network density in other categories such as jewellery and apparel. This indicates significant opportunity for branded, standardized players such as Lenskart to expand. We note that Lenskart's retail network spans across 2,270 stores comparing well with Dominos India and Reliance Trends but lagging other high-reach neighbourhood formats such as Apollo Pharmacy and MedPlus.

Lenskart's store expansion strategy focuses on deepening penetration in metropolitan and Tier 1 cities while broadening reach in underpenetrated Tier 2+ markets. The company continues to increase store density in existing markets while selectively opening COCO stores in new geographies to deliver a consistent customer experience. This strategy aligns with its goal of addressing India's growing vision-care needs through an omni-channel model.

· Expanding into newer markets: Using its GeoIQ technology, the company has identified whitespace across 2,800+ unserved pincodes, or 65% of pincodes in its existing 431 cities, where fundamentals meet the profitability criteria. It has also pinpointed 2,000+ emerging towns where favorable demographics, rising incomes, and improving infrastructure are creating viable markets. Importantly, these new town expansions are not hurting payback timelines, according to management.

· Market densification - opportunity for another 2,000+ stores in existing pincodes: Even within pincodes where the brand already has a presence, the company sees room to add more stores. Current penetration stands at 1.8 stores per pincode in India's top 8 cities, 1.6 in the next 40 cities, and 1.2 across the remaining 375 cities. Management notes that opening new stores near existing ones has had a minimal cannibalistic impact, as reflected in the high SSSG of 15.7% in F25 and ~15% in 1HF26, alongside same-pincode sales growth (SPSG) of 20.6% in F25 and ~20% in 1HF26. Over the past five years, the company has tripled its M

store count and doubled revenue per store across town tiers, indicating that new stores are generating incremental demand rather than cannibalizing existing sales. For example, in Bengaluru, the company expanded from 106 stores in March 2023 to 169 stores in June 2025. Management believes there is potential to add at least one new store in each of its existing 1,517 pincodes, with higher potential in metros and large Tier 1 towns, representing opportunity to add 2,000+ stores and effectively double its current network within existing pincodes. The company plans to add 450 net stores in India during F26, representing 22% YoY network growth, significantly higher than the 282 stores it added in F25 and 369 in F24. Lenskart's focus remains on gaining market share, prioritizing growth in a specific pincode rather than just growth within the same store. We expect Lenskart to follow an accelerated network expansion strategy over the next few years, adding 450-500 new stores annually over the next five years.

Lenskart uses its proprietary geoanalytics platform, GeoIQ, to more accurately identify and expand its retail stores, with new stores achieving a payback period of 10-11 months across town tiers. Of the 703 COCO stores that opened during F23-24 and were active as of March 2025, 80.8% achieved payback by March 2025, with an average payback period of 10.29 months.

Despite being the market leader in India, Lenskart has only 4-6% market share. Even in some of its larger markets, we estimate Lenskart's share is likely in the high single digits to early double digits. We see opportunity for the company to gain market share in India, as seen globally. Market leaders tend to enjoy mid-high-double-digit market share in their key markets given the business model's complexity. For Lenskart, we think a large part of its growth will be volume-driven, as reflected in its 33% revenue CAGR over F23-25, which was led by a 30% volume CAGR. Premiumization will play out to some extent, but will likely be offset by new store additions.

A few of its initiatives to strengthen its business pillars include · Enhancing customer experience by using technology: ° Lenskart uses TangoEye to determine placement of products at stores. Product placement may vary from one store to the other. ° Lenskart recently launched a new lens-replacement initiative that allows customers to replace the lenses in their existing spectacles from any brand at attractive prices, helping it to acquire new customers. ° Improving delivery timelines. · Growing the store network by using GeoIQ · Maintaining momentum on innovation and brand collaboration · Expanding product and brand offerings Finally, the company also recently improved its eye-test and fitting experience for progressive (dual-vision) users.

Lenskart has one of the highest gross margins amongst global eyewear companies 63.4% in India and 68.9% consolidated during 1HF26 - despite having lower ASP than its Western peers, supported by scale, centralisation, and vertical integration. Over F231HF26, the company improved its India gross margins by 330bps. This, along with operating leverage and efficiency measures, has translated into higher EBITDA margins. Post-rent EBITDA margins for the India business rose from 1.6% in F23 to 9.8% in F25 and 13.4% in 1HF26.

Lenskart's store-level EBITDA margin (post-rent) stands at ~33%, even after including new stores and offering remote optometry. However, marketing, technology, and corporate overheads, which are largely fixed costs at ~20% of revenues, have kept its India business' post-rent EBITDA margin low. Key expenses include non-store employee costs (~8% of revenues, we estimate), marketing (7-7.5%, we estimate), manufacturing related costs (7%, we estimate), and other overhead costs. With most high fixed-cost investments now complete, we believe the company is positioned to benefit from operating leverage as revenue grows. Management believes the long-term stable margin potential (post-rent) for the eyewear category could approach ~25%. We note that EssilorLuxottica currently has a post-rent EBITDA margin of ~18%.

1) Scope for further gross margin improvement: While scale remains Lenskart's top priority, management is committed to improving margins as the company grows. Drivers of margin improvement include i) increased in-house manufacturing, particularly for frames (20-25% cheaper to produce in India vs sourcing from China with savings on import duties and lower labor costs), ii) procurement efficiencies from scale, iii) continued manufacturing improvements, and iv) enhanced product mix with a rising share of higher-margin lenses (e.g., progressive lenses. M 2) Visible operating leverage benefits: Most of Lenskart's technology investments are complete, including GeoIQ (machine learning platform), TangoEye (computer vision platform), and an internal technology team of 491 members, with payroll costs at 1.7% of consolidated revenues. We expect central employee expenses, technology expenses, and other expenses to grow at a slower pace than revenues, supporting margin improvement.

India's eyewear market remains highly fragmented, with over 70% of prescription eyeglass sales flowing through unorganized channels as of F25. Lenskart competes with Titan Eyecare, GKB Opticals, Specsmakers, and other regional chains, while also facing indirect competition from global lens manufacturers such as EssilorLuxottica, Hoya, and Carl Zeiss.

· Lenskart's F25 India revenues are over 3x that of Titan's Eyecare division, and are much larger in size compared to other national and regional players such as GKB Opticals, Specsmakers (based out of Southern India). In terms of revenue growth, Lenskart delivered a 29% revenue CAGR over F23-25, vs Titan Eyecare's 8% CAGR. · In terms of total store count in India, Lenskart operated 2,270 stores as of 1HF26, greater than Titan Eyecare's 897 stores and more than 10x that of GKB Opticals stores. Lenskart added ~650 stores between F23-25, compared to one net store addition by Titan Eyecare during the same period.

· Lenskart's average revenue per sq.ft. of ~Rs25K for its India business is higher than Titan Eyecare's ~Rs20K in F24, reflecting Lenskart's premium positioning. According to Redseer, Lenskart's average revenue per sq.ft. in F25 was the highest among leading, large, organized prescription eyeglass retailers in India. · Lenskart derives ~25% of volumes online. Titan Eyecare offers its products through integrated online and offline channels. GKB and Specsmakers remain largely offline, with very minor online contribution.

1) Centralized manufacturing and supply chain capabilities: Lenskart follows a centralised supply chain model that fulfills orders across channels, with two facilities in India - Bhiwadi, Rajasthan and Gurgaon, Haryana - that manufacture frames, lenses, and prescription eyeglass and two regional facilities - in Singapore and the UAE - that make prescription eyeglasses. In 2017, Lenskart established Baofeng Framekart Technology Limited, a JV (Lenskart has a 51% stake) that spans 30 years. The JV exclusively manufacture frames and related eyewear products for Lenskart brands on a cost-plus-10% basis. Lenskart's Bhiwadi facility, which is 75% automated, is among the two largest vertically integrated and centralised manufacturing facilities for prescription eyeglasses globally, according to Redseer.

In F25, Lenskart manufactured 13.16mn units of prescription eyeglasses in-house, or 69.87% of its total prescription eyeglasses sold globally. The company also manufactured 6.44mn frames and 4.06mn lenses in-house. Additionally, 75.37% of Lenskart's inventory is centralised and stored at its manufacturing facilities, with in-store inventory primarily serving as display stock. Lenskart previously sourced its frames and lenses from select manufacturers. In recent years, the company has shifted towards manufacturing frames and lenses (for complex and value-added lenses) in-house, while continuing to sell directly to customers. Manufacturing frames in-house enables it to design its own styles to align with the latest trends. An in-house supply chain reduces reliance on external suppliers and enhances quality and cost control.

Prescription eyewear requires a complex supply chain given the need for precision and customization for every customer order. Each order involves a multi-step process to produce a made-to-order product. Lenskart's manufacturing process for prescription eyeglass is entirely centralised, thus moving the complexity of manufacturing upstream compared to the traditional model of in-store order fulfillment. This centralised approach allows Lenskart to 1) leverage economies of scale across markets, 2) maintain quality at lower costs, 3) scale operations efficiently, 4) offer a broad assortment of eyewear, and 5) achieve faster fulfillment/delivery timelines. In F25, Lenskart's average material costs to manufacture prescription eyeglasses were 35-40% lower than the costs incurred by traditional retail stores in India at comparable quality, aided by supplier negotiations, capital investments in robotics, quality systems, process engineering, and backward integration. Lenskart's India supply chain can also be leveraged in international markets to procure lenses, frames, and other raw materials for facilities outside India and to supply products manufactured in

India. Logistics and delivery: Lenskart leverages technology across its logistics operations. While Lenskart does not own or operate logistics infrastructure, these services are integrated into its network and are managed by an in-house team to ensure customer convenience. As of F25, the company offered next-day delivery in 40 cities and three-day delivery in 69 cities across India. According to Redseer, Lenskart operated one of the fastest intercity logistics networks in India and, as of F25, was the only eyewear company in the country to provide next-day delivery at scale across 40 cities for orders placed up to 9pm.

Its technology-led R&D initiatives help it to enhance customer experience, drive operational efficiencies, and support long-term profitability. As of June 2025, Lenskart's technology team of 491 members was responsible for building, maintaining, and enhancing core technology infrastructure, which also supports its international business. Technology has enabled the company to open 300+stores annually while maintaining low store payback periods, deliver strong SSSG, and increase eye-tests by 50% YoY, while continuing to scale operations both in India and internationally.

In addition to its in-house technology capabilities, Lenskart has made strategic acquisitions, including 1) Quant Duo Technologies in F23 to develop a custom platform that enables real-time micro market intelligence and identifies high-potential new store locations, and 2) Tango IT solutions in F24 to leverage visual AI technology so that it can enhance product quality and in-store customer experience. · Customer engagement: Lenskart's customers can centrally access their purchase history, previous eye test results, prescription details, order tracking information, and manage returns/exchanges through any channel. The company leverages AI to enhance customer experience with tools such as its in-house-developed facial management and frame recognition system, which powered 38.59mn virtual trials in F25. These capabilities enable smarter recommendation algorithms and deliver a superior customer experience. · Retail store expansion: Lenskart leverages its geoanalytics platform, GeoIQ, to expand its store network. The platform analyzes 3,000+ variables, including mobility patterns, satellite imagery, and traffic flow to identify high-potential M

catchments. The platform can map 5,000 potential store locations and predict revenue with high accuracy, ensuring consistent store payback periods and disciplined store expansion. · Retail store operations: Lenskart's AI-enabled computer vision tool, TangoEye, analyses CCTV footage from its stores to measure foot traffic, monitor in-store activity, and automatically analyze visual data. This approach optimizes customer flow, merchandise placement, and store operations, driving higher footfall-to-sale conversion and supporting overall volume-based SSSG. · Product and merchandising: To redefine the eyewear selection experience, Lenskart offers an AI-powered eyewear stylist that supports multiple languages on its app. This tool analyzes facial structure and style and assists customers in choosing their eyeglasses through a video chat.

· Manufacturing and Supply chain: Lenskart's Bhiwadi facility features robotic surfacing systems to ensure precise alignment with each order specification, as well as an automated dispatch and delivery system. The company uses automated sorting facilities that use robots to sort orders by destination, integrating customized sorting algorithms with fleet management systems to support its omni-channel platform. These capabilities enable seamless integration with lastmile logistics and delivery partners.

· AI-driven eye testing (remote optometry): This technology, which is available in 165 stores across India and 274 stores in Japan as of March 2025, drove a 50% increase in eye tests for Lenskart in 2QF26. Because of the limited number of optometrists available in both India and the rest of Asia, the company launches new stores that offer remote eye-test capability from day one. Currently, more than 500 stores run on AI-enabled remote testing, alongside self eye-test kiosks and mobile eye-test options. This approach has enabled Lenskart's optometrists to conduct about 30 eye tests daily across locations, compared to 12 previously at a single location.

3) Omni-channel presence: Lenskart operates an omni-channel retail network. While 76% of units in India were sold via the offline store network, customers contributing ~45% of F25 revenues engaged with the company digitally up to 90 days before completing their transactions in-store.

· Offline network: Lenskart has an offline network of 2,270 stores in India (as of September 2025) with a retail area of 1.65 mn sq.ft. (as of March 2025) spread across 431 cities with 43% of the stores in metros, 22% in Tier 1 cities, and 35% in Tier 2 cities. Lenskart operates one of the largest retail networks in the country, with 2,270 stores, placing it ahead of most branded retail chains and second only to Reliance Trends (~2,100+ stores) in terms of scale. As of F25, 85% of its stores were under the COCO format. The company uses geoanalytics to identify store locations, predict revenue potential, and estimate payback period, enabling faster payback periods on new stores. Its stores in India generated Rs23,493 in revenue per sq ft in F25, the highest among leading organized retailers, according to Redseer.

· Online channel: This includes the company's website and mobile applications (100mn cumulative downloads as of March 2025) as well as third-party platforms, including e-commerce and quick-commerce. Unlike in other consumer categories, eyewear customers often seek guided optometry tests, product trials, and expert-assisted selections before making a purchase. This need for trust, accuracy, and verification makes the offline channel indispensable in the consumer journey. Physical presence enhances visibility, drives walk-in traffic, and reinforces Lenskart's reputation for reliability and service quality. Its stores act as experience hubs, strengthening customer engagement and delivering higher conversion rates compared to purely digital channels. The company also offers its services through telephone-assisted calls and offers 'at-home try-on' services. We believe Lenskart's offline footprint is a critical differentiator, strengthening brand credibility, enhancing customer engagement, and driving higher conversions.

We think Lenskart's international expansion mirrors EssilorLuxottica's strategy of vertical integration, strategic acquisitions (notably Owndays), and a technology-driven approach, targeting a US$19.1bn eyewear market across Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, and the Middle East. Lenskart leverages its centralized Indian supply chain and manufacturing capabilities while establishing small regional facilities for faster local delivery, achieving 400bps gross margin improvement internationally over F23-25. Unlike typical Indian brands that target diaspora communities, Lenskart adopts a localized approach with geographically specific merchandising, store locations, and marketing, while deploying India-developed technology infrastructure (AI-driven analytics, remote optometry across 266 stores, self-eye-test facilities) across all markets. Its expansion strategy follows a measured, tiered approach prioritizing SSSG (26% international revenue growth in 1HF26) over aggressive store additions.

· Progress in improving profitability and capital deployment in the international business. · Macro and competitive environment in each geography · Regulatory environment for trade, foreign entities, insurance, and healthcare in each market · Foreign currency fluctuations. We note that Lenskart does not hedge its currency exposure separately, but its exposure to revenues generated from different markets is offset by importing raw materials

Lenskart expanded internationally by opening its first Lenskart store in Singapore in 2019. It subsequently entered the UAE in 2021 and Saudi Arabia in 2023. In August 2022, the company acquired a majority stake in the Japanese eyewear company Owndays, which had stores across Japan and Southeast Asia. Owndays, accounts for most of the company's international revenues, we estimate. As of September 2025, Lenskart had 679 stores across 13 international markets. Most (41%) of its stores are in Japan, while 39% are in Southeast Asia, of which ~60 stores are in Singapore. Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan are its key international markets. Each market is at a different life-cycle stage - Singapore is an established market where Lenskart is the leader with ~25% market share, Saudi Arabia is in the early phase of strategic investment. Japan and Thailand are in the mid-stage, with expanding store networks and improving unit economics.

Overall, the international business accounted for 43% and 21% of F25 consolidated revenues and EBITDA (post-rent), respectively. F25 gross margin was 74.7%, higher than the India business, but higher employee costs and rental expenses resulted in lower EBITDA margin (post-rent) of 3.6%. M Similar to India, the company has an omni-channel approach internationally with an an offline store network of 679 stores (72% COCO: 28% franchise stores, as of F25). While most international sales (97% of F25 volumes) come from the offline channel, the company also has an online presence and has launched the Lenskart mobile application in countries such as Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand. In Singapore, the company launched both its website and store in 2019. Following the Owndays acquisition in 2023, Lenskart also launched an Owndays mobile application in Singapore.

Lenskart's merchandising strategies are tailored to each geography while maintaining operational consistency and offering quality eyewear at affordable prices. Its eyeglasses frames, sunglasses, prescription lenses, and lens coatings are designed in-house by design teams located in India and Japan. Its design collections are shared across markets and its products are modified to suit local preferences while maintaining some consistency globally. In international markets, Lenskart offers a diverse range of products across price points ranging from US$48 (Rs4,143) to US$670 (Rs57,344). The brand also introduces local collections catering to festive occasions such as Ramadan in the Middle East, Lunar New Year, and Halloween. Following the Owndays acquisition, Lenskart launched the Owndays brand in India as its premium offering using Japanese technology for both frames and lenses. Similarly, the Meller acquisition in 2025 gave Lenskart access to the sunglasses brand to cater to the younger Gen Z population.

Similar to the India business, Lenskart offers complimentary eyetests in all its stores overseas; during F25 it conducted 2.56mn eye tests internationally. The company offers a "Lenskart Gold" membership program in select international markets. The Owndays brand also has a membership-based loyalty program that allows customers to earn points for every eyewear product purchased. Points can be redeemed for discounts, vouchers, free products, or other exclusive offers. M

Owndays is a Japanese eyewear brand incorporated in 1989. When it was founded the brand initially focused on offering a wide selection of frames with a "Simple Pricing" model, i.e., no extra charges for basic single vision lenses. Subsequently, the brand expanded its offerings to fashion- and lifestyle-oriented eyewear products. Owndays follows a simple pricing strategy wherein every pair of eyeglasses has a price indicated on the frame with no additional charge for standard lenses of any power. The brand also offers a unique 20-minute feature, wherein the prescription glasses are processed in store within 20 minutes of getting an eye test. In 2013, the brand started expanding across different markets in Southeast Asia, first launching in Singapore, followed by Taiwan in 2014, subsequently entering 1-3 new markets every year until 2019.

In November 2018, L Catterton Asia and Mitsui & Co. invested in Owndays. In August 2022, Lenskart acquired a 92.27% stake in Owndays for Rs25,128mn, and in F25 it increased its stake by acquiring an additional 4.4% for Rs1,313mn. Currently, Lenskart owns a 96.7% stake in Owndays; the remaining ~3% stake is still held by the earlier founders Mr. Shuji Tanaka and Mr. Takeshi Umiyama. Mr Takeshi Umiyama, the CEO of Owndays, continues to operate the business and is currently Head of Southeast Asia and Japan for Lenskart.

Lenskart's international expansion is still in the early stages. The company follows a calibrated international expansion strategy with a tiered approach, prioritizing refinement of operating models in each geography to align with local requirements before accelerating store additions. In 1HF26, international revenue grew 26% YoY, driven primarily by SSSG. We estimate 55-65 new store additions annually over F27-29, implying 7-8% CAGR in its store network and higher SSSG. Overall, we expect international revenues to grow by 15% annually over F27-30.

The margin profile for the international business is still weaker than the India business. In 1HF26, international gross margin higher was 75.7%, higher than India gross margin of 63.4%, aided by higher bill values, but slightly lower than JINS (Lenskart's competitor in Japan) gross margin of 78%. We see potential for Lenskart to improve its international gross margin and build in 160bps of margin improvement over the next five years as its increases its sourcing from India and on operating leverage. Since the acquisition of Owndays and integration with Lenskart's India supply chain, the international segment's product margin has improved 420bps in the past two years. While its Singapore and Dubai operations are integrated with India, the integration of other markets is underway and M increasing gradually, which we think should lead to higher international segment margins going forward.

Lenskart's vertically integrated model is a key driver of its success. Over the years, the company has expanded capacity with the launch of its Bhiwadi facility in 2023 and increased installed capacity within existing facilities at a 34% CAGR over F23-25. The company is also in the process of setting up a new facility in Hyderabad (Telangana), which will be significantly larger than the 10.69 acre Bhiwadi facility with a 50mn pair annual capacity (~2x the capacity of Bhiwadi). It entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Telangana in December 2024, and the facility is expected to be ready in the next 18-24 months. This new facility is seven minutes away from the Hyderabad airport, and should boost supply to international markets in addition to India. A large portion of the facility will focus on deeper backward integration of frame and lens manufacturing, which should help improve margins, optimize the working capital cycle, lower lead time, and accelerate product innovation.

In line with growth trends, capacity utilization has increased from 48% in F25 to 63% in 2QF26. To maintain capital efficiency, capex for civil infrastructure (~20% of the total) will be done initially, and the high-cost machinery component of the capex will be purchased and installed in phases as demand picks up. We forecast overall capex of Rs21bn over the next three years (i.e., F26-28), of which Rs10bn will be for manufacturing.

Globally, smart glasses have gained popularity and represent a significant growth opportunity for eyewear companies. EssilorLuxottica and Meta began collaborating in 2019, and launched Ray-Ban Stories in 2021, followed by the second generation of RayBan Meta smart-glasses in October 2023. The success of Ray-Ban Meta and rising consumer adoption have intensified the competitive landscape in the smart-glasses segment, with players including Google, Amazon, Snap, Huawei and Samsung, and potentially Apple. Recently Google, Kering Eyewear, and Warby Parker announced a partnership combining expertise and assets across AI (Google), brand, design, manufacturing (Kering), and distribution (Warby Parker).

Our Morgan Stanley European Brands team covering EssilorLuxottica believes wearables growth has been incremental rather than cannibalistic. EssilorLuxottica's underlying growth has accelerated alongside wearables, benefitting from a broader halo effect and a tailwind from attachment purchases of prescription lenses. Smart glasses are also gross margin dilutive. See EssilorLuxottica: FrAIming the Wearable Opportunity and EssilorLuxottica: What's going on with Ray-Ban | Meta?.

In India, the smart-glasses market is still evolving. A few options are currently available, including Ray-Ban Meta glasses and lower-priced variants. In December 2024, Lenskart launched Phonic, an audio eyewear that features built-in Bluetooth speakers for music, calls, and voice assistant interaction. Phonic is priced at Rs4k, vs Rs30k+ for Ray-Ban Meta. In July 2025, Lenskart formed a partnership to develop a new generation of smart glasses. The company plans to launch its own AI-powered camera smart glasses "B by Lenskart M

· Globally, eyewear category dynamics vary across regions, but the market remains a largely offline-dominated and highly fragmented. In certain developed markets where eye tests are covered by insurance, partnerships with insurance providers are important. Providing eye tests is also a common practise across optical retailers worldwide. · Each company has its own customer value proposition. EssilorLuxottica owns some of the largest lenses and frames brands globally and also owns different retail brands. In the US, National Vision is a value-focussed player with its signature offer of two pairs of glasses plus an eye exam for US$95. Warby Parker is a relatively new D2C entrant established in 2010. It offers fashionable frames and lenses starting at US$95. JINS in Japan follows an "All-in-One Price' with no extra charges for lenses. It also offers certain types of lenses in 30 minutes, similar to Owndays.

· Excluding EssilorLuxottica, which has a vertically integrated model, most eyewear companies rely on importing low-cost frames from countries such as China. Most players either maintain optical labs or partner with labs for lens finishing and fitting. · Global players offer remote optometry services. · Smart glasses is an important theme emerging in developed markets. · In terms of margins, gross margins vary between 55% and 78% across players.

EssilorLuxottica has a distinctive position as a global integrated player, working across lenses (including the Varilux, Transitions, and Crizal brands), frames (including the Ray-Ban and Oakley brands) and retail distribution (such as LensCrafters and Sunglass Hut), with operations spanning R&D, manufacturing, logistics and distribution. Overall, it has more than 150 brands and close to 18,000 retail locations. The company operates worldwide, but generates close to half of its sales in North America. EssilorLuxottica was built through a series of acquisitions with the merger of Essilor (world's largest global lens manufacturer) and Luxottica (world's leading consumer eyewear (frames) group) in 2018. In July 2019, EssilorLuxottica also acquired GrandVision, a global leader in optical retailing, which further enhanced EssilorLuxottica's vertical integration and strengthened European direct optical retail distribution

· Business mix: 74% of EssilorLuxottica's 2024 revenues was generated from the vision care segment, followed by 23% from sun business. In eyewear frames, EssilorLuxottica has a significant proprietary branded portfolio, including its two largest eyewear brands Ray-Ban (12% of Group total sales in 2024) and Oakley (5% of Group total sales in 2024). Beyond this, Persol, Oliver Peoples, and Vogue Eyewear are the company's largest frame brands, although these are substantially smaller than Ray-Ban and Oakley. Licensed eyewear frame brands account for close to 10% of the company's 2022 sales (Prada is the most significant licensing partner; Prada, Prada Linea Rossa, and Miu Miu brand names together accounted for ~3% of the Group's sales in 2024). In eyeglass lenses, EssilorLuxottica has a broad portfolio and Varilux, Crizal, and Transitions the three largest brands (and broadly similar in size).

· Channel mix: EssilorLuxottica divides its sales into two reporting channels 1) Direct-to-Consumer (DTC, 53% of 2024 sales), which includes Brick & Mortar store sales (40%), e-commerce sales (7%) and Managed Vision Care (6%), the company's insurance business. EssilorLuxottica's main DTC banners are: Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, Target Optical, and OPSM; and 2) Professional Solutions (47% of 2024 sales), is the wholesale business wherein the company serves over 300,000 third-party eye care professionals ranging from independent opticians to optical retail banners, including the company's franchisee stores, department stores and duty-free shops, as well as third-party e-commerce platforms.

· Profitability profile: Overall, EssilorLuxottica in 2024 had a gross margin profile of 63.4% and adjusted EBIT margin of 16.7%. Across channels, gross margins for the DTC channel are higher than Professional Solutions gross margins, as the company captures the full retail mark-up of the products. However, DTC margins also come with a higher opex base, related to the running of stores (vs the opex-light wholesale model), leading to overall lower margins at the EBIT level on average. Brick & Mortar EBIT margins are broadly in line with overall direct-to-consumer margins. E-commerce is M

EssilorLuxottica's most profitable channel, even higher than the EBIT margin seen in Professional Solutions, as the combination of capturing the retail mark-up (vs wholesale), high ASP and low-return rates (at least relative to online apparel retailers that have instead struggled with profitability) and low operating costs (given scale and lack of store operating costs versus Brick & Mortar) translates to a very profitable online business.

- · Manufacturing and supply chain: EssilorLuxottica manufactures lenses and frames. The company does not manufacture contact lenses. The manufacturing process is complex, with the company stating it typically takes 85 manufacturing steps to make a lens and 70 steps to make a frame. As of December 31, 2024, EssilorLuxottica and its partners operated 46 mass production facilities worldwide and 562 prescription labs (61 industrial labs and had 501 proximity labs). For lens manufacturing, the mass production plants produce either finished lenses (that do not require prescription laboratories) or semi-finished-lenses, which are then sent to prescription laboratories for finishing to align with the exact patient specifications. For frames, the design, development, and manufacturing takes place in EssilorLuxottica's eyewear production sites worldwide, and some frames are procured from third-party vendors. In terms of eyewear production units, as of December 2024

- 51% units in Asia, 32% in Italy, 10% in North America and 7% in Latin America. By eyewear production value, 55% was in Italy, 32% in Asia, 10% in North America and 3% in Latin America. The company's production plants are scaled, high volume and in low-cost areas, with EssilorLuxottica manufacturing c.560mn prescription lenses (~280mn pairs) and 160mn pairs of non-prescription sun lenses in 2024.

EssilorLuxottica in India: The company has had a presence in India since 1988. Its lenses (Crizal lenses and the recently launched Varilux lenses) dominate the Indian market. The company is expanding its retail presence in India through its partnership with Reliance retail for brands such as Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, and Vision Express. EssilorLuxottica's brands both for frames and lenses are also available in India through its distribution channel. It also has a manufacturing presence in India - it has a frame manufacturing facility in Rajasthan, Bhiwadi and ~85 labs for coating lenses. Media articles indicate that the company is looking to further expand its manufacturing capabilities in India. EssilorLuxottica currently has a high market share high in the country, owing mainly to its lens supply chain. M

We expect Lenskart's India business revenue to grow 24% YoY in F26 (1HF26 growth of 25%, 2HF26 estimate of 24%) and 23% annually in F27-30. Growth will be primarily volume-driven, with a minimal increase in revenue per eyewear unit (0-1% in the next five years). Expansion will be led by the offline store network (we project 450 new stores annually over the next three years, implying an 18% store network CAGR over F25-28) and strong SSSG (15-16% in F25 and 1HF26).

Overall, we expect Lenskart to continue outpacing the overall eyewear category growth of 13% (RedSeer estimates) and the organized eyewear market growth of 19% (Redseer estimates), gaining market share. We expect India EBITDA margins (reported) to improve from 16% in F25 to 23.2% by F30, driven by a 150bps improvement in gross margins, 260bps lower employee expenses and 320bps lower other expenses. We look for preIndAS 116 (post-rent) EBITDA margin to rise to 17.2% by F30, up from 9.8% in F25.

Base case expectations include 1) Lenskart will continue to grow ahead of the eyewear market and organized players, gaining market share. We expect India business revenue to rise at a 23% CAGR over F27-30, with a higher 24% growth in F26 (similar to 1HF26 trends), 2) Lenskart opens 450-500 new stores annually in the next five years, 3) internationally, we expect the growth momentum to sustain at 15-16% from 2HF26 to F30 (18% in F25), 4) margins to improve in both India and international markets, aided by operating leverage, better gross margins with increasing share of inhouse manufacturing, and cost efficiency measures. We look for India EBITDA margins to improve to 23.2% by F30 from 15.9% in F25, and international EBITDA margins to improve to 22.5% from 17.3% in F25. Overall, we project 20%, 28%, and 32% revenue, EBITDA and net profit CAGR over F25-30, respectively. M

Bull case assumptions include 1) faster revenue growth in India at a 26% CAGR over F2530, owing to a faster pace of store openings and success of new innovations including smart glasses, 2) international geographies benefit from the India strategies and expand at an 18% CAGR over F25-30, 3) the faster top-line growth, along with operational efficiencies and higher in-house manufacturing, result in F30 EBITDA margins expanding to 24.2% by F30 in India (vs 23.2% in our base case) and 23.5% internationally (vs 22.5% in our base case). Bear case assumptions include 1) India business revenue to rise at a slower 18% CAGR over F25-30, slightly lower than the organized eyewear category, 2) network expansion slows down, 3) international growth is lower at an 11% CAGR over F26-30, due to weaker demand conditions and slower network expansion. Consequently, margin expansion is also lower.

Valuation methodology: We value Lenskart's India and international businesses separately to factor in the differences in profitability (post-rent) and growth levels, track record of profitability, and terminal growth rate potential. Relative valuation multiples for peers in India and international markets are also different. We value Lenskart's India business on a 12-month forward EV/EBITDA basis, as EV/EBITDA is a common metric used to value and compare retailers. For the International business we use EV/sales as our valuation metric as Lenskart's post-rent EBITDA margins are still low currently, and also to adjust for any differences in global accounting terminologies.

In our base case scenario, we expect 1) the India business to trade at 41x 12-month forward EV/EBITDA, in line with the average EV/EBITDA multiple for similar best-in-class discretionary & retail peers including Titan, Dmart, Trent, Page, Vishal, FSN E-commerce, and Brainbees, and 2) the international business to trade at 3.2x 12-month forward EV/ sales, in line with the average for global eyewear peers such as EssilorLuxottica, Warby Parker, and JINS Holding. All multiples are based on FactSet consensus estimates. In our bull case scenario, we assume Lenskart's strong business performance and optimism leads the stock to trade at 1) 64x 12-month forward EV/EBITDA for the India business, in line with average for high-growth new age companies such as Eternal, FSN E-commerce, Brainbees, and MakeMyTrip, and 2) International trades at 4.8x 12-month forward EV/ sales, similar to EssilorLuxottica.

In our bear case scenario, we assume Lenskart's relatively weak business performance leads to pessimism in the stock and that it trades at 1) a 40% discount to the 12-month forward EV/EBITDA multiple of best-in-class discretionary and retail peers in India, and 2) International business trades at 2.4x 12-month forward EV/sales in line with the average of Warby Parker and JINS Holding. Price target of Rs445, implying 10% upside potential: We assign probability weightings of 50% to our base case, 25% to our bull case and 25% to our bear case. Our bull case weighting reflects the long-term market share opportunity in a category that is de-linked from macro pressures, but seeing traction due to lifestyle changes and the company's strong business moats, while our bear case weighting reflects risk from failure to execute network expansion profitably.

Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold and sell. Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone. In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice. An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations.

The Stock Ratings described below apply to Morgan Stanley's Fundamental Equity Research and do not apply to Debt Research produced by the Firm. For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with FINRA requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold, and sell but represent recommended relative weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a buy recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
