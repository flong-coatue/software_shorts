EL shares up today on the back of an article from The Verge flagging that Meta is pausing plans to launch Meta Ray-Ban Display smartglasses ex-US by early '26, due to 'unprecedented demand and limited inventory.' This backs EL's major capacity expansion and bolsters expectations for DD sales growth in FY26e and positive momentum into 4Q25. This comes after the shares have fallen >10% in the past month likely on profit taking and misplaced competition concerns.

"Unprecedented demand and limited inventory". The article from the Verge flags that Meta is pausing plans to launch Meta Ray-Ban smartglasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the UK by early 2026, due to 'unprecedented demand and limited inventory." Meta also said in its blog post that 'since launching last fall, we've seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026'. Hence, Meta/EL will focus on fulfilling orders in the US while re-evaluating their approach to international availability.

Our takeaways. Great news that the groundbreaking Meta RayBan Display is on short supply in the US due to unexpectedly strong demand and ex-US roll out will be delayed vs initial expectations of early '26. This further backs EL previous comments about capacity build-up for all smartglasses (incl RayBan Meta 1st/2nd-Gen, Meta Ray-Ban Display and Oakley Meta Vanguard) having moved throughout 2025 from 10m pair capacity by end-26 to hinting at outsourcing production beyond the 10m on the Q3 call. Importantly, we view this as also great news ahead of the Q4 print where high expectations have been built following a stellar Q3 (+11.7%cc growth). More broadly, we believe this backs buy-side hopes for DD growth at cc in '26 (sell-side currently at +9.4% having moved up from 8.0-8.5% post-Q3) and this should bring renewed momentum to the shares after a strong run in 2025, but a 10% decline in the past month likely due to profit taking and misplaced competition concerns.

No major deviation from recent positive sales trends. Given strong momentum (+8.8%cc at 9M25) and heartening comments from our latest catch up with EL ("no major deviation" in biz trends vs prev. comments of LensCrafters/SunglassHut accelerating from HSD in Q3), we feel comfortable with our FY25 estimates (+9.1%cc in line with cons.). We are more cautious on mgin with 16.4% (down 30bp y/y / cons 16.6%), given tariffs/Meta (>100bp HW in H1) and FX (20bp HW) should have all worsened in 2H25.

Eyes On Tech Prize. EL is a structural share taker/prime consolidator in a steadily growing optical market but also a strong innovator from MedTech (Stellest) to Digital (Ray-Ban Meta) and Hearing Care (Nuance). Given Meta's ambitions in wearables, we continue to believe a broadened partnership/stakeholding is possible. After a nice run in 2025, EL shares have retreated ~10% in the past month leaving shares trading at ~36x P/E 26e, an attractive valuation in our view. * Jefferies GmbH

EssilorLuxottica is the leading global producer and distributor of eyewear frames and lenses. It was formed in 2018 from the combination of Luxottica, a market leader in premium, luxury, and sports eyewear, and Essilor, the No. 1 manufacturer and distributor of ophthalmic lenses and equipment. The combined group has over 9,000 retail stores and holds manufacturing licenses for various luxury brands, including Bulgari, Burberry, Chanel, Giorgio Armani, Prada, Tiffany, and Versace. The group has patents on a variety of lens technology, including Varilux, Eyezen, and Crizal, developed in a network of 500 labs worldwide, in addition to owning a variety of leading eyewear brands such as Ray-Ban, Oakley, and Persol. Valuation: We value EL through an equally weighted avg of a DCF valuation (6.25% WACC; 2.0% TGR) and two comps-based valuation (50-55% premium to Eye Care peers / 20% premium to Luxury peers).

Risks: Risks from COVID-19 abound on both the upside (quicker-than-expected recovery) and downside (ongoing disruption). On the upside, the risk is that stronger organic growth delivery of the two component parts of EL and a faster delivery of net synergies drive upgrades relative to our modelling assumptions. Conversely, on the downside, the risk is that a split board and leadership causes a delay in synergy delivery and mounting pressures in North America sales result in downgrades and a subsequent compression in multiples.

Our price target of $910 is DCF-derived and implies 27x 2027E EPS. Risks include declines in user engagement, advertiser churn, and regulatory risk.

Jefferies Franchise Picks include stock selections from among the best stock ideas from our equity analysts over a 12 month period. Stock selection is based on fundamental analysis and may take into account other factors such as analyst conviction, differentiated analysis, a favorable risk/reward ratio and investment themes that Jefferies analysts are recommending. Jefferies Franchise Picks will include only Buy rated stocks and the number can vary depending on analyst recommendations for inclusion. Stocks will be added as new opportunities arise and removed when the reason for inclusion changes, the stock has met its desired return, if it is no longer rated Buy and/or if it triggers a stop loss. Stocks having 120 day volatility in the bottom quartile of S&P stocks will continue to have a 15% stop loss, and the remainder will have a 20% stop. Franchise Picks are not intended to represent a recommended portfolio of stocks and is not sector based, but we may note where we believe a Pick falls within an investment style such as growth or value.
