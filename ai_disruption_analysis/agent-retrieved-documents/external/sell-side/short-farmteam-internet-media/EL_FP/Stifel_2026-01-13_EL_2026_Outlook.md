· The Optical & Eyewear (O&E) industry is undergoing an unprecedented innovation cycle, cutting across products, services, and distribution models. We identify AI-powered smart glasses, myopia management solutions, teleophthalmology and the convergence of vision care and eyewear Medtech ('oculomics') as the most consequential innovation vectors for 2026. · In this 2026 outlook on European O&E, we revisit our coverage universe through the lens of: (1) upcoming FY25 results, (2) key growth and margin catalysts, and (3) valuation. Overall, this exercise strengthens our conviction in both the sector and our four covered names, which we believe are fundamentally stronger and better positioned today than a year ago. · Following a DCF roll-over and adjustments to our FY25-27 estimates across our O&E coverage, EssilorLux is the only name for which we increase our price target, to €330.00 (from €310.00).

With an average performance of 48% in 2025, our broad O&E universe has materially outperformed major equity indices (Stoxx Europe 600: +17%; Russell 2000: +11%). In a year marked by macro volatility and tariff uncertainty, investor preference has clearly shifted toward stocks offering defensive earnings profiles, resilient demand, and structural margin expansion, criteria that much of the O&E sector has successfully met.

We expect the global O&E market to grow by 4-5% in 2026. While we expect macro uncertainty will remain high, we see opportunity at every turn driven by supportive demographic trends, shifting consumer behaviours and converging technological breakthroughs. For instance, new AI capabilities are unleashing huge capabilities for smart glasses, teleophthalmology platforms and eyewear Medtech, with the potential to unlock new revenue pools, increase lifetime customer value, and accelerate the industry's shift toward recurring, data-driven care.

Far from resting on its laurels, EssilorLux continues to accelerate innovation, particularly in smart glasses, myopia management, and eyewear Medtech. Fielmann and Mister Spex are strategically expanding into Medtech, aiming to become consumers' primary entry point into clinical eye health. In the pressured mid-range segment, Safilo stands out with a disciplined execution strategy centered on compelling brand narratives, sharper differentiation, and deeper ties with independent ECPs.

Our 2026 estimate revisions mainly reflect FX headwinds and incremental opex investments to support accelerated top-line growth, while maintaining resilient profitability. Following the DCF rollover and estimate updates, we reiterate our price targets for Fielmann (€64.00), Mister Spex (€6.00) and Safilo (€2.00), and raise our EssilorLux price target to €330.00 (from €310.00). Within our O&E coverage, our current preference is EssilorLux and Fielmann , which offer the highest growth potential, i.e. adj. EPS CAGR 2024-27e of ~9% and ~13%, respectively, combined with strong upside to our price targets. Cédric Rossi | +33 624 266 269 | cedric.rossi@stifel.com

Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making their investment decision.

In 2025, O&E companies emerged as standout performers in the consumer sector, with an (unweighted) average performance of 48% in 2025, outpacing other consumer categories such as fashion (+21% on average), soft luxury (+9%) and sporting goods (-23%). Amid the macro and tariff uncertainty throughout 2025, investors have favoured stocks that not only demonstrated a relative "tariff-proof" business model, but responded swiftly in implementing tariff-related price increases and shifting sourcing, which enabled them to significantly mitigate the tariff headwind.

Value names thrived in 2025. The eye-catching rallies of National Vision (+148%) and KITS Eyecare (1) (+117%) benefited from robust sales and profit momentum throughout the year, as both companies capitalised on the bipolarisation of the O&E market, with many mid-range customers trading down to save money. However, this bifurcated market was not a source of concern for Safilo's investors, as its share price more than doubled last year (+107%). Performance was driven by the company's successful growth strategy in the contemporary/mid-range segment, which combines compelling storytelling, enhanced brand differentiation, and closer ties with independent eye care professionals (ECPs). These initiatives have supported the group's ongoing margin expansion plan. EssilorLux and Fielmann posted share price gains of 15% and 5%, respectively, over a clearly two-speed year.

· EssilorLux: The share price was still up 30% at end-November (vs. +13% for the Stoxx Europe 600), before experiencing some profit-taking in December amid concerns over Google's potential entry into the AI smart glasses space in 2026. This news triggered a brief rally in the Warby Parker (2) stock in early December (+64% between 4 and 11 December vs. +2% for the Russell 2000). · Fielmann: The share price had climbed 39% by end-June 2025 (vs. Stoxx Europe 600: +7%), supported by a strong 1Q release and a gradual recovery in the German macro environment, driven by expectations of a potential stimulus package. However, as such measures did not materialise, consumer demand in its domestic market (65% of revenue) became more volatile, weighing on performance in 2H 2025.

Obviously, this mixed macro environment in Germany did not help Mister Spex either (84% of sales). The share price, down 21% in 2025, also suffered from investors' aversion to micro caps, despite tangible signs of progress in executing the SpexFocus plan.

EssilorLux will report its FY25 results on 11 February 2026. Following FX developments and industry trends throughout 4Q, specifically within the smart glass category, we are fine-tuning our FY25 estimates: · Sales Performance: We forecast organic growth of +9.2% FX-neutral and +7.5% organic for FY25. This implies +10.4% FX-neutral and +9.9% organic for 4Q 2025. Despite a challenging comparative base, this slight acceleration relative to 3Q (+9.7% organic) is expected to be fueled by a significant contribution from Meta's smart glasses, which remained a primary focus for consumers during the holiday season. Consequently, we anticipate double-digit FX-neutral sales growth for both North America (+11.5%e) and EMEA (+10.0%e) during the final quarter of 2025.

Indeed, we model an all-time high 9.8% FX-neutral sales increase in FY26, followed by HSD FX-neutral growth in FY27e and FY28e, driven by amplifying effects from the group's innovation pipeline, particularly its 'new categories,' such as AI-powered wearables, myopia management, and eyewear Medtech.

Rather than Google's entry into the AI-powered smart glass category this year, we believe managing the production ramp-up will be EssilorLux's main challenge. Indeed, last week Meta announced delays in rolling out its latest Ray-Ban Display smart glasses model outside the U.S., citing stronger-than-expected demand from US customers. Meta Communications Manager, Lisa Brown Jaloza, wrote on the tech group's website that the product waitlist " is now extended well into 2026 ", despite a relatively high retail price (>US$799). We will look for any upward revision to the 10-million-unit annual production capacity target from EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri at the FY25 results presentation in February.

In December, Google said it plans to release two AI-powered smart glass models in 2026: audio-only glasses with its Gemini AI assistant and glasses that will include an in-lens display. Instead of being concerned by a growing competitive environment, we believe that Google's entry is predominantly an opportunity as more big companies investing means faster consumer adoption and a larger overall market, from which EssilorLux and Meta can benefit. Google diving into AI glasses sends a strong signal that this product category has real potential to shift from a niche novelty to a mainstream consumer staple. Recall that EssilorLux brings two main competitive advantages compared with Google and its optical partners:

1. A strong optical expertise, especially since the prescription penetration for smart glasses is quite encouraging (>20% for Ray-Ban Meta wearers and >80% for Nuance Audio users). 2. The industry's widest distribution network with over 300,000 wholesale doors covered and 18,000 stores within DTC globally. As a comparison, Warby Parker operated 313 stores in North America at end-3Q 2025.

We also anticipate meaningful revenue and margin contribution from the US launch of Stellest following its FDA approval in September as the first spectacle lens indicated to treat pediatric myopia. Given the size of the US pediatric vision market and Stellest's first-mover advantage, we view this milestone as a key incremental growth driver for the MM portfolio. Our colleagues in the US conducted a proprietary Myopia Management (MM) survey as part of their Myopia Management Deep Dive: Stellest Poised to Take Center Stage in the US, in November 2025. The survey highlights two key takeaways that are highly supportive of Stellest's US launch trajectory:

1. First, 87% of respondents expect to adopt Stellest within the next twelve months , including 18% that have already adopted the lens, pointing to strong early traction and the potential for rapid penetration among ECPs. 2. Second, among the 80 practices that expect MM solutions to contribute to their 2027 revenues, spectacle lenses ranked as the leading MM modality, accounting for 43% of expected MM revenue, ahead of soft contact lenses at 34% ( see Figure 7 ). This reinforces the attractiveness of spectacle-based solutions such as Stellest and supports our view that spectacles will remain the primary commercial driver of MM adoption in the US market.

While EssilorLuxottica's myopia management (MM) solutions already account for approximately one-third of total sales in Greater China, the group continues to invest aggressively in innovation. The launch of Stellest 2.0 in Greater China, which offers materially improved efficacy in slowing axial elongation, reinforces EssilorLux's technological leadership in MM. The product is expected to roll out across additional key markets in 2026, supporting continued category penetration and mix uplift. In parallel, EssilorLux is expanding its addressable market upstream by targeting myopia prevention. The launch of Essilor Stellest plano lenses in Greater China represents a strategic move toward evidence-based prevention, broadening the MM funnel beyond corrective lenses. Clinical data generated by EssilorLux indicate that delaying myopia onset by just one year can deliver benefits equivalent to more than two years of slowed disease progression, underpinning the long-term clinical and commercial rationale for early-stage intervention.

Traditionally, EssilorLuxottica's entire business was centered on the correction stage via prescription eyeglass lenses (Essilor's forte) and frames or sunglasses (Luxottica's forte), considering that the sunglass category also refers to protection/prevention. The acquisition of Heidelberg Engineering in October 2024 was the first stone laid in that eyewear MedTech ecosystem. Bringing Espansione Group, Cellview, Optegra, RetinAI and Signifeye into the fold did not just add separate capabilities, it creates powerful synergies that reinforce EssilorLux's strategy and competitive position across all three stages of eye care: prevention, correction and cure. Strategically, these acquisitions position EssilorLux as a unique, full-spectrum eye care leader. These acquisitions underscore the group's transformation into what its management calls a 'MedTech' company as it can now offer 'science-backed eye care solutions' in addition to products.

In light of compelling growth prospects andEssilorLux's strong execution, we anticipate that the 'new categories' will be accretive by 2-3pp p.a. to the group's FX-neutral growth in MT and could represent close to 37% of total sales by 2035, vs. around 6% in 2025e. This scenario includes 3-4% average growth for EssilorLux's 'traditional' business, over the 2025-35 period, which is broadly in line with the pace achieved by the global optical and eyewear industry over the past decade.

EssilorLux's share price currently trades at 32.5x on a 12M forward P/E, representing a modest 14% premium compared to its 5Y-average of 28.5x. This premium has significantly reduced following to the company's underperformance in December due to the market's concerns on a fiercer competitive environment in AI-powered smart glasses. In our view, the three margin pressures which led to downwards revisions to consensus' expectations, namely FX headwinds (mainly the weaker USD: ~43% of sales and ~40% of costs), US tariffs and the dilutive impact from smart glasses, are now well reflected in current multiples.

We increase our price target to €330.00 (from €310.00) following the DCF rollover. As a reminder, our PT is exclusively based on a DCF valuation with the following assumptions: · HSD FX-neutral sales growth, 2026-32e. · A gradual improvement in adj. EBIT margin from 16.7% in 2026e to 22% in 2033e, which becomes our normative margin level. · WACC of 7.5% (RFR of 2.5%, risk premium of 6.5% and 0.84x beta) and terminal growth rate of 2.5%, which is consistent with best-in-class peers in luxury, consumer and medtech segments.

Over the past two quarters, either the US (2Q) or Germany (3Q) delivered softer-thanexpected sales performances, raising concerns around Fielmann's ability to fully deliver on its FY25 sales and profit targets. Against this backdrop, a clear re-acceleration in both markets in 4Q would not only be critical to meeting FY guidance, but would also help restore investor confidence: · Sales Performance: We model +4.8% organic in 4Q, implying a modest acceleration vs 3Q (+3.7%). While the macro backdrop remained fragile amid softer consumer confidence indicators in both Germany and the US during the quarter, Fielmann stepped up commercial initiatives. In the US, this includes the continued hiring of new optometrists to support sales capacity and patient throughput. Importantly, management had already flagged robust sales trends in Germany and a further acceleration in the US in September and October, which underpins our expectation of a sequential improvement in 4Q.

· Margin focus delivered (2023-25): Following the strategic pivot toward margin expansion in 2023, Fielmann is on track to deliver a ~430 bps improvement in adj. EBITDA margin over 2022-25e, despite a challenging operating backdrop characterised by inflationary pressures and the integration of two sizable US acquisitions. This performance underscores management's ability to execute on selfhelp and operating leverage initiatives even in a constrained demand environment.

· Growth story set to re-accelerate from 2026. We expect Fielmann to pivot back toward sales growth from 2026 as the group activates the growth levers outlined at its CMD. These include increased marketing support in audiology, the rollout of medical services, the introduction of new store formats in Europe, and the completion of the US business model transformation. As a reminder, management's 2030 guidance implies a 2025-30 sales CAGR of c.10%, including +8-9% organic growth. At this stage, we remain more conservative, assuming +5.2% FX-neutral sales growth in FY26. · Nonlinear margin trajectory beyond 2025 . Management reiterated that the path toward a 25% adj. EBITDA margin by 2030 'will not be linear', reflecting upfront opex investments required to launch Phase 1 of the five-year Vision 2030 plan. Accordingly, we now forecast a modest 30 bps margin dilution to 23.3% in FY26, followed by a rebound in FY27 and a gradual progression toward the 25% MT objective.

· Significant potential upside to MT expectations. Notably, our 2030 sales and adj. EBITDA estimates remain ~21% below Fielmann's targets, leaving substantial scope for upward revisions as execution on Vision 2030 progresses. We view this gap as a key source of MT upside optionality for the equity story. Figure 14 - Stifel sales estimates for 2025-30e vs. 2030 guidance (€m) .

Following the shares' underperformance during 2H25, Fielmann now trades at 7.3x 12month forward EV/EBITDA, corresponding to a 27% discount to its five-year historical average. We view current multiples as increasingly dislocated from the company's MT growth profile. In the near term, we anticipate some downward revisions to CSS expectations ahead of the preliminary FY25 results due by the end of February 2026, as estimates are adjusted to better reflect the group's renewed strategic emphasis on accelerating sales growth in 2026. Beyond this near-term reset, we see current valuation levels as particularly attractive, given Fielmann's growth potential for 2025-30, which we believe is not adequately reflected in its current trading multiples. In addition, a faster-than-expected recovery in the German macro environment, which represents ~67% of group sales, could act as a further catalyst for a progressive re-rating of the stock.

Our price target of €64.00 remains unchanged as the 2% average cut to our FY25-27e adj. EBITDA assumptions is offset by the DCF rollover. Our PT is exclusively based on a DCF valuation with the following assumptions: · FX-neutral sales growth of 5-5.5% for 2026-31e, which remains more cautious than the 8-9% organic growth implied by Fielmann's 2030 sales target. Naturally our estimates do not include M&A contribution that could occur in the period. · A gradual improvement in adj. EBIT margin from 14% in 2024 to 15.8% in 2031e which becomes our normative margin level. · WACC of 8.8% (RFR of 2.5%, risk premium of 7.5% and 0.84x beta) and terminal growth of 2.5%.

FY26 results are due on 26 March. We expect 4Q performance broadly in line with the first nine months, with the SpexFocus initiatives continuing to weigh meaningfully on sales, but with visible progress on margin restoration: · Sales Performance: We expect a sequential improvement in trading, with a 4Q sales decline of ~5%, compared with -18% in 3Q, mainly reflecting easier comparatives, particularly in Germany (4Q 2024: -11% vs. +2% in 3Q 2024). As for Fielmann, Mister Spex did not benefit from a more supportive German consumer sentiment during the quarter; however, it recorded a strong Black Friday 2025, with store sales up 16%, driven by growth in both prescription glasses (+14%) and sunglasses (+20%). For FY25, we forecast a 15% sales decline to €183.5m, in line with the mid-point of management guidance (-10% to -20%).

After two consecutive years of sales decline driven by self-inflicted execution issues related to the SpexFocus initiatives, we expect Mister Spex to return to positive top-line growth in FY26 (SFe: +3%). This recovery is entirely driven by Germany (SFe: +7%), while we continue to expect International revenues to decline by c.15%:

· Online channel stabilisation. After nearly 18 months of 'discount detox', which disproportionately affected the more price-sensitive online customer base, we expect the German online channel to stabilise over the course of the year, supported by improved price perception and a more rational promotional strategy. · Retail expansion in Germany. The four German opticians acquired in 3Q 2025 generate combined annual revenues of approximately €4m and ~€0.5m in EBITDA (including rents). These stores are expected to be consolidated from 1Q 2026, driving a positive scope effect of around 5pp on Germany's sales growth in 2026. Given the highly fragmented nature of the German optical market, ~10.8k optical stores, we do not rule out further bolt-on acquisitions over the course of the year.

· Continued rollout of Switch and Eye Health Checks. The Switch subscription model already represents around 10% of total store sales, and we expect this share to almost double over the course of the year, underpinning revenue visibility and driving higher customer lifetime value. In parallel, the Eye Health Check offering, which saw over 500 tests conducted during Black Friday 2025, is gaining traction, enhancing Mister Spex's medical credibility while being highly margin accretive (gross margin >80%). · Further strengthening of differentiation. While Switch remains a cornerstone of Mister Spex's differentiation vs Fielmann, we expect additional optionality in expanding into myopia management and progressive lenses, where Fielmann's presence is more limited. The latter is particularly attractive, in our view, given Mister . Source: Company Data, Stifel Research

Despite visible signs of good progress in executing SpexFocus, share price performance remains muted as investors are probably waiting for the positive tipping point at the sales level. The name is also negatively impacted by the market aversion for micro caps.

Our price target of €6.00 is based on a DCF valuation with the following assumptions: · Gradual sales recovery in 2026e (+3%) and 2027e (+6%), followed by top-line growth of 5-7.5% in 2028-33e. · A gradual improvement in EBIT margin from -26% in 2024 to a break even point expected in 2028e. This trajectory will likely continue in 2028-33e to reach a normative level of 6.3% at the end of the period. · WACC of 10.6% (RFR of 2.5%, risk premium of 6.5% and 1.25x beta) and terminal growth rate of 2.5%, which is consistent with our optical & eyewear coverage. Spex's ability via Switch to address an older customer cohort, with over 55% of users aged 40+, supporting mix improvement and higher average selling prices.

We anticipate a further expansion in GM in FY26 of ~100bps to 55.8% (SFe), driven by a higher share of prescription sales and the accretive consolidation of optical stores, which typically generate a prescription mix of over 80%. Beyond the mechanical benefits of a return to positive sales growth and operating leverage, we see improving retail efficiency as the key structural margin tailwind. As illustrated in Figure 20, 51 out of 65 stores were EBIT-positive in 3Q25, up from 38 stores in the prior year, highlighting tangible progress in store-level profitability and cost control. While we have revised our FY26e EBIT down from -€8m to -€10m, reflecting one-off costs in the 'lower double-digit euro amount' related to the modernisation of the IT and logistics backbone, we still expect the absolute EBIT loss to narrow materially vs FY25, reinforcing the credibility of the gradual path toward break-even.

Ahead of preliminary FY25 results that will be reported on 29 January, we reiterate our estimates which imply little deviation compared to sales and profit trends achieved in the first 9M: · Sales Performance: We expect +1.7% FX-neutral for 4Q, which represents a modest deceleration vs. 3Q (+2.1% FX-neutral). In November, management pointed out positive trends in both Europe and North America in October (minor month though), ahead of the crucial ski season for Smith in North America. Recent industry data showed a slow season start for ski areas along North America's Pacific Coast, followed by a more favourable second half of December. · Profitability and Margins: Our cautious approach also translates with a modest margin improvement compared to the first 9M: +10 bps both for GM and adj. EBITDA. This 4Q performance leads to a strong 90 bps margin expansion to 10.3%, the highest profitability level since 2013.

In the Optical & Eyewear market, the mid-range segment is increasingly under pressure: many mid-range optical chains and brands are losing volume as consumers either trade up, treating eyewear as a status or fashion purchase, or trade down to save money. Against this backdrop, Safilo has weathered these challenging market conditions by executing a battle-tested playbook that combines: 1. Compelling brand storytelling , particularly around its proprietary brands such as Carrera, Smith, and David Beckham. 2. Enhanced brand differentiation: For example, the Carrera brand leverages its motorsports' heritage to create a bold, sporty identity. 3. Stronger ties with independent ECPs , which are generally positioned in the upper half of the market and do not aggressively push private labels. As a result, they represent a highly complementary channel to optical chains.

We anticipate 3% FX-neutral sales growth, partly offset by an FX headwind of ~1pp. The U.S. market, which accounts for 41% of sales, should also be less volatile than in 2025 now that the tariff landscape has stabilised. In Europe, Safilo should continue to benefit from distribution gains and increased shelf space among key accounts in select markets. At the adj. EBITDA level, we model a further margin improvement of +40 bps to 10.7%, driven by a balanced contribution from GM expansion (+20 bps) and operating leverage (+20 bps), as the group continues to optimise its organisation. In FY27 and FY28, we expect operating leverage to contribute more meaningfully to margin expansion than GM improvement.

Following the stock's rally in 2025, Safilo now trades at 8.1x 12-month forward EV/ EBITDA, representing a 25% premium to its five-year historical average. However, we are not concerned by this valuation level, as our adj. EBITDA margin estimate for 2027 (11.5%) remains well below the company's guidance of 12-13%. Consensus remains even more conservative at 11.2%, implying further upside potential. Our positive stance is underpinned by a successful portfolio transition since 2019, focused on increasing the share of home brands and strengthening Safilo's exposure to the highly profitable and defensive prescription segment relative to sunglasses. Beyond reducing top-line volatility, this shift is expected to support margin expansion and drive higher FCF generation.

Our price target of €330.00 is based on a DCF valuation with the following assumptions: WACC of 7.5% (RFR of 2.5%, risk premium of 6.5% and 0.84x beta) and terminal growth rate of 2.5%, which is consistent with best-in-class peers in luxury, consumer and medtech segments. Key risks to price target/rating: · Limited margin progression due to weakening of the USD, tariff rates and cost inflation. · Significant drop in US consumer sentiment/spending (43% of sales). · Execution issues in "new categories" such as in the smart eyewear category, which could result in disappointing sales and margin trajectories · Dilutive impact of M&A: Historically, bolt-on acquisitions made by EssilorLuxottica have generally had lower margins than the Group. Execution and integration risks could also result in a dilutive impact on EssilorLuxottica's margins.

Our price target of €64.00 is based on a DCF valuation with the following assumptions: WACC of 8.8% (RFR of 2.5%, risk premium of 7.5% and 0.84x beta) and terminal growth rate of 2.5%, which is consistent with our entire optical & eyewear sample. Key risks to price target/rating: · Integration/execution issues with Fielmann USA (c.12% of sales). · Fall in German consumer sentiment and/or spending pullback (67% of 2024 sales). · Dilutive impact of M&A: Historically, bolt-on acquisitions made by Fielmann generally had lower margins than the Group. Execution and integration risks could also result in a dilutive impact on margins. · Midcaps valuation discount given a narrow free float of 27% for a market cap of €3.8bn.

Our price target of €6.00 is based on a DCF valuation with the following assumptions: WACC of 10.6% (RFR of 2.5%, risk premium of 6.5% and 1.25x beta) and terminal growth rate of 2.5%, which is consistent with our entire optical & eyewear sample. Key risks to price target/rating: · Failure to restore decent margins and improve FCF generation. · Fall in German consumer sentiment and/or spending pullback (80% of FY25e sales). · Market aversion for small and midcaps.

Our price target of €2.00 is based on a DCF valuation with the following assumptions: WACC of 9.7% (RFR of 2.5%, risk premium of 6.5% and 1.1x beta) and terminal growth rate of 2.5%, which is consistent with our entire optical & eyewear sample. Key risks to price target/rating: · Failure to execute the portfolio pivot towards home brands that would call into question Safilo's 2027 margin guidance. · Huge drop in US consumer sentiment (~41% of sales). · Loss of key licensing agreements (licensed brand portfolio: 50% of 2024 sales). · Market aversion to small and midcaps.

EssilorLuxottica is the undisputed leader in the optical and eyewear industry, strategically positioned at the intersection of luxury eyewear, MedTech innovation, and AI-driven consumer hardware. Its vertically integrated business model, global retail footprint, and pioneering smart eyewear initiatives offer a compelling long-term growth story, underpinned by strong financials and expanding market opportunities. We continue to expect FX-neutral growth at the upper end of the mid-single-digit range, driven by its existing brand portfolio in frames, lenses, and eyewear, as well as its growing presence in smart eyewear through the Meta partnership and Nuance Audio (OTC hearing aids), and its expanding MedTech initiatives. These catalysts are also expected to contribute to consistent margin improvement,

although we remain more conservative than the company's guidance of 19-20% by the end of FY26. We believe the impact of tariffs will be largely offset by the group's mitigation strategies and its multi-channel approach, particularly in the event of consumer trade-down.

Fielmann is a leading European optical retailer with a strong brand, vertically integrated business model, and a proven track record of profitable growth. The company is executing well on its Vision 2025 strategy and is now transitioning toward Vision 2035, targeting €4 billion in sales and aEBITDA margin of around 25% by 2030. For investors worried about the US market, Fielmann is an appealing European play, given: (1) its European footprint (88% of FY25e sales), (2) one of the highest exposures to the defensive prescription category (~90% of total sales), and (3) self-help catalysts contributing to margin improvement over FY25-26 (i.e. restructuring in Italy, synergies at Fielmann USA, etc.). Management will host a CMD in Frankfurt on 17 September to present more in details its Vision 2035 strategic plan.

Mister Spex is a leading digitally native optical retailer in Germany, with a strong omnichannel presence and a clear strategic roadmap focused on profitability and operational efficiency. Despite short-term revenue pressures, the company's transformation under the SpexFocus program is now better-positioned to deliver tangible margin improvements and positive FCF generation in the MT. Play the multi-year transformation plan. Good progress made on the SpexFocus plan materialised in 1Q numbers and the two key commercial initiatives launched in 2Q, i.e. the Switch subscription plan and Eye Health Checks, should provide greater confidence in the group's execution capabilities, in our view. This turnaround could also be supported by the new German government that might launch a stimulus plan in the coming months.

Safilo continues to muscle up its fundamentals. Safilo is a leading global eyewear manufacturer, undergoing a strategic transformation aimed at margin expansion, digitalisation, and brand portfolio optimisation. Despite macroeconomic and tariff headwinds, the company has demonstrated resilience and operational agility, making it an attractive turnaround play with upside potential. Safilo's concentrated diligent supply chain diversification is reassuring. We also highlight the group's more balanced portfolio between house/licensed brands (c.50-50%) and a growing share of prescription frames (+2pp to 40% at end-FY24) that contribute to the continuous improvement in margins. Recall that Safilo has secured over 90% of its licensed brand portfolio through 2030-31, which is unprecedented in the company's history.
