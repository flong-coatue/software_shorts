This insert is part of a sector report, which is available here . The complex need for ad agencies to adapt and evolve their offering to target advertising at AI agents as well as humans could further increase the diversity around the mean in terms of growth, in what used to be considered a mean-reverting sector. Publicis' consistent sector-leading new business wins, combined with few losses, generating market share gains and best-in-class margins, suggest it will be on the right side of this dispersion. We raise our TP and keep the stock on our Most Preferred list.

▪ Late-2025 and early-2026 have started in a similar fashion to 2025 and previous years, with a couple of significant account wins (Kenvue global media, Vodafone creative and production in EMEA, Flipkart in India), adding to the buffer from earlier wins in 2025 (such as Mars) to be billed incrementally only from 2026. ▪ Raising guidance three times in 2025 was not sufficient to allow Publicis to outperform a weak European Media sector in 2025, so a catch-up is overdue. In terms of our thematic screens, phasing into 2026 is slightly more favourable. The IMF has just raised its global GDP growth forecasts, US consumption seems to be holding up, and 2026 (a so-called mini-quadrennial) will see the return of ad-rich events such as the FIFA World Cup in the US, Publicis' main market, the Winter Olympics in Cortina (Italy), and the US mid-term congressional elections.

▪ Ad agencies have been treated as AI-vulnerable and further de-rated, but the complexity of the challenge in adapting to a potential huge shift from traditional search advertising to agentic AI (OpenAI launched a test of its ad-funded model in the US this week) is unlikely to be managed by advertisers in-house. ▪ Publicis continues to make targeted M&A (EUR800-900m annually) that enhances its competitive advantage, particularly in Connected Media (which represents 60% of group sales) through the likes of influencer platforms, that contributes to reported earnings growth, is easy to integrate and not dilutive to the firm's ROIC. Agency peers, with the exception of niche player Havas, are in disarray, with WPP in endless restructuring, Dentsu unable to find a buyer for its international business and Omnicom and Interpublic in the throes of a complex merger integration based mainly on financial (cost synergies) rather than industrial logic.

- ▪ We raise our FY 2026 organic growth forecast from 4% to 4.7% (VA consensus 4.8%). Together with unchanged margin forecasts (+10bp YOY to 18.2%), this raises our FY EBITA and EPS forecasts by 1%.

- ▪ After rolling over to 2026 forecasts, our multiples-based valuation lifts our TP slightly from EUR97 to EUR98. We retain our Buy rating, and Publicis remains on our Most Preferred list of Media stocks for 2026. Publicis Groupe

Publicis is the third-largest advertising agency group in the world by revenues. Its main agency networks are Publicis Worldwide, Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi (all Creative), Starcom and Zenith (both Media), Publicis Health (Healthcare), Epsilon (CRM) and Sapient (Business Transformation Consulting). Under the Publicis Power of One plan, it has now aggregated its activities into four units, Communications (Creative), Media (Media Buying), Healthcare, and Digital.

n Superior sales mix to agency peers, with 60% of net sales being Connected Media (growing at mid- to high single digits) and less exposed to Technology (Sapient, 15% of sales) than consulting peers. M&A and a large lead versus peers in net new business wins since 2019, and again YTD, adds to growth visibility in the event of a macro downturn. n Clients tend to gravitate even more towards measurable targeted advertising in a downturn. Generative AI could increase personalisation at scale and also drive efficiencies (headcount rising by less than organic growth). n Share price performance since 2021 merely catching up on cumulative EPS growth than multiple expansion, which remains at modest levels.

n Likely to lead agency growth again in 2026 after bumper new business wins in 2025, mostly still to be billed. n Gen AI productivity gains. n OMC/IPG merger means internal focus is an opportunity for peers.

n Leader in high-margin US media-buying market. n Leading agency in business transformation consulting. n Strong balance sheet, stepping up share buybacks. n Ahead of peers in personalsiaton at scale (Epsilon), AI (core AI).

n Headcount rising slower than organic growth could be due to AI. n Marketing to AI agents can boost growth and drive market share gains. n Strong momentum in new business wins (top in six of last seven years). n OMG/IPG merger could take 3 years to integrate, opportunity for peers.

n Our fair value is based on a 85/15 weighting assigned to historical mid-cycle versus low-cycle EV/sales and EV/EBITA, and adjusted P/E multiples based on 2026 forecasts. n We also compare Publicis' multiples with listed agency peers (Dentsu, Havas, Interpublic, Omnicom, WPP), and those of IT Service companies like Cap Gemini, which overlap with Publicis Sapient (15% of sales).

n Growth more narrowly based than before, needs Sapient to return to consistent growth to support Epsilon (where growth could slow once third-party cookie phase-out is complete). n Generative AI could be dilutive to organic growth overall. n CEO had health scare in 2022.

n Subscale in emerging market businesses. n Average advertiisng agency industry growth is currently around zero. n Accessing data from walled gardens of Google, Facebook, Amazon. n Challenges in running a mainly US-based people business from Paris.

n Key-man risk given that CEO had health scare in 2022. n Generative AI could be dilutive to organic growth. n Growth is narrow-based around Media and Epsilon, Sapient negative YTD. n New business wins are 50% of the organic growth, needs to continue.

Buy : The minimum expected upside is 10% over next 12 months (the minimum required upside could be higher in light of the company's risk profile). Hold : The expected upside is below 10% (the expected upside could be higher in light of the company's risk profile). Reduce: There is an expected downside. Accept offer: In the context of a total or partial take-over bid, squeeze-out or similar share purchase proposals, the offer price is considered to be fairly valuing the shares. Reject offer: In the context of a total or partial take-over bid, squeeze-out or similar share purchase proposals, the offered price is considered to be undervaluing the shares. Under review: An event occurred with an expected significant impact on our target price and we cannot issue a recommendation before having processed that new information and/or without a new share price reference. Not rated : The stock is not covered. Restricted : A recommendation, target price and/or financial forecast is not disclosed further to compliance and/or other regulatory considerations.

Due to share prices volatility, ratings and target prices may occasionally and temporarily be inconsistent with the above definition.

Unless otherwise stated in this report, target prices and investment recommendations are determined based on fundamental research methodologies and relies on commonly used valuation methodologies such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), valuation multiples comparison with history and peers, Dividend Discount Model (DDM). Valuation methodologies and models can be highly dependent on macroeconomic factors (such as the price of commodities, exchange rates and interest rates) as well as other external factors including taxation, regulation and geopolitical changes (such as tax policy changes, strikes or war). In addition, investors' confidence and market sentiment can affect the valuation of companies. The valuation is also based on expectations that might change rapidly and without notice, depending on developments specific to individual industries. Whichever valuation method is used there is a significant risk that the target price will not be achieved within the expected timeframe. Unless otherwise stated, models used are proprietary. Additional information about the proprietary models used in this report is accessible on request.

KEPLER CHEUVREUX' equity research policy is to update research rating when it deems appropriate in the light of new findings, markets development and any relevant information that can impact the analyst's view and opinion.
