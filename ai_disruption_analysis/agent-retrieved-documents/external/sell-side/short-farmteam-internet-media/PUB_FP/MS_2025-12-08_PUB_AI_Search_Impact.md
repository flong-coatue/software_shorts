The shift in search trends towards no-click has implications for the advertising landscape and raises questions for Publicis on data collection, ad activation channels and the media landscape complexity evolution. We walk away from our channel checks reassured on prospects. Remain Overweight. Why write this report? We view the implications of the advertising landscape shift for the ad agencies as an emerging debate, which has not captured investors' attention yet, and we think this debate is likely to accelerate in the coming months. Firstly, a significant part of our Overweight investment thesis on Publicis is Epsilon's data, hence it was key to check the resilience of its data collection capabilities in a shifting search landscape. Secondly, display and search make up a large part (~55%) of the advertising ecosystem today and ad agencies sell these in their Media businesses. A change in the advertising ecosystem will likely fuel a debate on the relevance of ad agencies should the environment become less complex.

LLMs-powered search tools and AI summaries are fueling zero-click searching, causing website traffic to drop and likely reducing the relevance of open web display ads. When we look at the evolution of traffic on sites that do not rely on a visit for a specific function (e.g. online shopping, input), such as information providers, news publishers, blogs and forums, the declining trend in traffic is clear. This is tied directly to broader shifts in search. Organic site visits can drop significantly when AI previews appear in search, meaning that open web ad display's relevance is likely to decline. We walked away from our research and industry expert calls reassured on Epsilon's moat and the alternative channel opportunities that should open if web advertising declines. We think the areas below will continue to be a source of debate (more details here):

1. Could it affect Epsilon's ability to collect data? = Low risk 2. Could Publicis' open web display ad activation business decline? Could alternative channels represent a growth opportunity? = Moderate risk & opportunity 3. Do the channel mix shift and new media landscape increase the threat of disruption of Publicis and our broader ad agency coverage? = Low risk We remain Overweight PUB. AI concerns overdone, valuation attractive (10.5x '26e P/E). We think share price upside will be driven by upward consensus revisions (we are above consensus on organic growth) and re-rating (from 10.5x to 14x '26 P/E implied by our PT). We see PUB as well placed to continue outperforming its peers due to: 1) strong product proposition due to deep cross-business integration Morgan Stanley & Co.

M (facilitating the flow of data) and data ownership (via Epsilon offering deterministic data models boasting near 100% accuracy to create audiences and activate ad campaigns), positioning PUB as an independent viable alternative to data-rich 'walled gardens' in the AI era, and 2) relatively low leverage and strong FCF generation, which provides M&A firepower to continue improving the product portfolio. We see the catalyst for re-rating as continued outperformance and MSD % growth with margin expansion.

How does this analysis expand to the rest of our ad agencies coverage? Similar to Publicis, WPP, Havas and S4 Capital are media channel agnostic so could likely make up for lower display ad sales with alternative channels such as video and LLM AI platforms. However, we continue to think that PUB's data ownership provides a competitive advantage, which would apply also with other channels including CTV. Our order of preference is as follows: PUB (Overweight), Havas (Equal-weight), WPP (Equal-weight), S4 Capital (Equal-weight). Foundation M

Summary risks and opportunities

Risk level: Low · Our industry expert calls suggested that only a minority of the data collected by Epsilon comes from the open web. · Most of Epsilon's data comes from partnerships with brands, retailers, banks and others who upload their data to Epsilon's platform. · We don't expect Epsilon's partners' data to reduce on the retailer side even in a scenario where online shopping moves to zero-click as the retailer would still receive data from their customers and their purchase details.

Risk level: Moderate / Opportunity level: Moderate · A large part of Epsilon's data-powered ad activation business is on the open web (banners); Publicis as a Group also has exposure to the sale of open web banners. There could be a reduction in demand reflecting lower open web traffic. · Publicis and Epsilon are independent players whose selling point is to optimise return on ad spend for their clients, as they do not favour any media providers. Therefore, they have full flexibility to shift to channels that make more sense for their clients to advertise on, and a decline in open web display activations would likely be replaced by other channels. · We flag it as a moderate risk due to the potentially lower margin on the sale of videos for Epsilon (according to an industry expert we spoke to), however we note that the impact would likely be very limited at group level as a large part of the Media business' profitability comes from strategic planning and budget optimisation advisory.

· CTV and videos are a fast growth area (mid-teens mid-term CAGR) where Publicis/Epsilon has an existing business and adds value with their data platform to activate to the right audience. Finally, LLM platforms have talked about introducing advertising to their platform so it could become an alternative channel to search.

Risk level: Low - · We don't believe the shift away from open web display ads and search would significantly reduce the complexity of the media landscape. The streaming and connected TV landscape has numerous players globally while there is also not just one LLM-powered AI search platform. Source: Morgan Stanley Research M

Generative AI search monthly traffic has seen rapid growth over the last two years (ChatGPT up almost 3x since October 2023). In July 2025, OpenAI said that ChatGPT processes ~2.5bn prompts per day, i.e. ~912bn a year. In March, Google stated they process 5 trillion searches per year. This places ChatGBT at ~18% of Google's daily query volume, and this figure is rising. Google's Gemini is also on the rise, reportedly gaining 200m+ users over the last 6 months, and itself was Google's top trending search term in 2025. The company also treats AI Overviews as the future of Google search UX. Using LLMs/ AI search tools as an alternative to traditional search gives rise to zero-click / no-click searching, where sufficient information can be gained without the need to click on further links to visit websites. See our example in Exhibit 10.

Digiday data (source) shows no-click searches for news rising from ~56% to nearly 69% after AI Overviews rolled out in the US in May 2024. The data also suggests that organic visits can drop -34% to 79% when AI previews appear in search. Impact on search traffic is evident. When we look at sites that do not rely on re-direction for a specific function (online shopping, input) such as information providers, news publishers, blogs and forums, the declining trend is clear. This is tied directly to broader shifts in search.

Could the decline in open-web search affect Epsilon's data collection capabilities?

We don't expect lower open web traffic to have a negative impact on Epsilon's data collection... When we started doing work on this topic, this was our biggest concern. However, we have held industry expert calls with recent former employees of Epsilon who said that only a minority of the data (one expert mentioned around 10%) collected by Epsilon comes from the open web. In an extreme scenario where open web searches were to fall significantly to close to zero, Epsilon's ability to collect data would not be much impacted as its data mostly comes from partnerships with brands, retailers, banks and others who upload their data to Epsilon's platform and partners' data doesn't depend much on open web traffic. We don't expect Epsilon's partners' data to reduce on the retailer side even in a scenario where online shopping moves to zero-click as the retailers would still receive data from their customers and their purchase details. We came away reassured from these calls, as Epsilon's data ownership is a large component of our Overweight investment thesis on Publicis.

Could PUB's open web display ad activation business decline? Could alternative channels represent a growth opportunity?

...however, Publicis and Epsilon's ad activation business will need to adapt to shifting trends on ad spend. This is not something that we had thought about when we first started researching the topic. However, it was mentioned as a potential risk and opportunity by all the experts we spoke to. Most of Epsilon's Digital business (which makes up a bit less than half of Epsilon's revenue but a larger portion of profit) comes from display advertising, which is ads activation on pre-defined audiences via banner advertising on the open web. This is the part of the business that could be impacted by lower open web traffic. A smaller part of Epsilon's Digital business comes from video (e.g. connected TV 'CTV' and on-the-device videos 'OTD') where Epsilon offers a tool that taps into its data asset and allows media planners to use filters to find an audience to target on CTV and OVD, similar to what they offer for open web display buying. For example, the platform allows users to search for

an audience that meets certain criteria: "I want to target adults aged 25-35 that have purchased from a competitor in the last 6 months and have not purchased from me in the last year and I want to purchase from different video providers including Netflix, Roku, Prime, YouTube and Samsung." We see an opportunity for alternative channels advertising to make up for the decline in open web display advertising: - · Publicis and Epsilon are independent players whose selling point is to optimise return on ad spend for their clients, as they do not favour any media providers. M Therefore, they have full flexibility to shift to channels that make more sense for their clients to advertise on.

· We think the following alternative channels can make up for the potential fall in open web display advertising: 1) video (CTV and OVD), 2) Digital Audio, and 3) advertising on AI-powered LLM platforms. · Video advertising: One of the industry experts we spoke to shared that Epsilon's Video activation business has been growing very fast (double digit %) but that this business comes at a lower margin than the display ad business due to the high price of video advertising and the lower supply. Publicis makes most of its margin in the Media business on the strategic advice to clients and how to best allocate media spend by leveraging data, therefore we think a potential shift to selling less ad display and more videos should not have a significant impact on Publicis at group level.

· AI assistants/search summaries advertising: The LLM platforms have talked about introducing advertising to their platforms. Google has explicitly said that as it rolls out AI Overviews, ads will appear both within and below the AI answer block. While OpenAI had said in the past that ads are on the radar, it has recently announced it would delay the plan for "broader advertising products" as it focuses on improving ChatGPT quality amidst rising competition. · We note that social media is not an opportunity for alternative channel advertising as most of the players are walled gardens. · In our view, it is likely that Publicis and Epsilon are successful at grasping the opportunity in Video advertising activation, should there be a significant decline in demand for open web advertising.

Does the channel mix shift increase the threat of disruption of Publicis and our broader ad agency coverage? The way we answer this question is: is the landscape becoming less complex and less fragmented with the potential decline in open web search at the expense of CTV/video? Ad agencies provide value to their typically large global corporate clients by helping them navigate the complex and fragmented media landscape. · We don't believe the shift away from open web display ads and search would significantly reduce the complexity of the media landscape · We think Epsilon's deterministic data models (near 100% accuracy) offer a significant value-add for advertisers wanting to work with an independent partner Exhibit 15: Overview of the key players in CTV and videos Source: Morgan Stanley Research M Exhibit 16: Overview of the key LLM platforms Launch: November 2022 Monthly Visits: 6.5bn Launch: March 2023 Monthly Visits: 1.2bn Launch: July 2023 Monthly Visits: 197m Launch: January 2025 Monthly Visits: 355m

Epsilon's data comes from hundreds of partnerships whereby Epsilon receive demographic and transactional data. Their partnerships include brands, retailers, credit card providers and other data suppliers that provide car registrations databases, new movers databases, among others. Epsilon has been building its partnerships with data providers for the past several decades. From this they are able to derive deterministic models, which match or identify consumers using known, verifiable, exact identifiers. They are superior and more accurate than probabilistic models that use statistical inference to predict consumer behaviour using partial signals. How good is Epsilon? Industry experts we discussed with talked to the remarkably rich data and ID graph Epsilon has with many attributes on each consumer. We also heard good feedback on the integration of Epsilon to Publicis, which took a long time (the most challenging part was the cultural one, as Epsilon's business models differs from the mostly time and materials model of Publicis).

According to an industry expert we spoke to, Publicis' market share gains are partly driven by the fact that Publicis brings "a viable independent alternative to the data-rich walled gardens" for large global corporates looking to make data-driven decisions when it comes to their ad spend and work with an independent player. Other factors industry experts mentioned include the deep involvement of CEO Arthur Sadoun in numerous pitches. What are some examples of what Epsilon can do? Epsilon can create audiences for first party and third party ad activations: · 1) First party activation example that leverages the brand's first party data: ° First party data provided by the brand: previous customers who have not M

° Epsilon's data provides insights into the brand's customers: of these previous customers, they identify specific criteria that signal they are more likely to respond to the ad campaign and make a purchase: the ones who are looking to move home or have recently moved and exclude the ones that recently purchased from a competitor. · 2) Third party activation example: the brand wants 3 million prospects in a specific age range that have never engaged with the brand and that meet specific criteria including looking to move home, have moved home in the past 6 months or have recently purchased products that signal they would respond positively to the ad. Epsilon's data models can offer multiple types of filter to find the consumers who are most likely to be converted to a buyer.

How does Omnicom's Acxiom compete with Epsilon? According to industry experts that we spoke to, Publicis integrated Epsilon better than IPG (now part of Omnicom) did with Acxiom. This can also be partly evidenced by the diverging growth performances, with Publicis performing better than IPG. Our industry expert discussions suggested Acxiom is a high quality asset, so if Omnicom can integrate the asset well to the relevant businesses, it could become a strong competitor to Publicis/Epsilon from a data capabilities perspective. However, we note that the integration can take time and be challenging from a cultural perspective, given the deep integration required across different business models while Publicis is focused on deepening the integration, which could allow it to stay ahead.

We value Havas using a 10-year DCF with a 9.5% WACC and 1.0% terminal growth rate. The higher WACC vs peers (Publicis and WPP) reflects the stock's lower liquidity.

n Successful execution of plan for significant margin expansion (business integration, cross-selling, streamlining of lower-margin smaller countries operations) n Faster improvement in macro environment n Successful M&A improving scale and strengthening product

n AI causes disruption to ad agencies industry n Execution challenges n US healthcare advertising regulation adversely impacting Havas

We value Publicis using a 10-year DCF with an 8.5% WACC and 1.5% terminal growth rate.

n Faster macroeconomic rebound n Successful expansion of Epsilon's US data capabilities into Europe n Strong traction in retail media and influencer marketing n Successful M&A strengthening product offering

n Peers catch up to Publicis in terms of product offering and operational efficiencies n Increasing insourcing of creative work and going direct for media buying n GenAI challenges the business

We value S4 using a DCF model with a 12% WACC and 1.5% long-term growth rate. Our higher WACC than we use for Publicis and WPP reflects 1) the higher cyclicality and uncertainty of the business (high client concentration and high exposure to one client's sector - 40% of revenue from technology clients) and 2) the relatively lower liquidity of the stock.

n S4 is a small player and has considerable scope for incremental growth as digital grows in the marketing mix n Fast recovery in tech clients' ad spend n Success of the AI ad tech consulting business

- n Inadequacies in company structure have led to issues relating to audit delays and head- M count budget n High client concentration n AI pressures the business

We value WPP using a 10-year DCF where we apply an 8.5% WACC and 0.5% terminal growth rate.

n New business wins n Margin improvement on the back of restructuring n Special situations

n More business losses n AI challenges the business and more companies in-housing creative work and going direct for media buying n Execution challenges Foundation M

Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold and sell. Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone. In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice. An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations.

Overweight (O). The stock's total return is expected to exceed the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Equal-weight (E). The stock's total return is expected to be in line with the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Not-Rated (NR). Currently the analyst does not have adequate conviction about the stock's total return relative to the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. Underweight (U). The stock's total return is expected to be below the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months.

Unless otherwise specified, the time frame for price targets included in Morgan Stanley Research is 12 to 18 months.

Attractive (A): The analyst expects the performance of his or her industry coverage universe over the next 12-18 months to be attractive vs. the relevant broad market benchmark, as indicated below. In-Line (I): The analyst expects the performance of his or her industry coverage universe over the next 12-18 months to be in line with the relevant broad market benchmark, as indicated below.
