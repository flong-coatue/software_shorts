Price objective basis & risk Publicis Groupe (PGPEF / PUBGY) Our price objective of € 120 (ADR $35.4) is based 50/50 on a DCF (WACC 8.1%) and a target multiple of 14.5x 2026E P/E, in line with the market given organic sales growth is now firmly in line with GDP growth. Upside risks to our price objective are i) the global synchronized recovery leads to increased marketing spending, ii) Publicis actively repositions its assets, simplifying its structure, removing silos, or selling non-performing units, iii) the secular wave of consolidation returns, either between agencies or between consultancies and agencies. Downside risks to our price objective are i) if Publicis were to lose a big account and /or a large account decreases its media spending, ii) the macroeconomic environment decelerates abruptly, iii) consultancies have a bigger and earlier impact than expected, or iv) negative M&A news.

Publicis Groupe Maintain Buy, PO hiked €120 Alongside our primer on agencies (see Media & Internet: Agencies 2026 primer: The polar opposites 29 January 2026 ), we preview Publicis ' FY25 results due on Tuesday 3 rd February. We are cognizant that the key lesson from recent earnings for companies bucketed as at risk from AI is that it takes more than an in line print to flip sentiment. W hile we see limited scope for big positive surprises, we are confident earnings and FY26 outlook will disprove the structural bear case. The only wrinkle is FX, as the sliding $ (>60% of profits) hurts reported figures once again (3% impact in 2026) . FY25: top-end in sight Mid-November, Publicis CEO indicated the company was on track to hit the higher end of its 5.0-5.5% organic sales growth guidance. As macro trends have remained solid through the quarter and given the company '

s track-record, we assume 5.5%, implying 4Q25 +5.6% (consensus: +5.1%). Elsewhere, we are in line with expectations, projecting 18.2% operating margin (+20bp Y/Y, guidance is " slight increase " ) and € 7.47 headline EPS (consensus: € 7.50). We increase our PO to € 120/$35.40 from € 119 / $35 . FY26 outlook: similar on top-line, better on margin? We expect Publicis 2026 top-line outlook will be similar to 2025, i.e +4-5% supported by strong new business dynamics and positive underlying growth in Connected Media, with Sapient a possible source of future upside. Consensus already models +5.0% so the bar to surprise is pretty high. However, we note Publicis has built a solid track-record of guiding conservatively. With 1Q comps being relatively easier

, a record inflow of new business wins and a strong exit rate, the company should sound bullish on the start of the year, implying some upside to current consensus (+4.6%). Positive surprises may come from the operating margin guidance, as management has indicated potential for higher operational leverage going forward. We also look for an update on capital allocation in light of the strong balance sheet (0.4x Net Debt/EBITDA), high FCF and low share price valuation.

We rate Publicis Buy as we expect its financial performance will be increasingly different from peers given a higher proportion of revenue coming from the US, where it derives 30% of revenue from Sapient and Epsilon. We think Publicis would demonstrate stronger cost control and better FCF generation than peers during a downturn. Valuation appears to assume performance similar to that of peers.
