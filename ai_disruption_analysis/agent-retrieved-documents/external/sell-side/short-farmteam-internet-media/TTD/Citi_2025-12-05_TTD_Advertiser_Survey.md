05 Dec 2025 04:00:00 ET CITI'S TAKE We ran a media buyer survey in September (following our June survey) with Citi Innovation Lab, and, in our view, results show mixed takeaways for TTD and the competitive environment. TTD showed well (and better in certain places) relative to June, in areas like market share, total budget share, and best-performing DSP. But Amazon DSP (off O&O) adoption looks like it is increasing among programmatic advertisers with more spend coming from TTD than previously, although still plenty looks like its potentially incremental and coming from others. The CTV macro looks healthy with more advertisers expecting to spend more on CTV over the next year. We were surprised by certain responses, like views on inventory integrations being a differentiator after so much was democratized this year (it might just still be early), and there were some conflicting/contradictory answers. We aimed to be as consistent as possible with our June survey.

We surveyed 40 large media buyers in September (as a follow-up to our June survey) regarding the CTV/programmatic/DSP landscape and had the following takeaways: 1) CTV ad macro is healthy with 72% of CTV advertisers expecting to increase spend next year (up from 50% in June) and 74% over the next three (80% in June); 2) TTD remains the market share leader with 80% of respondents using it (70% in June) and 32% budget share, which is higher than the 28% in June and materially highest among DSPs; 3) TTD improved as the best-performing DSP, #1 in all five categories we surveyed and better than our previous survey in June; 4) But advertisers are expecting to spend more on Amazon DSP Offsite, and TTD is seen as more of a funding source among advertisers than it was in our June survey, clearly one of the larger concerns among investors; 5) 30% of advertisers see Amazon as a direct competitor to TTD, while 38% see

it as complementary; 6) The DSP market is more competitive with 73% citing more DSP options than two years ago, and continued price discounting; 7) Kokai sentiment remains more positive than negative with 56% positive responses vs 16% outright negative when compared to Solimar (an improvement from June), but this was before the reported forced migration (AdWeek, 11/20/25), which might have some impact here.

Survey Details: We surveyed 40 media buyers with total ad budgets over $30mm with the vast majority spending at least $1mm programmatically. We had 27 respondents return from our June survey, which should be taken into account when analyzing trends between the two surveys. Respondents were evenly split between brands (55%) and agencies (45%) and focused on decision makers (15% C-Suite, 85% VP/Director level). While we focus on CTV (80% of respondents spent on CTV), unless otherwise specified survey results include programmatic more broadly. We bifurcated Amazon DSP spending between on Amazon O&O inventory (ie, Prime Video or sponsored products) and inventory off Amazon, referring to the former as Amazon DSP Onsite and the latter as Amazon DSP Offsite. Field work was conducted in September 2025. Key Survey Findings CTV Budget Trends Remain Healthy

On a macro level, our September survey found CTV accounts for ~22% of large advertisers’ digital advertising budgets and is expected to grow in the coming years, with both observations slightly more favorable than our June survey. Of the 35 respondents who spend on CTV (vs 30 in June), there remains a wide range with some allocating as much as 80% of their digital budget to CTV (vs. 60% in June), and as little as 5% (likely just testing in the channel). The 22% average in our September survey is up slightly from the 19% average in June, and while a solid budget allocation share, we continue to see upside to allocation with ~half of respondents currently at 20% or below.

No meaningful change to programmatic’s share of CTV buying with biddable programmatic still at 33%. Our September edition found a similar portion of CTV buys conducted through biddable programmatic at 33%. Generally, we think the shift to fully biddable programmatic has been slower than expected. Programmatic guaranteed represented 38% of buys (vs 36%) in June as direct was 29% (vs 31% in June). While we wouldn’t expect a major shift here within a quarter, this point is key for TTD as this is the vast majority of its CTV spend. How this shifts over time (ie, at what pace and ultimately to what share) will be key to TTD’s CTV growth and TAM opportunity.

CTV spend expectations remain healthy with more respondents in our September edition anticipating increasing spend next year with a similar majority increasing spend over the next three. Over the next year, 72% of respondents expect CTV budgets to increase between 1-20%, compared to 50% in our June edition. Only 17% expect no change in spend (vs 40% in June), while 12% expect a decrease between 1-20% (vs 10% in June). On a three-year timeframe, 74% expect to increase CTV budgets, compared to 80% in our June survey. However, a higher portion of respondents in September expect higher levels of spend increases with 60% at 10-20%+, compared to 43% in June. 15% expect to decrease CTV budgets, a higher portion than in June of 6%, while 11% expected no change in spend. Overall, we find this supportive of CTV’s continued growth and as a growing channel within digital advertising.

TTD, Amazon, & Google DSP Still Leaders; TTD Share More Favorable Than June Iteration Our September survey once again found TTD the most used DSP, but Amazon DSP is gaining ground. 80% of respondents indicated they use TTD (vs 70% in June), ahead of Amazon DSP Onsite at 55% (same as June), Amazon DSP Offsite at 48% (vs 38% in June), DV360 at 40% (vs 38% in June), and Criteo at 38% (same as June). With only 27 repeat respondents in our September survey we’re cognizant of putting too much weight into the delta of responses equating to share gains. That said, from these results it does look as if TTD remains the dominant DSP, but that Amazon is gaining share and growing usage while advertisers are using a broader set of DSPs.

TTD was the clear leader in budget allocation, more than double the next DSP. TTD’s budget share was notable again as respondents in September indicated 32% of programmatic spend is allocated to TTD (vs 28% in June). This is more than double the next closest which is Amazon DSP Onsite (13%, vs 16% in June), DV360 (11%, vs 15% in June), Yahoo (10%, vs 5% in June), Criteo (9%, vs 8% in June), and Amazon DSP Offsite (8%, vs 11% in June). Interestingly, according to our survey, while overall usage of Amazon DSP offsite went up survey over survey, the share of dollar spend declined. This continues to support the view TTD remains the preferred DSP among larger advertisers, and its budget allocation gap indicates to us that TTD likely remains the primary DSP right now.

Out of five key DSP qualities, TTD ranked first (or tied) in all five and remained well ahead of all DSPs on the aggregated score ranking. Our survey asked which DSP was best associated with access to inventory, access to data, best overall platform technology, best tools/insights/reporting, and ease of use. TTD’s ranking improved in our September iteration from June, ranking first across all five categories (it tied with DV360 on best tools/insights), up from four in June as ease of use improved from T-2 in June. This led to TTD’s aggregated score improving slightly to 1.0 from 1.2 in June and ahead of DV360 (2.4), Amazon DSP Onsite (3.0), StackAdapt (4.8), and Amazon DSP Offsite (5.2).

TTD extends leadership position for best access to inventory despite expanding CTV partnership announcements from other large DSPs. We were surprised to see TTD’s share of responses increase to 45% from 28% in June and become the clear leader in inventory access. We’ve observed a theme of inventory democratization this year with other large DSPs (ie, Amazon and Yahoo!) gaining access to key partners like Netflix, Roku, and Disney (including direct integrations and access to biddable live sports) and had expected some impact to TTD here. It is possible some of these announcements are not yet live and as they ramp could impact responses over time, and we’ll continue to monitor this closely in future surveys. But still, we find it notable TTD continues to do so well (and improve) here.

TTD remains a leader in access to data despite none of its own O&O 1P data and as other DSPs expand partnerships. TTD’s position of having the best access to data was relatively unchanged in our September survey from June despite recent partnership announcements at other DSPs. 33% of respondents ranked TTD as having the best access to data, down two points from June, and ahead of Amazon DSP for onsite spend at 20% (vs 10% in June) and DV360 at 10% (vs 23% in June) while Amazon DSP for offsite spend remained at 5%. With data an increasingly important asset for advertisers, we find results here favorable for TTD as its network of data partners, including those with retail data, continues to resonate with advertisers.

TTD extends its lead as top rank for best among platform technology. TTD again received the most responses for best platform technology, but it also saw its share of responses meaningfully increase to 48% from 30% in June. TTD’s share was 33pts ahead of the next DSP, Amazon DSP for offsite spend, compared to a 7pt lead from June. We find this notable given the polarizing rollout of Kokai, which, while garnering headlines, doesn’t seem to have changed advertiser perception on TTD’s overall tech stack, at least not yet. Also interesting was Amazon DSP for offsite spend improving 5pts from June to 15% and the second-most-cited DSP for platform technology as it continues to invest in its platform.

TTD ranks as being tied with DV360 for most associated with having the best insights and reporting among DSPs and ranking first for ease of use. Most interesting here is TTD ranking first on ease of use (28%), 3pts ahead of DV360 and 15pts ahead of StackAdapt. Notably, TTD moved from T-2 in June and improved its response share by 10pts from our June survey, potentially indicating that despite all the negative press on Kokai it has been better received by clients.

ROAS again was the top ranked reason advertisers choose a DSP, according to our survey, as take rate remains much less of a priority at #5 and falling one spot from our June survey. While the debate around TTD’s ability to maintain its 20% take rate is increasing, advertisers continue to indicate to us that take rate alone is not a deciding factor when choosing a DSP; a sentiment we’ve also heard during our checks in the past. We were not surprised to see ROAS retain its spot as the top-ranked choice when choosing a DSP. But we did find it interesting that access to inventory saw its share of responses increase 7pts from our June survey (to 25%) even as inventory access seems to be democratizing across the large DSPs.

~70% of respondents see Amazon DSP Offsite with potential to be their primary DSP, a modest improvement from our June survey. While just 7% of respondents who use Amazon DSP also use it as their primary (same as June), 61% believe it could serve as their primary DSP, up from 52% in June. Given recent announcements, we are not surprised to see more advertisers viewing Amazon DSP as a viable option and does present a growing longer-term risk for TTD. Though with still 7% using Amazon DSP as the primary and TTD’s strong showing in our market share and adoption questions above (Figures 6-7), we remain balanced here.

Respondents remain split as to whether Amazon DSP Offsite is complementary or directly competitive with TTD. Respondents remained slightly more skewed to Amazon DSP for offsite spend more complementary to their TTD buys (38%) compared to those who see it more directly competitive (30%). And compared to our June survey, complementary responses improved slightly, from 35%. To us, Figure 20 (and Figures 16-17) make it hard to see Amazon not growing as a competitor, but at the same time a higher skew still seeing Amazon DSP as more complementary means TTD continues to play an important role in the DSP landscape as well.

1P data and Amazon Marketing Cloud the top two reasons Amazon DSP wins, while conflict of its O&O inventory and still lack of premium inventory integrations are roadblocks to more spend. For why advertisers (who could/are using Amazon DSP as their primary DSP) would spend more on Amazon DSP off O&O, ROAS fell from the top reason cited in June to being tied for third (response rate falling to 29% vs 57%). 1P data remained important (now first at 76% vs second at 50% in June), while the ability to leverage Amazon Marketing Cloud was the second-most-cited reason this time at 47% (vs 21%). Regarding roadblocks to Amazon DSP becoming a primary DSP, concerns around Amazon’s potential conflict of interest favoring its O&O inventory remained a key concern and cited by 44% of respondents. And while access to premium inventory is still a key concern, we’d expect this impediment to ease over time as Amazon has recently

gained access to notable CTV partnerships (including Netflix, and direct integrations with Roku and Disney). Interestingly, inferior technology was cited by 44% compared to 0% last time. However, we note the smaller sample sizes here when drawing conclusions.

The vast majority of survey respondents using Amazon DSP Offsite expect to increase spend, potentially indicating share gains, with Amazon’s recent CTV partnerships helping drive this. 74% of respondents who already use Amazon DSP Offsite plan to increase spend on it over the next 12 months, similar to our June iteration’s 80%. 53% expect a 1-10% increase and 21% a 10-20% increase. Just 5% expect to decrease spend (<10%). This continues to read positive for Amazon’s DSP Offsite, especially given the large advertiser orientation of our survey. And the vast majority of those expecting to increase spend on Amazon DSP Offsite said its recent CTV partnership and integration announcements have led to an increase in budget allocation (79%).

In contrast to our June survey, most respondents who expect to increase spend on Amazon DSP off Amazon O&O now see spend coming from TTD budgets. 57% of respondents in our September survey who use Amazon DSP Offsite and expect to increase spend next year see a portion of this increase coming from TTD budgets, notably higher from just 25% in our June survey. To be clear, this is a smaller subset of advertisers within our survey (14 qualified for this question and 8 indicated TTD as a funding source), and respondents here could also choose multiple options and did not specify the magnitude of budget shifts. Overall incremental budget increase and budget shift from other non-TTD DSPs were also highly cited, 50%, as funding sources. That said, we still find the increase in those citing TTD as a funding source notable as this is a key area of concern for investors and directionally is something we’ve begun to pick up more in some of our more recent checks.

Of those who are migrating spend from TTD, fees are now the clear reason for shifting spend to Amazon. Though different this time was 1P data and AI tools cited at a much lower rate as key reasons for shifting spend. While sample sizes here are towards the lower end, these results of TTD budgets shifting to Amazon are supported by some of our recent ad checks and news reports earlier this year (AdWeek, June 5,25). And this is likely to reinforce more bearish investors that TTD’s take rate is likely to come under more pressure. Note respondents could choose more than one option (both Figure 22 & 23).

Our September iteration found the DSP environment continues to become more competitive with more choices available and that there continues to be more overall price discounting observed. 73% of respondents noted the number of competitive DSP options has increased over the past two years, up slightly from our June survey of 68%. This compares to 15% seeing no change (vs 20% in June) and 13% seeing a decline (same as June). While price discounting continues to be less of a factor than overall DSP choice, once again our survey indicated there is more discounting (41%) than not (14%) from DSPs, with September results moderately higher in respondents seeing more increases in discounting than in June (41% vs 34%).

Looking at specific DSPs, 42% of respondents noted Amazon DSP Offsite offered more discounts than two years ago while TTD remained below market average. For Amazon Offsite, this 42% represented a slightly lower amount than our June survey (47%) who had seen more discounting, but not a large difference. TTD saw a very slight uptick to 34% (from 32% in June) but remains below the group average and its closest competitors (DV360, Amazon, and Yahoo!). TTD seeing little change to higher discounting and remaining below the group average compares to Amazon DSP Onsite seeing an +18pt increase from our June survey to 41%, with Yahoo! +14pts to 36%, and DV360 +11pt to 38%.

Kokai Sentiment Remains More Positive Than Negative; No Indication Rollout Lowering Spend

Our September survey held similar sentiment to June on the Kokai platform with responses again more positive than negative and limited indication that its rollout has led to lower spend. 56% of respondents who use TTD gave a positive leaning answer to how Kokai performs compared to Solimar (50% in June), while only 16% gave an outright negative response (18% in June). And despite some news reports indicating advertisers have shifted spend away from TTD due to the polarizing Kokai rollout (AdWeek, 11/20/25), just 13% of respondents said they had spent less on TTD as a result of the Kokai rollout (although our survey was taken before the reportedly forced move to Kokai in recent weeks). The vast majority (69%) have not seen any direct impact while 19% said it has actually led to higher spend (Figure 33). We expect this to remain a debate among investors, and the recent changes to Kokai’s UI and new data marketplace pricing (TTD Press Release) are unlikely to improve sentiment among more

Following our survey results, we continue to be positive on Amazon’s DSP and its strategic opportunity to grow ad budgets on the platform, as the survey shows that adoption is growing. 55% of respondents said they currently use Amazon's DSP (O&O) and 48% use it for off-AMZN spend, which is up materially from the 38% in the June survey. This compares to 80% for TTD and 40% for Google’s DV360, highlighting an opportunity to grow spend as new partners like Roku and Disney join Amazon’s DSP. We note that 74% of respondents who already use Amazon’s DSP plan to increase spend over the next 12 months with ~67% of respondents viewing Amazon’s DSP Offsite as potentially their primary DSP over time. Access to Amazon’s 1P data (76%) and ability to leverage Amazon Marketing Cloud (47%) were cited as the top 2 reasons respondents would spend more on Amazon’s DSP outside of Prime Video inventory.

Amazon remains a top pick across the Internet sector as its retail division continues to gain share of offline spend, while its advertising business extends beyond Amazon’s O&O to newer platforms while greater efficiencies expand retail margins. Key here, we look for AWS to accelerate revenue growth into 2026 as greater infrastructure capacity comes online. We currently project Amazon Advertising revenue to reach $69 billion (+22% Y/Y) in 2025 and $82 billion (+20%) in ‘26E. Appendix: Details on Survey Respondents Survey Focuses on Larger Ad Budgets

Our survey focused on 40 large advertisers with over $30mm of total spend, with most spending at least $1mm of programmatic spend. Of our 40 respondents, 20% had ad budgets of $30mm-$50mm, 38% had budgets of $50mm-$100mm, and 43% had budgets over $100mm. This was a slightly higher distribution than our survey from June ‘25. Breaking this down to programmatic spend, 3% did have less than $1mm of programmatic spend, 13% between $1mm-$5mm annually, 10% spend $5mm-$10mm, 23% spend $10mm-$20mm, 25% spend $20mm-$50mm, and 28% spend $50mm or more on programmatic channels, a slightly higher distribution compared to our June ’25 survey.

| The Trade Desk, Inc. operates a cloud-based, self-service platform that allows advertising buyers to create, manage, and optimize their digital advertising campaigns across a multitude of ad formats, including display, video, audio, native, and social. Ad buyers can also control campaigns across various devices such as computers, mobile devices, and connected TV (CTV). The Trade Desk integrates data, inventory, and publishing partners that allow buyers to maximize their reach. The company generates revenue through a take-rate on the gross spend that flows through the platform, which has been in a steady range of 18%-20% for the past 8 years. Customers include advertising agencies served through master service agreements, though brands are also increasingly becoming direct customers of the Trade Desk, and some are served through joint business partnerships. The Trade Desk was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in Ventura, CA.                                                 |

| We rate The Trade Desk Neutral. While we view TTD as well placed to benefit from secular tailwinds like CTV and Retail Media with scale and data advantages, a breakdown in seasonal growth trends is leading to visibility into TTD returning to 20%+ growth, in our view. Without this growth outlook, we find the risk/reward skew to be fairly valued at its current valuation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Our target price of $50 per share is based on an even weighting of our projected DCF ($55, on 11% WACC, 5% terminal growth rate), 2026E EV/Revenue multiple (6.0x), and 2026E EV/EBITDA multiple (18.0x). We justify our valuation on peer multiples and our lower conviction in TTD returning to 20%+ growth as our multiples are below respective 10-year averages of 14x and 40x.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| This stock is High Risk based upon our quantitative model, but assigning a High Risk rating is not supporte given, industry share gain, and a growing competitive moat.  Downside risks to our target price include: 1) Programmatic in CTV adopts slower than expected; 2) CTV grows slower than anticipated, which is important as CTV has accounted for the majority of TTD’s growth more recently; 3) advertising budgets shift more to the walled gardens, areas TTD does not have access to; 4) higher competition within programmatic has a negative impact on pricing, leading to take-rate compression for TTD; and 5) loss of large advertising agencies could lead to material revenue loss as clients aggregated under Publicis comprise over 10% of gross billings.

| Our $320 target price is based on ~33x our ‘27E GAAP EPS of $9.68. We justify our valuation multiple given AWS’ reaccelerating growth, progress in adding capacity, backlog trends, and improving efficiencies across its retail business. We note Amazon’s leading position within AWS and eCommerce, its Prime membership base, growing online advertising business, and improving overall margins, which combined deserve a premium to the market, in our view. We note our $320 TP implies a ’27E EV/EBITDA multiple of 13x, which is a discount to Amazon’s median FY EV/EBITDA multiple of ~18x over the last 10 years. |

Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings: Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned. Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3)

for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi Research may suspend its rating and target price and assign “Rating Suspended” status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi Research may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—“ and “-“ respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi Research assigned “Under Review” status to both situations

and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk. Catalyst Watch/Short Term Views (“STV”) Ratings Disclosure:

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV

Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price

movement will not materialize as expected. RESEARCH ANALYST AFFILIATIONS / NON-US RESEARCH ANALYST DISCLOSURES The legal entities employing the authors of this report are listed below (and their regulators are listed further herein). Non-US research analysts who have prepared this report (i.e., all research analysts listed below other than those identified as employed by Citigroup Global Markets Inc.) are not registered/qualified as research analysts with FINRA. Such research analysts may not be associated persons of the member organization (but are employed by an affiliate of the member organization) and therefore may not be subject to the FINRA Rule 2241 restrictions on communications with a subject company, public appearances and trading securities held by a research analyst account. OTHER DISCLOSURES Any price(s) of instruments mentioned in recommendations are as of the prior day’s market close on the primary market for the instrument, unless otherwise stated.

The completion and first dissemination of any recommendations made within this research report are as of the Eastern date-time displayed at the top of the Product. If the Product references views of other analysts then please refer to the price chart or rating history table for the date/time of completion and first dissemination with respect to that view. Regulations in various jurisdictions require that where a recommendation differs from any of the author’s previous recommendations concerning the same financial instrument or issuer that has been published during the preceding 12-month period that the change(s) and the date of that previous recommendation are indicated. For fundamental coverage please refer to the price chart or rating change history within this disclosure appendix or the issuer disclosure summary at https://www.citivelocity.com/cvr/eppublic/citi_research_disclosures.

Citi Research has implemented policies for identifying, considering and managing potential conflicts of interest arising as a result of publication or distribution of investment research. A description of these policies can be found at https://www.citivelocity.com/cvr/eppublic/citi_research_disclosures. The proportion of all Citi Research research recommendations that were the equivalent to "Buy","Hold","Sell" at the end of each quarter over the prior 12 months (with the % of these that had received investment firm services from Citi in the prior 12 months shown in brackets) is as follows:

Q3 2025 Buy 33% (61%), Hold 44% (52%), Sell 23% (50%), RV 0.4% (80%); Q2 2025 Buy 33% (63%), Hold 44% (51%), Sell 23% (49%), RV 0.4% (86%); Q1 2025 Buy 33% (63%), Hold 44% (51%), Sell 23% (49%), RV 0.5% (87%); Q4 2024 Buy 32% (64%), Hold 44% (52%), Sell 23% (44%), RV 0.4% (92%). For the purposes of disclosing recommendations other than for equity (whose definitions can be found in the corresponding disclosure sections), "Buy" means a positive directional trade idea; "Sell" means a negative directional trade idea; and "Relative Value" means any trade idea which does not have a clear direction to the investment strategy.

Citi Research broadly and simultaneously disseminates its research content to the Firm’s institutional and retail clients via the Firm’s proprietary electronic distribution platforms (e.g., Citi Velocity and various Global Wealth platforms). As a convenience, certain, but not all, research content may be distributed through third party aggregators. Clients may receive published research reports by email, on a discretionary basis, and only after such research content has been broadly disseminated. Certain research is made available only to institutional investors to satisfy regulatory requirements. The level and types of services provided by Citi Research analysts to clients may vary depending on various factors such as the client’s individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communications from analysts, the client’s risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g. market-wide, sector specific, long term, short-term etc.), the size and scope of the overall client relationship with the Firm and legal and regulatory

constraints. Pursuant to Comissão de Valores Mobiliários Resolução 20 and ASIC Regulatory Guide 264, Citi is required to disclose whether a Citi related company or business has a commercial relationship with the subject company. Considering that Citi operates multiple businesses in more than 100 countries around the world, it is likely that Citi has a commercial relationship with the subject company.

Securities recommended, offered, or sold by the Firm: (i) are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (ii) are not deposits or other obligations of any insured depository institution (including Citibank); and (iii) are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the principal amount invested. The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus. Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred to in

this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. Statements and views concerning ESG (environmental, social, governance) factors are typically based upon public statements made by the affected company or other public news, which the author may not have independently verified. ESG factors are one consideration that investors may choose to examine when making investment decisions. All opinions, projections and estimates constitute the judgment of the author as of the date of the Product and these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product.

Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to news affecting the issuer. For non-fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Where a component of a published trade idea is subject to a restriction, the trade idea will be removed from any list of open trade ideas included in the Product. Upon the lifting of the restriction, the trade idea will either be re-instated in the open trade ideas list if the analyst continues to support it or it will be officially closed. Citi Research may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long-term or short-term investment

horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is consistent with the rating system for each respective product.

Investing in non-U.S. securities, including ADRs, may entail certain risks. The securities of non-U.S. issuers may not be registered with, nor be subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There may be limited information available on foreign securities. Foreign companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for exact dividend computations.

or other jurisdictions from purchasing securities mentioned in the Product from the Firm. Please ask your Financial Consultant for additional details.
