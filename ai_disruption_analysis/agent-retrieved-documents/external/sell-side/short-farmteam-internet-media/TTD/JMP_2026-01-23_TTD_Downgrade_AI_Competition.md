Downgrading Shares to MP Given Limited Near-Term Catalysts While Competition is Intensifying

· We are downgrading shares of The Trade Desk to Market Perform from Market Outperform, as we believe competitive intensity is increasing and near-term catalysts to positively inflect financial performance are limited. We believe generative AI is lowering switching costs across DSPs by simplifying the programmatic buying user interface, which we expect will further intensify competition within the DSP landscape. This dynamic is occurring as Amazon (AMZN, MO, $300 PT, Boone) already represents a growing competitive threat, supported by structural advantages driven by its access to the industry's largest retail media data set. In addition to rising competitive pressures, we see a lack of near-term catalysts that could meaningfully improve financial performance, leading us to view the risk/ reward profile as balanced at current levels. · The key points to our downgrade:

○ DSP competition is intensifying as we believe The Trade Desk's historical structural advantages are eroding. Competitive pressure continues to increase, particularly from Amazon, supported by its access to what we believe is the largest and most valuable retail media data set in the industry, enabling enhanced targeting and closed-loop measurement. While TTD has historically executed well by building deep agency relationships and establishing itself as the de facto programmatic buying platform, generative AI is reducing the operational complexity of programmatic advertising and lowering switching costs across DSPs. As a result, we believe access to unique, proprietary data is increasingly the key differentiator - dynamics that we believe favor Amazon. ○ Open web ad spend continues to slow. We believe open web advertising - excluding CTV and digital audio - remains under pressure as walled gardens continue to gain share of overall digital ad spend and AI-driven search and AI Overviews negatively impact publisher traffic and monetization. Taken together, we view these dynamics as structural headwinds to open web impression growth and ad spend going forward.

○ There are several factors that could pressure TTD's take rates. We believe Amazon has offered reduced fees to drive advertiser adoption, and that The Trade Desk has begun negotiating fees and offering incentives to certain clients in response, which we view as an incremental risk to take rates. In addition, the launch of Audience Unlimited in September 2025 shifted data pricing from an a la carte model to tiered, impression-based pricing (3.3%4.4% of impression costs). While broader data adoption could be accretive, adoption skewed toward existing heavy data users would likely be dilutive. Overall, we see multiple potential take rate headwinds entering 2026. · Valuation: Shares of TTD last closed at $36.82, implying shares trade for 11.2x 2027E EBITDA. The Trade Desk trades in line with comps. With increased competition and a lack of near-term catalysts, we believe the risk/reward in shares is balanced at current levels.

We expect walled garden platforms to continue gaining share of digital advertising spend. In Figure 1, we present our breakdown of U.S. digital advertising spend across walled gardens (Meta [META, MO, $900 PT, Boone], Google Search [GOOGL, MO, $385 PT, Boone], Amazon, YouTube, TikTok, Snap [SNAP, MP, Boone], Pinterest) and the open web. We believe walled gardens' share of U.S. digital advertising will continue to expand, particularly as enhanced AI-driven tools - such as Meta's Advantage+ and Google's Performance Max and Demand Gen - continue to improve targeting and performance capabilities.

Source: WPP, IAB, Company reports, Citizens JMP Securities, LLC Within the open web, format level trends remain mixed (Figure 2). While CTV and digital video continue to exhibit healthy growth, we believe open web display advertising has come under pressure as the format has matured and as AI-driven search and AI Overviews increasingly impact publisher traffic. To be clear, while our open web forecasts by format are likely imprecise at the margin, we believe we are directionally

correct regarding the underlying shifts in advertising spend. To illustrate the impact AI is having on open web display, a Pew Research study analyzing 68K search queries found that users clicked on results only 8% of the time when AI summaries were present, compared to 15% when they were not. In addition, Similarweb data shows zeroclick searches have increased meaningfully over the past two years, while organic traffic to news publisher sites declined sharply over the same period (Figure 3). DMG has reported nearly 90% declines in click-through rates to the Daily Mail where AI Overviews appear. We also highlight commentary from People.com's 3Q25 earnings call, which noted that advertising revenue declined 3% Y/Y, reflecting 'lower programmatic advertising revenue due to lower impression volumes driven by 6% declines in Core Sessions, due primarily to the impact of the increasing prominence of Google AI Overviews on Google search sessions.' Simply put, we believe AI search and AI Overviews are having a

material impact on open web display advertising, a trend we expect to worsen in 2026.

We believe current consensus estimates for The Trade Desk imply meaningful share gains in 2026. Comparing our open web forecasts above with consensus U.S. gross spend projections for TTD suggests accelerating share gains within open web advertising. We believe sustaining such gains is becoming increasingly challenging amid intensifying competition from other DSPs, including Amazon. In particular, we believe Amazon is aggressively leaning into its DSP offering, with reported fees as low as a 1% take rate for programmatic guaranteed deals to attract advertisers. Our checks across the ad-tech ecosystem confirm growing spend flowing through Amazon's DSP, although we believe adoption remains early. In 3Q25, Viant (DSP, MO, $16 PT) announced the addition of enterprise advertiser Molson Coors and disclosed a $250M enterprise client spend pipeline, as it appears Viant is taking share with enterprise advertisers. We also highlight emerging platforms such as Vibe.co,

which recently reached $100M in ARR with ~10K performance advertisers and is targeting $1B in revenue by 2028. While these newer and smaller DSPs are unlikely to materially impact TTD's business in the near term, we believe they underscore a broader trend among agencies and advertisers toward their willingness to test and transition to new DSP partners. We expect digital video and CTV to sustain healthy growth, but expect continued pressure on open web display spend.

We believe there are several structural shifts underway in the digital advertising ecosystem that are eroding The Trade Desk's historical competitive advantages.

 TTD's role as the default buying platform is being challenged in the AI era. Historically, The Trade Desk benefited from the operational complexity of programmatic advertising, which favored TTD given its deep partnerships with agencies, resulting in an industry training on TTD's platform. However, as AI functionality becomes embedded within DSP interfaces, we believe the sophistication required to operate a DSP is declining, lowering switching costs. We highlight Viant's AI platform, Viant AI, which we believe contributed meaningfully to recent enterprise client wins. Viant AI integrates generative AI across the advertising lifecycle - from planning and bidding to measurement and outcomes - through intuitive, chat-based interfaces and greater automation. Amazon has similarly integrated AI into its DSP via offerings such as Brand+ and Performance+, AI-powered campaign optimization tools designed to simplify planning and optimization based on

advertiser objectives. In late 2025, Amazon also announced the beta launch of Campaign Manager, which uses AI to unify sponsored ads and Amazon DSP within a single interface, followed by the launch of Ads Agent, an AI agent designed to simplify campaign planning, activation, and optimization. Taken together, we believe these offerings are materially reducing the complexity of operating DSPs and lowering switching costs across platforms.  Data is becoming the primary structural differentiator. As AI lowers operational barriers, we believe access to unique, proprietary data is increasingly the key determinant of platform differentiation. While TTD's third-party data marketplace offers advertisers access to differentiated third-party data, we believe the company lacks scaled, proprietary first-party data. We view this as a core reason for Amazon's recent DSP momentum, as it controls the industry's largest and most valuable retail media data set, which we believe can meaningfully enhance targeting and measurement outcomes.

We believe consensus implies meaningful share gains of open web ad spend, which we believe will be increasingly difficult with increased competition.

-  Inventory is no longer a differentiator as access to premium inventory has become increasingly ubiquitous across DSPs. In 4Q25, Netflix expanded its DSP partnerships to provide direct inventory access to Amazon DSP and AJA DSP in Japan, after announcing a similar partnership with Yahoo DSP in June. In October, Spotify (SPOT, MO, $800 PT) announced integrations with Amazon DSP and Yahoo DSP, providing programmatic access to its audio and video inventory. Additionally, after integrating with TTD, Roku (ROKU, MO, $160 PT) launched partnerships with Amazon DSP in 4Q25, enabling advertisers to reach ~80M logged-in CTV households across the combined Roku and Fire TV audience graphs through Amazon DSP. Collectively, we believe these developments highlight that open web and premium inventory is increasingly accessible across buying platforms.

We believe there are several key risks to TTD's take rates that could impact its revenue growth in 2026. Specifically, we believe these are: 1) increased competition from DSPs; 2) changes to data monetization under Audience Unlimited; and 3) mix-shift pressures from declining open web display spend.  Increased competition from DSPs . Digiday recently reported that The Trade Desk has been negotiating rates and offering incentives to certain agency partners to counter competitive pressure. This follows reports that Amazon has offered DSP fees as low as a 1% take rate for programmatic guaranteed deals. While the scope and breadth of these concessions remain unclear, we believe competitive intensity across the DSP landscape is increasing, particularly from Amazon, which can monetize advertising spend through multiple channels beyond DSP fees alone.

 Audience Unlimited alters data pricing mechanics. Audience Unlimited is a new AI-powered thirdparty data marketplace that scores and ranks data segments based on campaign relevance, offering access to thousands of curated segments from hundreds of data providers. A key element of this launch is a change in how TTD monetizes data. Historically, data was priced a la carte, resulting in opaque pricing and, we believe in some cases, negative ROI for advertisers due to high data costs. Under Audience Unlimited, TTD offers two pricing modes: 1) Performance Mode, which provides access to data at no incremental cost; and 2) Control Mode, which charges tiered impression-based fees of 3.3% or 4.4%. The impact on take rates depends on adoption. Broad adoption among advertisers that historically did not use data would likely be accretive, while adoption concentrated among existing heavy data users would likely be dilutive to take rates.

 Declining open web display spend may pressure mix. We believe open web display remains The Trade Desk's highest-margin format. As this format faces pressure from AI-driven search and AI Overviews, we believe mix-shift toward lower-margin formats could weigh on overall take rates. We believe a one-point reduction in take rate would result in 5% downside to 2026E consensus revenue and 12% downside to 2026E consensus EBITDA. In Figure 5, we outline a scenario in which take rates decline from ~20% - where they have remained since 2022 - to 19%, resulting in $166M of lost revenue. Importantly, we believe any take rate decline would flow entirely through to the bottom line, implying a similar $166M reduction in EBITDA, implying 12% downside to 2026E consensus EBITDA projections.

The Trade Desk's independence remains a key differentiator. We continue to believe TTD's lack of ownership over media inventory or retail operations positions it as an objective partner aligned with advertiser interests. By contrast, Amazon operates both as a retailer and a media owner through Prime Video, while Google owns and operates YouTube. To this point, data from the Google ad-tech remedies trial indicate an increasing share of spend allocated to YouTube. We believe TTD's objectivity remains a strategic advantage and supports its positioning as a trusted partner to advertisers.

The Trade Desk's platform has historically had high retention. We believe the company has deeply embedded its platform into agency and brand workflows, making switching costs meaningfully high. Industry checks suggest that transitioning off TTD would remain a heavy operational lift for many advertisers. This stickiness is reinforced by long-term joint business plans (JBPs), which deepen integration and drive higher spend over time. Roughly half of spend on TTD's platform comes from JBPs, and last quarter TTD disclosed that its JBP pipeline expanded by 80 agreements, adding to more than 180 live JBPs, representing billions in potential spend. While we believe AI is lowering switching costs structurally, we expect behavioral change to occur gradually.

We believe consensus forecasts call for meaningful deceleration ex-political. In Figure 7, we walk through what we believe consensus is implying for revenue growth in 2026 after backing out our estimates for political ad spend. We believe consensus implies an ~8 point deceleration in revenue in 2026. While we believe AI is impacting website traffic to many open web publishers, our estimates for slowing open web advertising spend may be too punitive, resulting in our implied share gains for TTD being too high in 2026.

Source: Visible Alpha, Company reports, Citizens JMP Securities, LLC Audience Unlimited could provide a net benefit to take rates.

We are lowering our 2026 estimates on revenue and EBITDA. We are lowering our 2026 revenue and EBITDA estimates by ~2% and ~6%, respectively, which places us 1% and 2% below consensus. For 2027, we are reducing our revenue and EBITDA estimates by ~3% and ~9%, respectively, and now stand ~2% below consensus on both metrics.

The Trade Desk provides advertisers with a software platform to help target and buy advertising campaigns using programmatic inventory. Advertisers can combine data with data from third-party vendors with The Trade Desk's to create personalized interactions while doing so across billions of ad impressions to create a highly targeted, at-scale campaign. The Trade Desk generates revenue by charging advertisers a fee to help them plan, buy, and measure ad campaigns based on the amount of spend that goes through its platform and given that we believe the vast majority of global ad spend will move to programmatic over time, we view The Trade Desk as likely to benefit from strong industry tailwinds.

Risks for The Trade Desk include: 1) competition from the most capitalized and advanced digital companies, although we believe The Trade Desk is differentiated given its approach to partnering with agencies; 2) long cash conversion cycles impact free cash flow, although with data revenue growing, The Trade Desk's cash conversion cycle could shorten; 3) take rates are likely to decline over time as advertisers receive more volume discounts, although we ultimately believe this is a positive point and data revenue could help offset this; and 4) desktop display, which is in secular decline, is a meaningful portion of revenue although new ad formats are growing quickly and are offsetting these declines.
