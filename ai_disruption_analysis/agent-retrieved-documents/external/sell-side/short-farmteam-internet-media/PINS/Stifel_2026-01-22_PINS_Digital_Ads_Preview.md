January 22, 2026 EARNINGS PREVIEW

Below, we offer our thoughts as we head into 4Q25 earnings. Commentary from our recent advertising checks suggest that 4Q got off to a slow start in October, though robust Black Friday / Cyber Monday and December spending led to a better-than-expected quarter in total. We believe this translates into general upside bias for 4Q numbers across our coverage (guidance delivered at low point of the quarter), though typical seasonality and some broader macro overhang (i.e. tariffs, consumer uncertainty) likely mean 1Q26 guidance may remain reserved despite an overall solid digital advertising backdrop. We prefer GOOGL into the print with solid fundamentals that are likely ahead of Street; the wildcard is incremental releases from OpenAI that are likely to show well vs. the latest Gemini - we think that's something to worry about after the print. TTD is one of our top picks for 2026, though we would prefer to get 1Q guidance out of the way, and we would be cautious with owning META into the print, given there is still room for '26 Totex/Capex guidance to

disappoint. We selectively revise some estimates and roll our TPs to NTM multiples. We outline our broader thoughts below.

The Big Picture: As we highlighted in our recent advertising checks note (link), digital ad spend improved throughout 4Q, driven by strong holiday spending. We view 4Q numbers as generally in a good spot and anticipate the strong advertising backdrop supports some upside bias across the digital ads group. Expectations for 1Q are limited with a seasonal lack of visibility following a strong holiday ad spend environment, recently rejuvenated uncertainty from tariffs likely equate to 1Q guidance that will be somewhat muted. We continue to hear mostly positive trends across Meta and Amazon, and Google budgets are holding up well in the near-term (though long-term AI advertising debate remains). We would categorize commentary on Snap and Pinterest as muted this quarter (smaller audiences get less attention), and we believe the continued commentary around competitive pressures from Amazon DSP impacting The Trade Desk are largely priced-in at this level.

· GOOGL: Our checks suggest that 4Q advertising results (both Search & YouTube) should be ahead of the Street and Cloud estimates seem reasonable here. The setup is a bit tougher than it has been, given the recent run following the latest Gemini release, but we see the stock working higher post-print if fundamentals shake out the way we expect. The wildcard here is what OpenAI releases in the coming months, which could lead to GOOGL taking a break from its rally. GOOGL remains one of our top picks in 2026.

· META: Despite commentary from our 4Q advertising checks supporting solid 4Q results (particular strength from Instagram Reels), we believe the bulk of investor attention will be centered on '26 totex / capex (particularly following the "Meta Compute" announcement). We believe there is some room for totex / capex estimates to tick higher (Stifel '26 ests +2% / +9% vs. Street) and would be cautious owning this one into the print. We marginally adjust Reality Labs operating income assumptions to account for recent headcount reductions, and we bring our multiple lower to reflect rejuvenated near-term scrutiny on ROI on AI investments.

· TTD: We expect relatively solid 4Q results, but believe the 1Q guide might be a bit lackluster given tough comps following the push-out from 4Q24 into 1Q25 post the company's large reorg that shifted some business around. TTD is one of our top picks for the year, but we're more inclined to get the 1Q guide out of the way before stepping in on the long side. We do believe the Amazon competitive pressures are baked-in at current levels, and we're modeling revenue acceleration throughout 2026 as the company not only laps tougher 2024 U.S. Political headwinds that negatively impacted 2025 growth rates, but tacks on a few tailwinds from the Olympics, World Cup, and U.S. Midterms - we believe it will make it tougher to make the AMZN share loss case when headline revenue growth is accelerating.

· PINS: While our checks continue to suggest the platform's lack of scale vs. competitors is weighing on its potential performance, improvements to the direct response products and the platform's growing roster of partnerships / new channel exposure (Amazon, Google Search, and now CTV) are garnering some growing attention from advertisers. We expect this one could rebound should 4Q numbers deliver some upside, though forward guidance has been underwhelming over the last handful of quarters - we're not convinced this quarter will be the exception. · SNAP: Our checks continue to skew negative, with pressure on the N.A. user base a particular pain point for advertisers. We believe this pressure isn't going away anytime soon (particularly with increasing international focus on teenager accounts) and increasing clarity on the TikTok story adds to the headwinds. Our outlook on SNAP remains negative, though note incremental color on the Perplexity deal this quarter could cause some near-term volatility and enthusiasm.

As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this report. Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making their investment decision.

· CRTO: We don't comp the headwind from Target / Uber changes until later this year, which means that any positive follow-through supported by the generally positive digital advertising backdrop remains limited. Questions around the long-term outlook of retail media advertising remain a key debate as Agentic Commerce solutions start to gain traction, though we note we'd expect some positivity to return here with a meaningful partnership announcement. Investors have been warming up to this one given current valuations and a potential for the 3Q redomicile to bring in a fresh/incremental investor base. · DV: We view the greater advertising backdrop as supportive of a solid 4Q25 print, though note the comp gets harder through 1H26 and it probably takes a few quarters before recently suppressed sentiment starts to inflect positive.

 Current OECD nominal GDP growth estimates and assume ad budgets will slightly grow as a percent of nominal GDP in the U.S. (ex-political) in 2025-27 - we note that U.S. advertising as a percent of GDP has averaged 1.23% since 1999, but has trended higher in recent years (a trend similar to that seen during the early growth of the Internet).  We add GroupM's U.S. Political ad spend estimates for 2025-27 to the above as we view those budgets as largely (if not completely) immune from any economic slowdown.  Outside of the U.S., we utilize GroupM's implied global (ex-U.S.) advertising growth estimates, and we assume digital continues to gain share in the U.S. and elsewhere. We outline our market share assumptions for GOOGL, META, AMZN, SNAP, PINS, and TTD. We do not make similar assumptions for DV and IAS (different business model), or CRTO (reported revenue is inconsistent relative to the companies mentioned above).

We conducted checks with three mid-sized advertising agencies during the second full week of January (one of these checks has visibility into some large agency Holdco budgets, which are also presented below). Overall, despite a relatively slow start to the quarter (October called out as weakest month), strong spending around BFCM and December led to a generally better-than-expected 4Q. This strength isn't fully flowing through into 1Q though, which is facing typical seasonal headwinds as well as some impact associated with lagging impacts from incremental tariffs put in place throughout 2025. In our note here, we offer paraphrased commentary. We continue to hear mostly positive trends across Meta and Amazon, and Google budgets appear to be holding up in the nearterm, though we expect a new advertising solution in ChatGPT likely kicks up debate around the long-term outlook. Commentary on The Trade Desk continues to suggest an industry focus on competitive pressures from Amazon, though we believe this is already largely priced-in at this level and becomes less of a debate going forward in 2026

(link). We would categorize commentary on Snap and Pinterest as muted this quarter, as platforms with larger / growing audiences (like Meta, Google, and TikTok) draw the most advertiser attention. We generally believe this commentary supports in-line to better 4Q25 results across our digital advertising coverage, though we expect the group may not offer overly robust guidance for 1Q26.

We have been tracking public commentary from some of the largest global advertisers (as well as some smaller ones) for several years; we've compiled recent commentary from marketers that, in aggregate, equate to ~5% of global advertising spend. In the table below, we offer a heat map to summarize our view of the commentary. On an advertising budget-weighted basis across these 14 companies, commentary suggests 47% of budgets are growing, 34% of ad budgets are stable, and 18% of ad budgets appear to be scaling back. We have added incremental commentary since the September version of this exercise, and we believe advertiser commentary suggests the overall health of the consumer has held up reasonably well despite uncertainty around tariffs and the current macroeconomic backdrop. Similarly, we believe advertiser budgets have held up so far to date, as commentary

has generally skewed stable to positive following the initial reaction post-Liberation Day (54% of budgets were growing in September, while 23% were being pared back, and 12% appeared stable). We acknowledge that this year has seen regularly fluctuating sentiment, though this analysis should provide a good baseline for how advertisers have reacted to various announcements as the year has progressed.

Social: 4Q active user trends were a general continuation of what we saw last quarter. Facebook MAUs continued to decline in the U.S. (-2% y/y) growth turned negative abroad (-1% y/y vs. flat y/y in 3Q). Instagram U.S. MAU growth continued at a steady +3% y/y (fifth consecutive quarter), while international growth ticked +1pt higher for the third consecutive quarter (reached +6% y/y in 4Q). Snapchat user growth continues to worsen globally, with MAU growth worsening ~1pt in both the U.S. (4Q: -5% y/y) and internationally (4Q: +6% y/y). Pinterest MAU

growth internationally remained steady at +9% y/y and ticked higher in the U.S. by +1pt (to +10% y/y in 4Q). MAU growth at TikTok notably improved in the U.S. (+11% y/y in 4Q vs. +7% y/y in 3Q) and remained stable for ex-U.S. MAUs (+7% y/y in 4Q). YouTube active user growth remained steady at +2% y/y in both the U.S. and internationally. Reddit and X continue to see MAU declines in the U.S. (-9% y/y and -7% y/y, respectively), though 4Q marked X's first sequential increase in U.S. MAUs since 3Q24. On the international side, X MAUs continued to decline in 4Q (-5% y/y), albeit it a lower rate than 3Q (-8% y/y), while Reddit growth continues to slow (+6% y/y

in 4Q). Threads remains the fastest growing active user base across the group (+50% y/y globally), though growth continues to slow as the app scales. AI: In aggregate, adoption of AI continues to grow at a very high rate. ChatGPT and Gemini remain the two largest apps by active user count, growing >200% y/y and >150% y/y in 4Q, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, Perplexity was the fastest growth app for global users (>400% growth y/y in 4Q), while Meta AI recorded the highest growth on a sequential basis (>200% growth q/q).

Social: Engagement (total time spent on the app) trends in 4Q generally improved vs. 3Q on a global basis, though some pockets of weakness persisted. Facebook engagement growth improved in both the U.S. and abroad; in 4Q, Facebook engagement growth improved +1pt to reach +3% y/y in the U.S. and turned positive (+2% y/y) internationally after five quarters of consecutive year-over-year

declines. Growth improved similarly for Instagram, record 20+% growth in both the U.S. and abroad for the first time since 3Q23. Pinterest U.S. engagement growth improved to reach +28% y/y in 4Q, while ex-U.S. engagement growth remained steady at +12% y/y for the third quarter in a row. TikTok international engagement growth improved in 4Q (+11% y/y) vs. 3Q (+7% y/y), and U.S. engagement growth was positive (+6% y/y) for the first time since 3Q23. X engagement declines persist (-11% y/y both U.S. and ex-U.S.), and while 4Q marked an improvement vs. the ~20% declines seen in 3Q, growth on a 2Y stacked basis actually worsened sequentially. The notable pockets of weakness in 4Q were YouTube international (engagement growth flipped negative to reach -3% y/y declines) and Reddit U.S. (engagement growth worsened -4pts

to reach a -12% y/y decline), which reflects similar weakness to what we saw in 3Q, while Threads remains the high point of engagement growth globally (~100% y/y growth).

AI: Global engagement with AI reached another high in 4Q, growing close to +500% y/y (+15% q/q) in aggregate across these nine apps. ChatGPT remains the largest app in terms of total time spent on the app (globally >400% growth y/y, +7% q/q), recording roughly ~10x more engagement than the next closest app, Gemini (though the gap is notably narrowing vs. the ~21.5x engagement gap in 3Q25). DeepSeek recorded the 3 rd highest engagement globally (>500mn hours spent in 4Q), though ranked 6 th in the U.S.. In 4Q, Grok jumped Perplexity and Claude to reach the 4 th highest global engagement, and it remains the app with the 2 nd highest engagement within the U.S.. In-line with the user growth trend, Meta AI recorded the highest engagement growth on a sequential basis (~300% q/q). Sensor Tower data tables are on the following pages

We're positive on Criteo's Retail Media business, which began with the company's acquisition of HookLogic in 2016. 'The New Criteo' seems to have hit its stride after a business realignment and 2019/2020 management team refresh, and the company's Retail Media segment is now among the fastest-growing sub-segments within our entire coverage universe. We are also encouraged by the roughly 30% of Criteo's business that now goes through agencies (especially performance agencies), which is an important trend to watch as agencies had historically viewed Criteo as more of a competitor than a partner.

DV is a leader in the verification and fraud prevention market for digital advertising. The industry has largely become a two-horse race between DV and its main competitor, IAS. While we were hoping our checks would lead us to favor one of these platforms, that certainly was not the case, as most of the commentary we heard from our digital ad checks were largely positive. While there are some competing platforms in the industry that are viewed as somewhat less sophisticated after being acquired, there are some smaller competitors that received positive feedback on our calls which certainly need to be monitored. We believe the current environment supports both companies, as both companies offer 'must have' technology, while also layering in some newer 'nice to have' products at premium pricing.

Alphabet continues to drive growth at scale through strength in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, while investing in other key initiatives (cloud, hardware, AI) that should serve as multi-year growth levers. We view the competitive threat narrative as largely overdone, and expect Google's AI capabilities to maintain an engaged user base. Google's core business has high utility and durability as a dominant leader in search and ad-supported online video. We recommend GOOGL shares given supportive valuation on EPS and confidence in the company's long-term growth opportunity.

We're positive on (1) the Reels advertising opportunity in the near term as well as the Commerce possibilities over the long run, (2) we don't think you have to be a believer in the metaverse story to like the stock - we think the increased transparency around Facebook Reality Labs is a positive, but we also don't think the initial goal of reaching 1 billion metaverse users is a stretch (would only be 40% of gamers); and (3) feedback from our channel conversations remains mostly positive, with advertisers pointing to the company's unmatched scale and marketer tools relative to competitors (TikTok included).

Pinterest is a unique platform that continues to evolve as the company builds out new ad formats and objectives, looks to retain and entice new users through the platform as it focuses on creator tools, and as the digital advertising world continues to merge with e-commerce. We believe the company is poised to show accelerating revenue growth as our checks have become more positive, and through its Amazon partnership that brings incremental demand to the platform. We also think the company's native tech stack is improving for those who wish to go direct. Lastly, we believe there is still a large opportunity outside the U.S., with 40%-45% of users in a region in which Pinterest has yet to launch advertising.

Our Sell rating is predicated on the continued market share losses in the advertising business, as advertisers increasingly favor competitor platforms with scaled (such as Instagram) or growing audiences (such as TikTok). We believe recent pressure on core North America user growth, coupled with the fact that the company's primary monetizable products are underutilized by its existing user base, likely means a return to healthy top-line growth is not a near-term event.

We're positive on The Trade Desk due to (1) its reputation for being one of the most customer-friendly and intuitive alternatives to the industry's largest competitor from Google, DV360, (2) CTV is likely to accelerate as Netflix, Disney+ and others begin to offer AVOD tiers, and (3) we see continued share gains from competitor DSPs and as Google is likely to open its YouTube inventory to third parties in the coming quarters.

Meta Platform's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Meta builds products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and inhome devices. Meta also helps people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enables people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and videos as well as engage in other activities with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large. Meta helps its users stay connected everywhere by accessing its products, including: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and the company's Reality Labs' augmented and virtual reality products (Oculus and Portal). The company generates substantially all of its revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites.

Pinterest, Inc. is a digital advertising company where more than 450 million people around the world go to get inspiration for their lives. They come to discover ideas for just about anything you can imagine: daily activities like cooking dinner or deciding what to wear, major commitments like remodeling a house or training for a marathon, ongoing passions like fly fishing or fashion and milestone events like planning a wedding or a dream vacation. The company calls these people Pinners, and the company shows them visual recommendations, which they call Pins, based on their personal taste and interests. They then save and organize these recommendations into collections, called boards. Browsing and saving visual ideas on the service helps Pinners imagine what their future could look like, which helps them go from inspiration to action. Most consumer internet companies are either tools (search, ecommerce) or media (newsfeeds, video, social networks), whereas Pinterest views itself as not a pure media channel; it is a media-rich utility.

Snap's flagship product, Snapchat, is a camera application for mobile phones that enables people to communicate through short, ephemeral videos and images, called 'Snaps.' Snapchat users can directly send and receive messages, as well as post Snaps to 'Stories,' which are viewable by users' contacts for 24 hours. Snapchat users can also view publisher content on the app's Discover page. Snap's advertising products include Sponsored Creative Tools (such as custom augmented reality Lenses and Geofilters) and Snap Ads, which are full screen video advertisements. Snap also makes Spectacles, camera-equipped sunglasses that can capture Snaps at the push of a button. The company's strategy is to invest in innovation and create engaging products with which consumers can express themselves. The company was founded in 2011 by Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy and is headquartered in Venice, CA.

The company commercially launched its platform in 2011, targeting the display advertising channel, and has since added additional advertising channels.

Target Price Methodology : Our target price of $42 is based on 4.4x our NTM adjusted EBITDA estimate of $413mn. Risks: The evolving regulatory and privacy landscape could negatively impact the use of first-party data, and some unique identifiers being utilized in the industry to work around cookie-deprecation. There has been and continues to be considerable competition in the DSP and SSP landscape. Some competitors, particularly on the demand-side, tout independence and a singular focus on representing buyers as an unbiased and competitive advantage. There is continued risk from policy and procedural changes to the broader digital advertising industry that could negatively impact Criteo - Google's dominance as a provider of open web advertising technology and infrastructure gives the company significant influence on the greater industry (cookie deprecation, for example). Risk from competing digital advertising platforms gaining share, particularly the walled gardens and social media platforms.

Target Price Methodology: Our $15 target price is based on 8x our NTM adjusted EBITDA estimate of $274mn. Risks: Competition from its main competitor, IAS, as well as smaller providers from Oracle (MOAT, Grapeshot) and newer entrants that are focused on channel-specific solutions (Zefr, Channel Factor and others). Risk that Google's decision to no longer fully deprecate thirdparty cookies could lead to contextual targeting becoming less of a focus for advertisers. Headline and tangible risk from inability to combat newer fraud threats and methodologies.

Target Price Methodology : Our target price of $346 is based on a multiple of 32x our NTM GAAP EPS estimate of $10.81. Risks: In addition to general market and macroeconomic risks, for Google, the risks include: competition for digital and offline advertising dollars, shifts in volume of LLM use, shifts in advertising trends, potential for unfavorable anti-trust settlements and rulings, loss of search distribution, shifts in consumer behavior, and the risk that large-scale technology investments scattered across numerous areas will not pay off. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Target Price Methodology : Our $785 target price is based on 28x our NTM GAAP EPS estimate of $27.96. Risks: Risk from continued and increased regulatory headwinds and antitrust commentary; increased competition for time spent, particularly among younger Gen Z users; continued privacy headwinds from industry-led initiatives; and the company's potential inability to capture incremental revenue from newer ad formats/e-commerce.

Target Price Methodology: Our target price of $40 is based on 16.5x our NTM adjusted EBITDA estimate of $1.48bn. Risks: Downside risks are (1) not all advertisers believe their brand makes sense for Pinterest, (2) Pinterest still lacks the scale of Instagram and Facebook, as well as YouTube and could impact the company's ability to skew higher on budgets, (3) potential for a macro slowdown, if inflation starts to impact the consumer more than it has to date.

Target Price Methodology : Our $7 target price is based on 1.9x our NTM sales est. of $6.70bn. Risks: Upside risks include better macro environment, positive shift in advertiser perception, greater than expected levels of Snapchat+ adoption, upcoming AVOD launches could provide upside. Trade Desk, Inc. (The) (TTD) Target Price Methodology : Our target price of $74 is based on 25x our NTM adjusted EBITDA estimate of $1.39bn. Risks: Downside risk stems from newer AVOD offerings opting to not offer third-party demand over the long term, our market share assumptions for Netflix with ads, and macroeconomic factors that impact the greater advertising market, such as another wave of uncertainty from COVID and others.
