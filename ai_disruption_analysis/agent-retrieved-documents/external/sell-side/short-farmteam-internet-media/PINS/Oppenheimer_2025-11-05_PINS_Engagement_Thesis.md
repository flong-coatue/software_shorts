Tariffs Driving Incremental Weakness, Maintain Outperform as Engagement & Shopping Ads Catalysts Remain

Lowering target to $35 (was $44), but maintaining Outperform as company executing on shopping/AI strategy, despite UCAN weakness. Tariffs driving advertiser weakness in big box retail, Asia and furniture impacting 3Q/4Q UCAN advertiser demand. Positively, Performance+, PINS AI ad suite, is now 15% of total revenue after 4Q24 launch. Ad impressions +54% y/y vs. 2Q's +35%. 3Q UCAN ARPU +5% y/y vs. 2Q's +6 on a 3 point easier comp, 2% below Opco/Street. This was partially offset by international, with Europe/ROW ARPU 6%/10% above Street. 4Q ex-FX guidance 2 points below Street; however, EBITDA in line on 31bps better margins. Mgmt. expects double-digit UCAN revenue growth for foreseeable future. Target assumes 15x FY26E EBITDA, 29% discount to peers, 51%/33% discounts to RDDT/SNAP.

■ 3Q revenue +16% y/y ex-FX vs. 2Q +17%, 1% above Opco, in line with Street. MAU +12% y/y vs. 2Q +11%, 2% above Opco/Street. NA MAU +4% y/y vs. 2Q +4%; Europe +8% vs. +7%; ROW +16% vs. +14%. ARPU 1%/2% below Opco/ Street, UCAN weakness partially offset by international. NA ARPU +5% y/y vs. 2Q +6%; Europe +31% vs. +26%; ROW +50% vs. +46%. ■ Gross profit +18% y/y vs. 2Q +19%, in line with Opco/Street. Cost of revenue in line with Opco. R&D/G&A 1%/19% below Opco while S&M 2% above. EBITDA +24% y/y vs. 2Q +33%, 5%/4% above Opco/Street on 118bps/100bps higher margins.

■ Guiding 4Q revenue 2% below Street ex-FX, +14% y/y vs. 3Q +16%. New furniture tariffs cited as incremental impact vs. 3Q, with continued weakness in big box retail & Asia sellers. Guiding 4Q EBITDA in line with Street on 2bps/31bps better margins. ■ Business update. 85% of users using app (no compare). Impressions +54% y/y vs. 2Q's +35% with pricing -24% y/y vs. 2Q's -11%. Search queries continue growth with visual search fastest at +44% y/y (no compare). Outbound clicks to advertisers +40% y/y (no compare). UCAN catalyst: more retailer catalog on platform; growing SMB count; advanced attribution/LTV bidding in '26. Repurchased $198M shares vs. 2Q $53M.3

■ Estimate revisions. Increasing FY25/FY26E MAU 2%, with ARPU down 2%, leading to revenue unchanged/1% lower. Increasing FY25E EBITDA 1%, but decreasing FY26E 1% on lower revenue. Oppenheimer & Co.

■ Revenue '24-'27E CAGR of +14%. ■ Gross profit '24-'27E CAGR of +15%. ■ EBITDA '24-'27E CAGR of +20%.

■ Faster than expected ramp of 3P integrations driving upside to financial results. ■ Higher than expected user growth, particularly in UCAN.

Our $36 price target (was $44) assumes 15x estimated FY26 EBITDA, 29% discount to peers (SNAP, RDDT, ROKU, META, GOOG).

Competition from larger social media platforms for user engagement; competition for advertising spending; any delay or challenges relating to properly integrating 3P advertising partners; and ad market slowdown and inability to scale operating costs.

Pinterest operates a digital advertising platform focused on visual discovery, where users find inspiration for various areas, including home décor, fashion, health & food/drink.

Pinterest is a discovery platform lending itself well to direct response advertising with a "right to win" within its endemic categories. We believe investments in engagement and monetization will drive upside to long-term investor estimates. Pinterest boasts >500M monthly active users.

■ Continued improvements in engagement per user. ■ Better monetization via third-party (3P) integrations & improvements to auction pricing, particularly in UCAN.

■ Broader digital advertising macro slowdown. ■ Benefits from 3P integrations do not materialize as expected.
