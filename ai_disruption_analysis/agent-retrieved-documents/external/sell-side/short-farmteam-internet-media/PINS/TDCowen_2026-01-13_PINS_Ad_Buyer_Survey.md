Key '26 Ad Buyer Survey conclusions: (i) We forecast PINS share of WW Digital adv. remains stable from '25-'31; (ii) Ad buyers are increasingly using PINS Performance+ tools; (iii) PINS ROI is ahead of several Social comps (SNAP, Reddit, X); and (iv) Adoption of GenAI tools dovetails with PINS broader AI efforts. We rolled our model to 2031, maintain Buy and $44 Price Target. Ad Buyers Expect Stable Share of Ad Budgets '25-'27: Our 49 surveyed ad buyers expect that Pinterest's share of their Digital ad budgets will remain roughly stable from '25-'27 at ~2%. Long term, we forecast PINS share of global Digital advertising will remain steady at 0.7% from '25 to '30 (as a % of overall WW Digital ad spend x-China), comprising ad revenue growth of 13% over the period, above our expected WW Digital ad CAGR (x-China) of 11%.

PINS Cited as Highest ROI Platform Among Smaller Social Players (SNAP, Reddit, X): When asking respondents to gauge their target return on investment for each respective Digital platform, PINS garnered an average 2.8x ROI, roughly in line with 2.9 in last year's survey and landing ahead of SNAP, Reddit, and X, but below other major Social platforms. PINS also beat out smaller ad platforms when we asked which ad platform could emerge as a meaningful part of their Digital Ad spend in '26, 6% of respondents selected Pinterest, up from 4% in last year's survey. On a spend-weighted basis, 13% selected Pinterest. While Pinterest garnered a small portion of votes, it was the most selected platform behind Amazon on a spend weighted basis, and the only platform to get significant share among other, smaller ad platforms (SNAP, X, Reddit).

Survey Suggests Increasing Uptake of Pinterest's Performance+ Tools: We also asked ad buyers whether they have advertised using Pinterest's Performance+ advertising solution, which uses automation and AI tools to streamline campaign creation, bidding, targeting, and creative optimization. On an overall average basis, 56% of surveyed ad buyers have already used Performance+, up from 42% who said the same in last year's survey. We'd note that by the end of '24, Pinterest's Performance+ tools were narrowly centered around their creative suite. Since then, PINS has launched their ROAS bidding tool alongside other features focused towards targeting and budgeting. Per our recent conversations with an agency expert at Tinuiti, some advertisers have fully shifted their Pinterest spend to Performance+ throughout '25. We unveiled our 2031 estimates and rolled our DCF to 2031. Our DCF-based PT remains at $44.

More than Half of Surveyed Ad Buyers Place Ads on Pinterest: According to our survey, 51% of ad buyers in our survey said that their largest client advertises on Pinterest on a spendweighted basis, up from 42% who said the same last year. On an overall average basis, a smaller 33% of ad buyers noted that their largest client advertises on Pinterest, down slightly from 35% that said the same last year. The spend-weighted basis results suggest higher utilization levels among the largest advertisers in our survey. We asked ad buyers about their Pinterest budget across various ad units; Promoted Pins were the most popular ad unit (36% of respondents on a spend weighted basis), followed by Video Ads (19% of respondents), Shopping Ads (14% of respondents), Carousel Ads (11% of respondents), Quiz Ads (10%), Collections Ads (4%), and Idea Ads (4%). We'd note that depending on preference, an advertiser may automate their ability to choose between different ad formats on Pinterest.

Pinterest is a social media platform focused on visual search and discovery where users explore their interests, seek inspiration, and browse items they may want to purchase. The platform had 553MM MAUs at the end of FY24, up from 265MM at the end of FY18; meanwhile, the company has grown revenue at a 30% CAGR from FY18 to FY24 and gone from a $39MM EBITDA loss to positive $1BN in '24. Going forward, we expect Pinterest to be a share gainer in the global digital ad market as we forecast rev to grow from $4.2BN in '25E to $7.9BN in '30E, while we forecast EBITDA margins to expand from 20.1% in '25E to 37.3% in '30E, resulting in an ~18% EBITDA CAGR '25-'30E.

We forecast 13% annual revenue growth in '25-'30E, driven by a combination of midsingle-digit user and ARPU growth over the next 5 years. We forecast EBITDA rising from $1.3BN in FY25 to $2.9BN in FY30E as margins expand modestly.

Our estimates may be conservative if Pinterest is able to grow users and or ARPU faster than our current mid-single-digit projections. Additionally, if the overall digital advertising market grows faster than we anticipate it could result in better than expected revenue for PINS.

Pinterest is a visual search and discovery platform in which users explore their interests, seek inspiration, and browse items they may want to purchase. PINS was founded in 2010 by Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp, and Paul Sciarra, and the company completed its initial public offering in 2018. Since then, Pinterest has emerged as meaningful player within the digital advertising landscape, and has scaled to 600 million global users. Women make up ~2/3 of the user base, while Gen Z users are >40% of users and the fastest growing user cohort. The company is making its content more shoppable while also driving both engagement & ad load. In addition, Pinterest tends to be a positive, brand-safe destination for advertisers given the platform's focus on ideas, inspiration, and project planning.

(i) Further rollout of Performance+ ad features, (ii) 4Q25 earnings results, (iii) announcements around new 3rd party partnerships, and (iv) the launch of new product features that resonate with users driving engagement.

If Pinterest is not able to drive meaningful user and ARPU growth through product innovation and effective marketing, then our estimates may prove to be too bullish. Also, should the company be unable to drive continued efficiency gains across it's cost line items profitability may fall short of our expectations.

January 13, 2026 Digital Ad Check Suggest Solid 4Q25 Pinterest Trends: We spoke with an ad expert from a Digital agency that runs $4BN+ / yr in managed ad spend. Our expert's same store ad spend on Pinterest grew 37% y/y in 4Q25, down vs +63% y/y in 3Q25 but remaining solid as impressions grew 24% y/y (vs +52% y/y in 3Q25) and pricing grew 11% y/y (vs +7% y/y in 3Q25). Our expert noted continued strong uptake of PINS' Performance+ campaign types. Recall that on our 3Q25 call, our expert noted that some advertisers have fully shifted their Pinterest spend to Performance+. Performance+ originally launched in late '24 with automated creative tools, but has since expanded to include automated bidding tools and other AI driven automated features.

4Q25 Forecast: For 4Q25, we estimate reported revenue of $1.32BN, +14.7% y/y (vs +16.8% y/y in 3Q25), 0.4% below cons est. and right near the midpoint of mgmt's guide of $1.313BN-$1.338BN, +14% to +16% y/y, including 1% of FX tailwind. Recall that PINS mgmt. on the 3Q25 call noted a number of new initiatives which we expect will support 4Q and longer term growth: i) beta launch of Top of Search ads, ii) launch of local inventory ads, and iii) where-to-buy links. Mgmt. also cited accelerating strength across international geo's as PINS drives lower funnel ad units in the Retail vertical. We estimate 4Q MAUs of 614MM, +11% y/y, and ARPU +1.7% y/y, vs. +2.9% y/ y in 3Q25, driven by ARPU gains across regions.

We project 4Q25 adj. EBITDA of $542.3MM, +15.2% y/y and in line with consensus EBITDA and vs. mgmt guide of $533MM to $558MM, and vs mgmt's reiterated commentary for y/y margin expansion in 2H25 (mgmt. expects more modest y/y expansion vs 1H25 given investments in revenue driving initiatives). We expect GAAP EPS of $0.51 vs. cons. $0.43. FY26 Financial & User Estimates: We estimate '26 revenue of $4.86BN, +15.1% y/y, 0.7% above consensus and vs. estimated 15.6% y/y growth in '25. We expect MAUs of 665MM, +8.3% y/y and ARPU +6.7% y/y, vs our estimate of +4.5% y/y in '25. We project '26 adjusted EBITDA of $1.5BN, in line with consensus, and we forecast GAAP EPS of $0.84 vs consensus est. $0.76.

Longer-term, we expect the business to be driven by (i) Growing users and higher engagement over time, including in int'l markets; (ii) Higher ARPU as a result of monetization efforts, including lower funnel initiatives; and (iii) Third party partnerships and resellers.

To understand current sentiment and future Ad market trends, we conducted a survey of 49 senior US advertising buyers in December 2025 who advertise across Digital and traditional advertising mediums. The survey was conducted December 3 -December 9, 2025 and is a follow-up to the Ad buyer surveys we conducted in December 2024 (LINK) December 2023 (LINK), December 2022 (LINK), December 2021 (LINK), December 2020 (LINK), December 2019 (LINK), December 2018 (LINK), June 2018 (LINK), December 2017 (LINK), December 2016 (LINK), December 2015 (LINK) , December 2014 (LINK), December 2013 (LINK), and September 2012 (LINK).

We asked respondents about their allocation of total Digital ad spend by platform for '25 through '27. The biggest share gainers were Amazon, for which ad buyers expect budgets will increase from 9% in '25 to 10% in '27 on a spendweighted basis, and TikTok (5% in '25 to 6% in '27). Ad buyers expect PINS share of their Digital ad budgets to remain roughly stable from '25-'27 at ~2%. How Do You Plan to Allocate Your Digital Spend by Platform in '25, '26, '27? (%) Spend Wtd Source: TD Cowen Proprietary Ad Buyer Survey, December 2025 (n=49).

Over the long term, we forecast PINS share of global Digital advertising to remain steady over time at 0.7% from '25 to '30, comprising ad revenue growth of 13% over the period, above our expected WW Digital ad CAGR (x-China) of 11% over the period.

According to our survey, 51% of ad buyers said that their largest client advertises on Pinterest on a spend-weighted basis, up from 42% who said the same last year. On an overall average basis, a smaller 33% of ad buyers noted that their largest client advertises on Pinterest, down slightly from 35% who said the same last year. The spend-weighted basis results suggest higher utilization levels among the largest advertisers in our survey.

When asked which ad platform could emerge as a meaningful part of their Digital Ad spend in '26, 6% of respondents selected Pinterest, up from 4% in last year's survey. On a spend-weighted basis, 13% selected Pinterest. While Pinterest garnered a small portion of votes, we'd note that it was the most selected platform behind Amazon on a spend-weighted basis and the only platform to get significant share among other, smaller ad platforms (SNAP, X, Reddit).

Source: TD Cowen Proprietary Ad Buyer Survey, Dec. 2025 (n=49). We asked ad buyers about their Pinterest budget across various ad units. Among survey respondents, Promoted Pins were the most popular ad unit (36% of respondents on a spend-weighted basis), followed by Video Ads (19% of respondents), Shopping Ads (14% of respondents), Carousel Ads (11% of respondents), Quiz Ads (10%), Collections Ads (4%), and Idea Ads (4%). Of note, Promoted Pins were also the most popular choice on an overall average basis (30% of respondents). We'd note that, depending on preference, an advertiser may automate their ability to choose between different ad formats on Pinterest.

January 13, 2026 We also asked ad buyers whether they have advertised using Pinterest's Performance+ advertising solution, which uses automation and AI tools to streamline campaign creation, bidding, targeting, and creative optimization. On an overall average basis, 56% of surveyed ad buyers have already used Performance+, up from 42% who said the same in last year's survey. We'd note that by the end of '24, Pinterest's Performance+ tools were narrowly centered around their creative suite. Since then, PINS has launched their ROAS bidding tool alongside other features focused towards targeting and budgeting. Per our recent conversations with an agency expert at Tinuiti, some advertisers have fully shifted their Pinterest spend to Performance+ throughout '25.

NYSE: PINS ESG Score: 56/100 ESG Industry Percentile: 41 st

Establishing materiality is critical to evaluating a company's ESG performance. Factors most material in one sector (or to a particular company) may not be as important to another. In addition, the factors that are material - and the degree to which factors are material - can change over time. Applying data to frameworks established by SASB (the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and by FactSet, we present in the chart above the three most material ESG factors that investors should focus on for the company that is the subject of this report; the Dynamic Materiality™ of each factor (i.e., what percentage of overall materiality the category represents for the subject company); and a Score for the subject company in each of these three categories (on a 0 to 100 basis, with 50 being average). We also calculate an overall ESG Score for the subject company, which is presented above (in green) and on the cover of this report. A full explanation of how this ESG Score is derived is presented below.

200,000+ SOURCES 4,500,000+ DATA POINTS 300,000 SIGNALS SCREENED BY ESG FRAMEWORK processed per month generated monthly TD Cowen leverages technology from FactSet to generate our ESG scores. Truvalue uses artificial intelligence to capture the stakeholder view of how companies are performing on ESG metrics, using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) materiality framework (www.sasb.org). These data are leveraged to calculate a score for each company, which allows TD Cowen to have a common framework and uniform way to approach ESG discussions with our clients. TD Cowen ESG scores appear on Company and Company Quick Take notes and are updated daily.

The process begins with capturing unstructured data from more than 200,000 sources, in 38 languages. These data are culled from a wide range of sources with varied perspectives, including industry publications, news outlets, NGOs, trade unions, government sources, legal and regulatory filings, and academic publications. Natural language processing is used to interpret semantic content from the original sources and generate analytics by applying criteria consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks. Performance is scored on a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate more positive ESG performance, and scores below reflect more negative ESG performance. A score of NA means not enough data is available on the company to generate a score.

| Top 3 Material ESG Categories   | Dynamic Materiality TM   |   Score |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Selling Practices               | 19%                      |      47 |
| Customer Welfare                | 15%                      |      64 |
| Customer Privacy                | 13%                      |      56 |

Our valuation methodology is primarily based on Discounted Cash Flow analysis, comparable company multiples such as EV/FCF, EV/EBITDA, and P/E, and sum-of-the-parts analysis (for companies with ownership stakes in other equities or significant assets such as patents/IP). However, this varies by company; for instance, we will often use EV/Revenue for high-growth companies that have recently entered the public equity markets. We make investment recommendations on certain early stage, pre-revenue companies based upon an assessment of their business model, technology, probability of market success, and the potential market opportunity, balanced by an assessment of applicable risks. Such companies may not be assigned a price target.

The industry in which our companies operate is fiercely competitive and technological change is rapid. All of our companies face the risk that they are unable to keep pace with new innovations or that new innovations impact competitive positioning. Additionally, our companies are international operators and are therefore exposed to currency fluctuations and other factors associated with operating in a foreign territory. Finally, our names sit within the advertising industry more broadly and are exposed to the same seasonality and macro trends as the rest of the group, including competition from TV and other offline channels.

The biggest downside risk to our estimates relates to user growth and monetization trends. If the Pinterest userbase grows slower than our forecast, or if monetization growth lags, there could be downside risk to our revenue expectations and to our price target. Another potential risk would be if the rise of online shopping on competing platforms (in particular via emerging short-form video) leads to less than expected growth of online shopping through the Pinterest platform. The key upside risk to our estimate is if Pinterest is able to grow advertiser monetization faster than we anticipate, or grow users / engagement faster than we forecast, this could lead to upside vs. our price target.
