Ad Agency Themes -Large Agencies Competing More Effectively of Late, Pricing Pressure & In-housing Likely Continuing, & Cost Cutting Efforts Expanding to Combat Margin Headwinds (Cleveland Research) Important disclosures can be found in Appendix Note: Under no circumstances is this to be distributed or forwarded in any manner to anyone outside of your organization . The feedback below is a summary of feedback on trends impacting advertising agencies & the impact of AI. We do not cover any of the public ad agencies and we do not have an investment opinion.

1. Large agencies seem to be more effectively competing with Indie agencies of late . We are hearing more instances of global agencies better defending & winning business -a change vs. the last few years of indies typically outperforming & gaining share. Our research suggests larger holding co.'s have been well positioned due to a growing trend of clients wanting to consolidate marketing functions (creative, media, PR, retail media, etc) under one agency to better leverage costs -with holding co. breadth of services typically better vs. point solutions for Indie agencies.

2. Competition increasing for new business as agencies move up/down market -in-housing also picking up. We have seen a growing trend of large/global agencies putting bidding on mid-market accounts, while also hearing examples of smaller agencies getting more serious consideration for bigger global accounts. AI looks to be introducing efficiencies that have allowed agencies of all sizes to serve a broader client set & agencies report a need to find new business to offset fee pressure with existing accounts. We have also heard more brands taking functions in-house lately as AI allows internal teams to do the work & as agency layoffs have made it easier to find quality talent.

3. OMC/IPG merger expected to create additional fee pressures -combined entity likely seeing better-than-expected retention . Agencies fear the potential OMC/IPG merger could spark additional fee pressure over the near-term as the new entity is expected to be more aggressive with rates to win RFPs. Feedback was mixed on the strength of the Axciom data offering relative to Publicis Epsilon (viewed as best in market). We have seen very little attrition for OMC/IPG since news of the merger, which partners had previously viewed as a possibility.

4. Pricing pressures continue as existing customers turn more aggressive in asks for rate cuts during renewals. We continue to hear similar rates of Y/Y fee pressure today vs. our update ~90 days ago as agencies report 1-2pts of fee reductions in RFPs. Existing accounts also look to be seeing rate pressures, as clients ask for lower rates, even for long-tenured customers where service/performance has been good. Headwinds in Social/Search look to be broadening into Retail Media, driven by new areas of fee compression driven by automation of AMZN ad campaigns.

5. Principal-based volumes moving higher as large agencies try to help offset rate pressure . Our work suggests agencies are increasing headcount & overall investment towards principle-based trading desks. Clients have seemed largely willing to accept the trade-offs of less transparency for lower costs. Agencies with the highest levels of principle-trading penetration called out challenges with continuing to use this as a lever to offset fee pressure since principal trading is unable to resell inventory like sports, search, and most social platforms. - 6. Headcount reductions expected to continue in 2026 as agencies aim to offset margin pressure . Large holding co.'s sound most proactive in cutting roles in order to offset pricing pressure along with some degree of strategic deployment of AI, helping streamline ops. Indie agencies seem to be less aggressive in cutting costs, with margins taking more of a direct hit. We have not yet seen creative team headcount move lower -though this is an area to watch, given an uptick in Gen-AI creative adoption for enterprise clients & a bigger adoption jump for SMBs.
