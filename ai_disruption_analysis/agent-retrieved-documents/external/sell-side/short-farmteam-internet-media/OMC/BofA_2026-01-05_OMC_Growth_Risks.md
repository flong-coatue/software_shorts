Price objective basis & risk Omnicom (OMC) Our price objective of $77 is based on the average of a discounted cash flow (weighted-average cost of capital 9.7%, long-term growth 0.5%) and 8x 2026E P/E, a 50% discount to the equal-weighted S&P500 multiple, reflecting greater uncertainty post the IPG acquisition announcement. Upside risks to our price objective are if i) the global synchronized recovery leads to a relief on marketing spending, ii) Omnicom actively repositions its assets, simplifying its structure, dismantling silos, or selling non-performing units, iii) the secular wave of consolidation come back, either between agencies or between consultancies and agencies. Downside risks to our price objective are if Omnicom loses a big account and/or a large account decreases its media spend, macro decelerates abruptly and consultancies have a bigger and earlier impact than expected.

Omnicom Downgrade to Underperform, PO cut to $7 7 The near- term merits of the IPG transaction seem clear to us : low price paid, upside potential on synergies and higher share repurchases. However, we think the market is underestimating : 1) downside risks on organic growth , 2) EPS dilution from disposals , and 3) necessity to reinvest behind the legacy IPG assets. As such, we downgrade to Underperform from Neutral , cut ting our 2026-28 E EPS 7-12%, well below consensus , and slightly adjust the components in our DCF/ multiple (averaged) valuation : as a result our PO declines to $77 from $87 - see page 5 for details. Three key merits of the IPG acquisition The final purchase price of 6x LTM EV/EBITDA is markedly below the average of recent transactions in the space . The headcount reduction announced so far points to upside risks on synergies which in turn should provide additional firepower for share repurchases to be considered , against low valuation , in our view

. Risk #1 : Downside risks on organic growth E xpectations for new Omnicom to deliver 3%+ organic sales growth in 2026-27 are misplaced in our view given: 1) Omnicom had a sub-par year 2025 in terms of new business . 2) A ccount reviews may step up in 2026 given higher than unusual employee turnover . 3) C reative agencies f ace accelerated revenue attrition risks in 2026 as AI likely catalyses a change in remuneration models. Omnicom has 25%+ of revenue tied to this practice and its own internal restructuring risk exacerbates the trend. Risk #2: Bigger portfolio pruning We estimate that up to ~15% of pro forma revenue may be the focus of dispositions. However, given the absence of natural buyers for these assets and OMC ' s past track record, these activities may be discontinued or terminated with limited proceeds. Risk #3 Legacy IPG assets need reinvestments Despite flat to declining organic growth, IPG ' s margin expanded by 160bp in 2022-25 (+400bp since 2019) against peers fla

In turn, this reflects our cautious structural view while we expect internal restructuring will also dent growth during the forecasted period . Bigger impact from disposals : We had already modelled some, but our new analysis suggests these could be larger than we had anticipated . Reduced profitability

: We are bullish on the delivery of synergies as we model $1bn to 2028, we now consider that legacy IPG assets in particular will require reinvestments to stimulate top-line after several years of underinvestment ($500m baked into forecasts). Slightly higher net interests costs : upon the release of proforma financial information covering 2024 and 9M25 . This is partly offset by 1) lower non-controlling interests, in line of 9M25 developments 2) Lower share count from 2027 as we upsize our share repurchase assumptions . We have kept our price objective (PO) methodology unchanged (50/50 DCF and target multiple). However, our WACC increases 20bp to 9.7% , reflecting a higher beta given greater forecasting uncertainty. Our terminal growth rate decrease s to 0.5% from 1.5% as we expect the enlarged Omnicom to grow at a lower rate than previously. As a result of lower earnings and these different inputs

, our DCF output falls to $81. Applying an unchanged 8x P/E multiple to our 2026 forecasts implies a fair value of $73. Consequently, our PO is reduced to $77. Arguably, using 8x target valuation may seem extreme considering expectations for high-single digit EPS growth and discount relative to either Publicis or the broader consulting and ad tech space. However, we think the discount is justified by our expectations that Omnicom ' s organic growth will lag versus Publicis (0-1% versus 5%+) and we see this metric as the key determinant of the P/E multiple .

value creation on day 1 Financially, the acquisition of IPG by Omnicom comes with three main positives, which suggest to us the deal should be EPS accretive from day 1 : 1) Low purchase price paid , 2) Bigger than expected cost synergies , 3) Potentially more share repurchases. We would expect t hese merits to be discussed at Omnicom investor day (date TBA). Omnicom is acquiring IPG on highly favourable terms Omnicom (OMC) announced the acquisition of Interpublic (IPG) on 9 th December 2024 in an all stock transaction. On that day, based on announced terms of 1 IPG = 0.344 OMC shares and Omnicom ' s undisturbed share price of $103.4, the acquisition valued IPG at ~$35.6 per share, a premium of 2 2 % versus the undisturbed share price of $29.3. Implied market capitalisation came in at ~$13.4bn and an enterprise value of ~$14.6bn.

Based on 2024 EBITDA of $1.7bn and non-GAAP EPS of $2.77, this equated to transaction multiples of 8.7x LTM EV/EBITDA and 13x LTM P/E pre-synergies for IPG ' s assets. This was already in itself below transaction multiples observed in the space over the past 15 years.

That day, Omnicom share s closed at $71.5 , implying a final takeout price of $24.6, 16% below IPG ' s undisturbed share price and implied enterprise value of $10.3bn.

Despite IPG reporting declining revenue in 9M25 (-7% Y/Y of which -3.3% organic sales growth), deep cost-cutting efforts and restructuring measures have lifted adjusted EBITDA by 3% Y/Y in 9M25, while non-GAAP EPS grew 8% Y/Y. This implies Omnicom eventually acquired IPG ' s assets for 6x LTM EV/EBITDA and 8. 4 x LTM P/E . Synergy estimates looking increasingly conservative We assume in our proforma model th at $1bn of gross cost synergies get delivered by 2028. Omnicom closed the acquisition of Interpublic (IPG) in late November, and unveiled a new organisation on December 1. As part of the announcement, Omnicom also unveiled targeted headcount reduction. Per CEO John Wren, the pro forma structure will have 105,000 employees, compared to combined figure of 128,200 at YE24, i.e a reduction of ~23,200. This breaks down as follows: ~3,200 positions already eliminated by IPG prior to

the merger, as per its most recent 10-Q filing ~2,300 positions eliminated by Omnicom prior to the merger. Omnicom itself has not outlined that number but it can be deducted from the " salary & service costs " line which were down 2.5% Y/Y in 9M25. ~10,000+ from withdrawing many smaller agencies through sales and disposals, in some cases keeping a minority stake. ~4,000 redundancies to be completed before the end of 2025. The balance (~3,700) corresponds to potential additional redundancies to be announced in 2026 either through synergies or further asset disposals. Exhibit 11 : Omnicom targets significant reduction in headcount by 2026 Combined headcount IPG/Omnicom Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 12 : Around 4,000 positions have been eliminated in December 2025 Headcount reduction split from 2024 to 2026 Source: BofA Global Research estimates BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Omnicom '

s salary & service costs per employee amounted to ~$100,000 in 2025 and ~$110,000 at IPG. Eliminating ~4.000 positions on December 1, 2025 should thus have approximately ~$400m gross cost savings for 2026. We estimate t his may increase to up to ~$800m if we consider that an additional ~3,700 jobs may be eliminated through further synergies in 2026. Regardless of the final headcount figure, this points to upside versus the initial synergy figure communicated in December 2024. Back then, Omnicom guided on ~$750m synergies to be delivered, with the majority in the first two years post closing. Out of the $750m, the different buckets are: Removing redundant functions and back-office operations through unified practice area leadership teams = $130m Cutting 40% of corporate expenses, combining and streamlining senior leadership and operations = compensation savings of $200m Eliminate duplicative general and administrative costs = $110m Administrative costs savings from merging two listed companies = $25m

Unified procurement organisation to maximise benefits from third-party vendors and reduce duplicative third-party research and data = $150m Integrating IT and shared-services = $70m Real estate savings = $65m While the above breakdown does not specifically single out staff cost or headcount reduction, we think these are primarily found in the first four buckets which total $465m. Shareholder returns to increase , low leverage Omnicom ' s board already approve a $0.10 increase in quarterly dividends from $0.70 to $0.80. While good news, in our view it is largely reflect ive of : A catch-up on the existing payout ratio: despite Omnicom ' s non-GAAP EPS growing at 7% CAGR since 2021, DPS had been kept flat. Omnicom being a much larger company, as pro forma adjusted net earnings are 65-70% larger than Omnicom ' s stand-alone .

BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 14 : We expect a step up in share repurchases Annual share repurchases Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Under its new dividend policy and based on a pro forma share count of ~320m shares , we estimate shareholders will receive $ 1bn in dividends in 2026 , roughly similar to the combined entities in 2025 . We see scope for this to be complimented by proactive share repurchases given: Both Omnicom and Interpublic have a track-record of actively repurchasing shares ($500-600m per year for Omnicom, $300-350m of Interpublic) outside of large scale M&A. Pro forma leverage of just 0.5x Net Debt / EBITDA out of the gate . As at 30 th

September 2025, which is the last available date for the pro forma balance sheet, we calculate net financial debt amounted to $4.2bn, with gross cash of $4.9bn, corresponding to financial leverage of 1x Net Debt/EBITDA. However, due to favorable working capital patterns in 4Q, a gencies will generate disproportionate FCF in 4Q (sidenote: this is also why we usually look at agencies " average net debt " when valuing them), we expect Omnicom to sit on ~$7bn gross cash at YE25, with gross debt of ~$9. 1 bn, implying net debt of $2. 1 bn and 0.5x Net Debt / EBITDA out of the gate, and slightly down year on year. Low valuation , relative to peers and the broader market at ~9x 2025E P/E Omnicom has announced that CEO John Wren will forfeit his fixed remuneration and being fully paid in shares over the next three years Synergies providing additional firepower . Cost synergies are expected to

Since FCF generation in 2026 will be impacted by significant one-time cash costs linked to restructuring (Omnicom guided on $450m costs to achieve the planned synergies) , we project ~$1bn for that year and then stepping up to ~$1.5bn from 2027 as synergies ramp. A more unified and integrated structure As part of the 1 st December announcement, Omnicom unveiled a new leadership structure with 9 " Connected capabilities " leaders . On top, 3 executives will be in charge of implementing enterprise-wide solutions. We think the new set up suggests a departure from Omnicom ' s previous federated " best of breed " model. Hypothetically, this should allow Omnicom to be more competitive in pitches where clients are seeking a reduced number of partners. Anecdotally, just before Christmas, Omnicom was appointed as global creative and media partner for Spanish banking group BBVA.

Omnicom initially guided in early 2025 for organic sales growth to be 3.5-4.5%. Following 1Q25, it subsequently revised this guidance to 2.5-4.5%. While quantitatively marginal, this is the first time since Omnicom started provid ing annual guidance that it reduced the the level intra year. As at 9M25, it ha d

delivered 3.0% organic sales growth , on track, albeit at the lower end of its new guidance . Omnicom notably pointed to tough comparatives (~100bp) impact stemming from Paris Olympic Games and some work it did around the US Presidential election. While Omnicom had built a solid track-record of beating quarterly consensus expectations, the last few quarters have been just about in line to slightly below forecasts.

Exhibit 17 : Beats are harder to come by Omnicom organic sales growth - actual versus expected Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Organic growth is increasingly boosted by Omnicom ' s specific revenue accounting . Unlike peers, which present revenue and calculate organic sales growth net of billable expenses (also referred to as third-party costs) , Omnicom discloses revenue and organic growth on a gross basis. This accounting nuance is important. While it is difficult to exactly know how much of Omnicom ' s third-party costs are effectively fully passed through , on our maths, we calculate that Omnicom ' s organic growth on revenue minus billable expenses would be flat for 9M25 against +3% gross organic growth . Conversely, if we gross up WPP and Publicis for billable expenses, their organic growth would be respectively 200 bp and 400bp better than the headline reported net figure. Omnicom is the

agency Holdco which recognizes the highest figure of billable expenses amongst all peers as these represent 28% of gross revenue in 2025, compared to Publicis 16%, WPP 24% and IPG 14% for example. Billable expenses have generally gone up at all agencies, which is likely due to their growing foray into " principal media " buying operations - except for IPG given it has traditionally done very little in that space.

: We estimate that Omnicom's "net" organic growth (= revenue less third-party costs) turned negative in 3Q25 Omnicom organic sales growth Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH IPG also had a disappointing year . Compared to the initial projections that were laid out in the S-4 merger filing, we would expect IPG to miss 2025 revenue by about 2%. While IPG initially set a guidance for -1% to -2% organic sales growth for 2025 , performance stood at -3.3% for 9M25. If IPG were to miss its initial annual guidance again, it would be a third consecutive miss . Organic sales growth has been hit by three account losses which taken together had a ~500 bp negative impact: Amazon, Lego and Pfizer . However, underlying performance also likely deteriorated as IPG should have also theoretically benefitted from the disposal of underperforming units (e.g R/GA and Huge) that represent ~5% of revenue . H eadwinds in the Tech & Telecom sector also abated. These factors had

dragged down organic growth by 300bp in 2023 and we think another 150bp in 2024.

Biggest Media wins to date include Qatar Tourism Authority, Intersnack Group and Entain. On the losing side, legacy Omnicom agencies lost duties for the UK Government, Henkel, Dr Oetker, Aldi and Barilla. It is also worth noting

that compared to previous years, Omnicom has been unsuccessful in securing any of the large global assignments that came up during 2025, such as Kenvue, Mars, Reckitt, Coke or Paramount. This contrasts with 2024, where Omnicom triumphed in large reviews such as Amazon and Volkswagen , which it successfully retained .

Accenture IPG Source: Global Research, company report, Comvergence BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH However, IPG ' s performance ended on a disappointing note as it lost media duties with one of its largest client, Kenvue, in December 2025. Total Kenvue billings amount to $1.35bn in 2025 and we estimate IPG was defending $1bn+. Interestingly, Kenvue announced it would review its creative and media assignments on the day of IPG winning Bayer, which may signal that a potential client conflict arose. As part of that review, Omnicom also lost creative duties. On the creative side, the picture is also mixed: legacy Omnicom and IPG agencies won new assignments with BBVA, Porsche, American Express, Bayer, NatWest, LinkedIn, Keurig Dr Pepper and Kimberly-Clark. Yet, there have been also some noteworthy losses such as Kenvue, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Haleon and Bacardi. 2026 likely to see a step up in account reviews According to our tracker of new business, neither Omnicom nor IPG have fac ed

significant client reviews prior to the merger completion. However, we would expect 2026 to represent a litmus test as large scale mergers can lead clients to ensure that the heavy lifting behind the integration and ensuing layoffs do not result in talent attrition. Clients may be also be keen on re-negotiating price discounts in the context of higher synergy figures. On that note, we try and pay close attention to higher than usual senior staff turnover as potentially there is a risk this could trigger elevated client churn going forward.

Further to the recently announced outcome of Kenvue, another account may be worth watching: Kellanova , which spends $600m+ annually on advertising, and has just been acquired by Mars. Kellanova currently partners with a number

of creative and PR agencies which were once part of IPG in the North American market: FCB, MullenLowe, The Martin Agency and Weber Shandwick. Recall, FCB and MullenLowe are being folded into other Omnicom creative agencies post merger. Kellanova currently partners with Publicis in creative for Europe , which also manage its global media duties. As a reminder, Publicis won Mars media duties away from WPP during 2025.

estimate that 55% of the the new entity ' s revenue will be derived from " Media & Advertising " . Under that moniker, there are however two very distinct entities underneath: Media (Omnicom Media Group) and Advertising (Omnicom Advertising Group). Out of the ~$14bn in revenue generated by " Media & Advertising " in 2025 , we estimate that around ~$9bn will be made in Media (including ~$2.5-3bn of third-party costs) while Advertising around ~$5bn or 25% of the new group. As we discuss in the following section, w e are fundamentally bullish on the " Media " discipline within agencies. Generally, the fragmented nature of the media/tech landscape calls for deeper level of expertise and consulting. However, we have increased concerns around " advertising " (also referred to as " creative " ), particularly in the case of Omnicom given its significant exposure to this part of the business and expected disruption from the necessary internal restructuring measures which have been taken. Traditional ad dollars are declining, performance marketing on the rise . Creative input is more often used when advertisers '

need for " one size fits all " marketing campaigns, usually in linear TV, outdoor and print media. However, this represents a declining portion of advertisers ' budget , due to the declining audiences of traditional media ( " advertising follows the eyeballs " ). Conversely, marketing budgets are shifting to data-driven and measurable channels where creative is often templated or automated for scale, reducing the need for big budget production . Low barriers to entry According to Comvergence , the " Big 5 " (Publicis, Omnicom, WPP, Havas, Dentsu) media agencies control ~75% market share and we believe this figure may have expand ed . There is no similar data available for creative but we believe it may be meaningfully more fragmented . Agility and innovation are important success factors , while scale is less so . Tech costs associated with creative are also lower. Several high profile independent agencies exist on a regional /local level and can thrive alongside the bigger agency networks. For example, in France, Romance, a French independent creative agency crafted a highly popular marketing

campaign for retailer Intermarch é that generated 1bn+ views on social media . Creative work is also easier to insource. C lient relationship s are more volatile and transactional While " agency of record " is the dominant form of contractual relationship, clients tend to hire creative agencies on a campaign by campaign basis. Exhibit 29 : Creative is usually more project driven versus Media How agencies get hired by advertisers Source: BofA Global Research estimates, ANA BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 30 : A majority of advertisers are looking to change how they pay their agency partners % of respondents saying they expect remuneration models to change in the next 12 months Source: BofA Global Research estimates, ANA BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH AI set to catalyse change in agencies' remuneration models and could accelerate fee pressure and disintermediation . According to a Forrester survey, 96% of surveyed agencies (n = 400) are either using or exploring AI. While not always successful (McDonald ' s had to withdraw an AI-generated commercial in the Netherlands this winter) and lacking authenticity, examples of cheaper

AI-powered campaigns are proliferating. The issue coming with AI is that: it is triggering a change in remuneration models, which may not be advantageous to creative agencies. According to a recent survey carried out by the US Association of National Advertisers (n = 100) , only 16% of respondents said AI had a moderate impact on agency remuneration so far. However, 86% say they plan to revisit compensation models with creative agencies in the next 12 months. As technology drives efficiency, hours decrease, so agency hours/income should also decrease. Most of the tech costs associated with AI are absorbed by agencies: only 6% indicate they charge for those. " The rise of AI in agencies will bring about the first substantial change to agency remuneration since the introduction of service fees over media commissions in the 1980s " Jay Pattisall, Forrester " It ' s really hard to pivot a legacy business that was fully an FTE business into a SaaS company. I can ' t think of a harder pivot to make. " Rebecca Sykes, Partner and head of Brandtech ' s emerging technology business In some instances, we have observed that

advertisers lean on their existing creative agencies , there are also several other examples where the work is performed in-house or by specialised AI production and creative agencies outside of agency holding companies . L ' Oreal is now producing roughly 50,000 images and 500 videos per month using Google Cloud ' s Imagen 3 and Veo 2 technologies to scale creative across products and markets. Kraft Heinz used the same tools to cut down production on some assets from eight weeks to eight hours. Unilever said it now uses AI to create 400 creative assets per product for select brands in its beauty and wellbeing division. In September 2025. AI also further fuels the traditional " frenemy " debate between agencies and tech vendor s such as Google, Meta or Amazon. These are at the same time media owners, competitors and clients. For example, Google is a top customer of WPP, Omnicom ' s BBDO has created marketing campaigns for Meta ' s WhatsApp. Omnicom also won in 2025 OpenAI ' s first media contract. But these tech platforms can also find themselves competing against agencies when they roll out tools, such as Meta '

s Advantage+ Creative, which allow brands to automatically generate multiple ad variations by tweaking images (brightness, contrast), adding backgrounds, overlays, animation, music, and rewriting copy for optimized performance. To be clear, Meta CEO Zuckerberg publicly said these tools were aimed at SMEs, rather than the large brands agencies usually work with. Omnicom has material exposure to creative… One common issue when analysing the space is that agencies do not provide consistent revenue splits by discipline. Differences in revenue recognition (gross/net) can also lead to some revenue being over or understated. Some creative networks are diversified in nature to be multi-service. For example, WPP ' s Ogilvy has a PR practice and Publicis ' Intelligent Creativity also includes PR agency MSL. WPP ' s VML includes former activities (e.g Wunderman) which are more linked to CRM. Omnicom singles out healthcare specialised agencies, whereas this vertical is incorporate into creative for others. To assess agencies ' exposure to " creative " , we recoup revenue split information given by each company

with headcount disclosure made by individual agencies. From that disclosure, we estimate Omnicom has 51,000+ individuals employed in its creative agencies , compared to 47,000 at WPP, 22,000 at Publicis, 10,000 at Havas and 9,000 at Dentsu , the other major agency holdcos. We calculate this implies $5.5bn+ of revenue generated in creative at Omnicom excluding healthcare and $6.5bn+ including the specialised creative healthcare agencies such as the ex IPG Health. In total, based on gross revenue, we believe creative is equivalent to 20% of the new group ' s revenue and 25% including healthcare. Exhibit 31 : We reckon Omnicom has ~30% of revenue exposed to creative overall Creative as % of net revenue (excluding production) Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 32 : This can notably be inferred from reported headcount for major creative networks Self declared headcount of major creative agenies/networks Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report, trade press articles BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH …and is embarking into significant changes

Past examples at other holding agencies show that internal restructuring (mergers, layoffs) can lead to near-term underperformance. While this is not the only culprit, WPP ' s waves of internal mergers (2018: VML and Y&R, Wunderman and JWT and in 2023 VMLY&R and Wunderman Thompson) have, in our view, perturbed day-to-day operations. By its own admission, via establishing its " Power of One " strategy , Publicis also dented growth in 2016-19. Here, OAG will go through in our view significant changes: OAG will house three flagship networks: BBDO, TBWA (previously part of Omnicom) and McCann (previously part of IPG). This makes strategic sense given they are today the largest networks in terms of headcount. A fourth pillar, which will regroup the smaller, and generally specialised, US-focused creative agencies (GS&B, Carmichael-Lynch, Deutsch …

) remains. Previously owned by IPG, MullenLowe and FCB agencies are sunset and folded into TBWA and BBDO respectively. Omnicom ' s DDB is also folded into TBWA. Per their websites, DDB employs 8,000 people while TBWA has 11,000. Combining agencies and employees that were not part of the same holding company before creates elevated friction risks. There will also be material leadership changes: Troy Ruhanen remains global CEO but underneath , Tyler Turnbull is moving from FCB CEO to be come CEO of McCann (current CEO Daryl Lee is elevated to Chairman), Chaka Sobhani is moving from DDB to become head creative for TBWA and Javier Campopiano, formerly of McCann, is taking a global creative role. The trade press has also reported of numerous changes at the regional and local levels. Exhibit 33 : We estimate ~40% of new Omnicom headcount could be in "advertising" Omnicom headcount split Source: BofA Global Research estimates BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH We would expect s taff reduction to

be concentrated in this part of the business. More so than other parts of the organisation, c reative agencies are largely people driven businesses. We estimate that in total, pre synergies, Omnicom Advertising Group employs 50,000+ people or ~40% of total group headcount, despite representing ~25% of revenue. Omnicom has not disclosed which business units or agencies will bear the brunt of the 4,000 job cuts but we would expect a significant amount to fall in that bucket . P roduction : growing fast but smaller than rivals Omnicom set up a centralised production unit in June 2024, unifying Omnicom Studios, eg+, Designory, Mother Tongue, Link9. Back then, this unit had 3,000 employees. IPG also has production capabilities through Craft, which comes with ~1,400 headcount . Sergio Lopez Ferrero, who joined from Publicis where he had a similar title , has been confirmed as CEO for the unit. We think this business unit is an exciting part of the Omnicom ' s portfolio, as clients require more and more ads material. However, we believe this business to be likely

smaller for Omnicom compared to peers. WPP ' s Hogarth declares headcount of 7,500 while Publicis Production is at ~6,000. A more unified structure, but still not as integrated as best-in-class peers We think Omnicom ' s strategic decision to integrate its various disciplines under a more clearly defined management structure is a positive one . Nevertheless, the new Omnicom does not appear quite at the level of Publicis ' " Power of One " , which also aims at removing silos between business units (e.g creative and media). Omnicom will have additional scale in Media, but does it matter? Scale plays an important role in the success of media agencies as it gives them better negotiating power vis- à -vis platforms and media owners, access to premium data and technology. Having global scale also make them able to service global clients across multiple geographies effectively. Media remits indeed then need to be awarded on a global or super regional basis. Exhibit 34 : Omnicom set to manage the largest amount of billings at c $70bn … Media billings under management ($bn) Source:

BofA Global Research estimates, Comvergence BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 35 : …yet we think it has the smallest overall revenue exposure to this discipline at 36% Media as % of revenue (2025) Source: BofA Global Research estimates, Comvergence BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH The good news is that we expect the new Omnicom will leapfrog competition when it comes to total billings. Adding up Omnicom Media Group with IPG Mediabrands, we arrive at global billings of ~$72bn in 2024 and ~45,500 professionals in that discipline. This compares to WPP $64.5bn (41,000 headcount) and Publicis $54.7bn (31,700). Dentsu with $27bn (18,600), Havas $11bn (10,000) and Horizon Media $7.6bn.

Within top 1,000 advertisers, new Omnicom billings total $48.6bn, versus WPP $47.8bn and Publicis $40.6bn. Legacy Omnicom, WPP and Publicis tend to derive a larger proportion (~75%) from these very large advertisers, while legacy IPG for example only had 57% of billings from those usually multinational clients. Regionally, the new group will have leadership in North America, tied with Publicis, #2 in Europe behind WPP. It will be also #2 across Asia, but in that region independents agencies tend to dominate. However, scale is not the only key success factor as the example of WPP Media illustrates: despite being the largest media agencies worldwide in billings size, it has faced several large client losses in the past two years. Rather, two other factors are critical and we believe the jury is still out whether new Omnicom will be able to successfully leverage its scale in the same way that Publicis does: Integration of the various media agencies:

Post IPG acquisition, Omnicom will own 5 main media agencies, more so than peers: OMD, PHD, Hearts & Science, UM and Initiative. At this stage, it remains unclear to what extent the capabilities of all these various networks will be combined or not. Ownership of first-party data and how it is leveraged: New Omnicom will have no shortage of data but a key question remains how it is effectively integrated in its media operations. Publicis has done this with significant success but this is less evident at either Omnicom or IPG. Omnicom has historically developed an internal proprietary platform, Omni, designed to unify audience insights, media planning and creative optimisation. This has been complimented by the acquisition of Flywheel ' s commerce solution in early 2024. IPG for its part has relied on its 2018 acquisition of Acxiom, an identity graph and resolution company, to develop Kinesso in late 2023. Share repurchases are important but matter less than actual underlying revenue growth

If our estimate is right that Omnicom will buy back $1-1.5bn of shares in 2026-27, this would be equivalent to an annual buyback yield of 4-6%, which is above the average S&P 500 of ~2% This however does not always guarantee share price outperformance. A few noteworthy counter examples: Cable company Charter increased its share repurchases from $1.3bn in 2024 to $6bn in 2025 in 2025, yet shares have had a rough ride in 2025, down 40% YTD. MGM Resort increased its share repurchases from $1bn in 2021 to $2.8bn in 2022, $2.3bn in 2023, $1.4bn in 2024 but shares are down 20% from their late 2021 peak. Omnicom has historically driven a material part of its EPS growth through share repurchases: for example, since 2022, 40-45% of total EPS growth has been driven through that method.

BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 37 : Omnicom's valuation is usually correlated to organic sales growth developments Omnicom organic sales growth and annual P/E Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report, Bloomberg BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH In our view, the biggest driver of agencies ' share price performance is expansion or contraction of the P/E multiple. In turn, valuation is primarily dependant on market ' s expectations around organic sales growth. If, as we believe, Omnicom ' s top-line growth is likely to disappoint then we ' d expect valuation to remain depressed. Even if it picks up, it is noteworthy that, despite delivering consistently organic net sales growth >5% for the past few years, Publicis just trades at ~11x 2026E P/E. Also, we argue that capital allocation choices creates long lasting impact in agencies ' organic sales growth performance provided, obviously, that those acquisitions are integrated and scaled properly. Publicis has historically been the most acquisitive agency in the peer group with ~

€ 12bn spent on acquisitions since 2014. This caused some integration headache s (notably during the first years post the Sapient acquisition) but today the group boasts significantly better organic sales growth than rivals. Such aggressive M&A strategy has provided the group with uniquely scaled IT engineering capabilities (17% of workforce). Later, it acquired first-party data platforms Epsilon (2019) and Lotame (2025). The combination of all of these has allowed Publicis to launch in early 2024 " coreAI " , an internal platform which unifies and leverages Publicis ' wealth of proprietary data made 2.3bn consumer profiles, trillions of data points and 1 petabyte of content assets. Concurrently, since the launch of coreAI, Publicis has enjoyed a record streak of new client wins : Kenvue, Magnum Ice Cream Mars, Paramount, Coke North America, TJX, Aldi, Friesland Campina, PayPal … only in 2025. Recent acquisitions in commerce (Mars United) and influencer marketing (Influential, BR Media, Captiv8) seemingly are the

bedrock for future organic growth in our view.

Lately , Omnicom (Flywheel for $950m in 2024) and IPG (Acxiom for $2.3bn in 2018) have recently been more acquisitive but these acquisitions have not been integrated and scaled in the same way as Publicis ' . For example Flywheel, which was growing revenue mid-teens prior to its acquisition

by Omnicom has led to faster growth for Omnicom overall, or even in its Precision Marketing division where it is housed .

We would also encourage investors during this phase to look at constant currency growth, and not just organic, as some of these " disposals " may effectively be treated as termination of activities . Compared to other holding companies, Omnicom operates across a lot of various marketing disciplines. Its corporate website lists nine different practices while its divisional reporting splits revenue into seven buckets versus just three for Publicis (Connected Media, Intelligent Creativity, Technology), WPP (Global Integrated Agencies, PR, Speciality) or Havas (Media, Creative, Health). Omnicom has a long history of periodically reviewing its portfolio. While the strategy was paused in 2024-25, we

see scope for it to resume apace in 2026 which could negative revenue and earnings. Recall, Omnicom has highlighted that at least 10,000 positions will be reduced through asset disposals or discontinuations. There may be another 3,700 which also get trimmed in 2026 either through synergies or dispositions. Between 2017 and 202 4 , Omnicom disposed of assets that in total generated ~$ 2.5 bn+ of revenue , net of acquired revenue (e.g Flywheel) . However, Omnicom has not generated tangible proceeds from these disposals. C ash flow statements show that, in contrast, Omnicom has spent a net $1.2bn on M&A ($700m dispositions, $1.9bn acquisitions) between 2017 and 2024.

To be clear, we think portfolio evaluation and pruning would make strategic sense as potentially it would increase Omnicom ' s exposure to areas which are presumed to be faster growth and higher margin, such as Media or Precision Marketing. In practice though, in the past, the disposal of underperforming units failed to translate into a faster

top-line performance tho ugh on the positive side , adjusted operating margin has markedly improved from 14.2% in 2017 to 15.6% in 2025. Exhibit 43 : Despite an aggressive pruning strategy, Omnicom's organic growth today is similar versus 10 years ago Omnicom organic sales growth and net impact from M&A Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 44 : Disposals have nevertheless contributed to operating margin improvement Omnicom adjusted EBITA margin Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH While some dispositions have been clearly identified and names in filings or press releases (e.g Sellbytel, ICON, Russia), most of them have not. Recall, organic sales growth is presented as the " output " of revenue growth minus impact of FX and net impact of acquisitions and dispositions. If the impact of dispositions is overstated, then this could lead to organic sales growth being artificially boosted.

We calculate these dispositions could be 5-6% dilutive to group EPS. To get to this figure, we make the following assumptions: ~$125,000 -1 8 0,000 revenue per employee part of the disposed units. The range depends if Omnicom disposes of staff intensive units or not. This would imply that $1.2-1.8bn of revenue might be disposed of, or about 6% of the group . Omnicom has not indicated in which areas specifically these disposals will be made, but we expect they will primarily be located in smaller creative shops, bra n ding & retail commerce, experiential and execution and support. These activities represented overall $3.7bn of revenue in 2024 or 15% of revenue . If disposals are indeed made in the aforementioned areas, margins are also likely to be lower. We believe proceeds will be largely immaterial thus cannot be used for extra share repurchases to mitigate dilution. Risk #3: IPG assets may need some reinvestment in the first place

As we laid out in the initial section of the report, Omnicom appears to be acquiring IPG assets at a highly attractive multiple. Our concern is that IPG assets may require some reinvestments in the first place, which could partly mitigate bigger than expected synergies. In particular, we think IPG media agencies may need to have their principal media buying capabilities upgraded. Exhibit 45 : IPG's profitability has increased meaningfully above peers, particularly in 2025 Agencies' EBITA margin (as reported) Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 46 : IPG's headcount had already reduced significantly prior to the acquisition by Omnicom IPG total headcount Source: BofA Global Research estimates, company report BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

That said, we are rather perplexed by the very sharp margin improvement which IPG has delivered over the years. Adjusted EBITA margin have improved from 14% in 2019 to 16.8% in 2021 thanks to rigorous property costs management notably. They remained approximately flattish until 2024 (16.5%) before shooting up to >18% in 2025, outpacing the 16.6% which was targeted in the S-4 filing. This time, the prime factor has been headcount reduction as IPG reduced organic headcount by 5% in 2025. Such margin improvement pattern is rather abnormal in an industry where the high share of people costs in the overall cost base (80%+ of costs) mean it is generally difficult to deliver meaningful operating leverage. This is likely even more the case given IPG ' s revenue growth has been flat to declining in the past three years.

We rate Omnicom Underperform. While we think the acquisition of IPG will deliver better than expected synergies and lift share buybacks, we are concerned with weak revenue growth in the first two years post the deal, due to higher risks of client loss, accelerating attrition in creative and bigger than expected dilution from portfolio clean up actions which the management team has announced.
