Multiple Dec. '25 reports suggest that TTD is now willing to 'negotiate' on take -rates and offer incentives (aka rebates) to hit certain spending levels within JBPs , as it faces an exodus of client spend to Amazon's DSP. Industry observers consider this a return of pricing as a factor in DSP competition. TTD also lost a third C-Suite executive, with a well-respected 12-year veteran engineering VP leaving, following the departure of its long-time CRO and CFO.

Concurrent with the Oxford English Dictionary tagging 'rage bait' as their word of the year, a policy change at X to show the geographic location of accounts revealed that thousands of inflammatory accounts from purported US citizens were emanating from Russia, India, Nigeria, E. Europe, etc. confirming something forensic ad tech researchers have long thought: there is an entire industry devoted to stoking division and provoking responses to generate ad inventory.

The long-awaited closing of the Omnicom-IPG merger resulted in the sunsetting of multiple venerated agency brands, but also brought 14k job cuts (just ahead of the holidays) and saw OMC management take eight of the top nine roles. Integration risks only add to the challenges faced by agencies in preserving their role as intermediaries between marketers and the increasing spend devoted to Walled Gardens.

Chime updated the fee structure for MyPay, shifting from a flat $2 fee to variable pricing (3%, with a $2 min. and $5 max.) from Jan '26 . We think it needed to increase limits for users, while this should boost MyPay growth. We see multiple catalysts in '26 (new MyPay fe es, Chime Card, New Products) next to user growth. The MyPay optional instant advance fee will change (Chime, Reddit , Nov. '25 ) / Arete Research: Chime: Hitting the Right Notes (Nov. '25 )

The public reaction to a recent interview between the Roblox CEO and The New York Times was overwhelmingly negative. User safety shortfalls, no matter how long ago or infrequent (relative to the ~150m DAUs), remain in the public sphere and are now attracting legal action from several US states. Further investment is likely required, in our view. Roblox was also recently barred by Russia; we have confirmed with the company the region is relatively immaterial to bookings.

Nintendo has entered into a share transfer agreement with Bandai Namco to acquire its Singaporean studio (BNSS) in order to strengthen its development. Current operations will be continued (BNSS contributed to the Splatoon series, for example). We view this small acquisition as a sign of intent from Nintendo to maintain its 1P software innovation, alongside deepening ties with Bandai Namco (the latter owning a 2% stake in the former) .

This is our weekly commentary on AI-related developments and news relevant to our Internet/Digital Consumer coverage.

According to updates in its publicly visible robots.txt file, Amazon has stepped up efforts to exclude crawlers from accessing its site, expanding its ' disallowed ' rules to cover both Search and the user agent from ChatGPT. Amazon already had a public spat (a 'cease and desist' letter) with Perplexity when it tried to crawl the site for its own e-commerce service, while it has its own AutoBuy agent and Rufus shopping assistant. Amazon's AI strategy aims to build a complete AI system, from Nova Forge to Trainium and AI Factories, allowing enterprises to run their own models on dedicated infrastructure, and control data governance. Press: Amazon quietly blocks more of OpenAI's ChatGPT web crawlers from accessing its site (Modern Retail, Nov. '25 )

OAI's CEO in a widely pu blished ' leaked ' memo -has said that the company must put the highest priority on catching up to Google's new Gemini3 models, while putting less emphasis on its many other projects (notably its effort to build a scaled digital advertising business based on lead generation fees. OpenAI says it has more work to do on the day-to-day experience of its chatbot, including improving personalisation features, increasing its speed and reliability, and addressing a wider range of questions. Press: Open AI's A ltman declares code red to improve ChatGPT as Google threatens AI lead (Wall Street Journal, Dec. '25 )

Data from Sensor Tower showed that Rufus usage during BFCM reached 40% of all shopping sessions on AMZN at its peak. While we are sceptical over the accuracy of this figure, especially as AMZN hasn't been aggressively pushing Rufus to consumers, it is encouraging to see conversion higher than non-Rufus sessions, suggesting AI-related shopping could be beneficial for e-commerce growth. Press: Rufus Usage reaches 40% (Sensor Tower , Dec. '25 )

While there is risk of sample bias and relatively small datasets, a survey of 2,000 UK consumers found that 61% say they are using AI tools for shopping, with ChatGPT and Gemini as the top two options, followed by Alexa and Siri, while 64% think retailers should use AI to improve the shopping experience for their customers. Another Adobe survey found much lower levels of AI adoption, around 25% of UK users. Press: Retail Reality Check: AI is reshaping how consumers shop (CI&T , Dec. '25 )

As the race to scale up datacentre capacity shifts to obtaining financing, the company leading third-party deployment of Google TPUs -FluidStack -is looking to raise $700m to finance its first non-NVDA datacentre builds, having already secured a $10bn line of credit from Macquarie. One sticking point may be the overall upstream capacity available to TPU partners Broadcom and Mediatek to effect production of TPUs in the required volumes in '26 and '27, alongside Google's own internal priority needs. Press: AI Cloud provider aiding Google ' s chip push talks raise 700m (The Information, Dec. '25 )

The launch of DeepSeek V3.2 ( link ), featuring DeepSeek 's Sparse Attention architecture (DSA), signals further innovation coming from China, matching GPT-5 (OpenAI) and Gemini 3 (Google) across various different benchmarks. DeepSeek continues to offer its open-source reasoning capabilities at now significantly lower prices (for API usage, both for output and input token, with prices down 30%+), both vs. earlier DeepSeek versions, but certainly also comping it to its leading Western world peers. The DSA architecture reduces attention complexity, leading to much lower latency and significant workload

savings (a typical workload processing 100k input tokens and generating 100k output tokens costs roughly $0.07 with DeepSeek V3.2 vs. $1.13 with GPT-5; link ), while maintaining performance (see Fig. 1). The launch auf V3.2 (which is optimised for non-CUDA ecosystems, including Huawei's and Cambricon's hardware stacks, BABA's T -Head PPU or BIDU's Kunlun 2) should further accelerate the genAI adoption in China, likely benefiting most domestic stakeholders (e.g., Cloud operators, chip/server makers, AI agent developers) and putting visible downward pressure on competitor LLM API pricing. This debate over which LLMs have a 'lead' or not will only get more heated, with the Salesforce CEO saying ' LLMs are the new disk drives: commodity infrastructure you hotswap for whoever's cheapest + best. The fantasy that the

model is a moat just expired ' ( link ; X/Twitter, 5 Dec. '25) .

| Digital Consumer      | While both Sony and Nintendo products continue to outperform Xbox and keep growing unit shipments of the PS5 and Switch2, the industry is poised to shift to more software- led growth in '26, culminating with the highly anticipated release of GTA VI before the holidays. In smartphones, Apple's successfulnew iPhone launch looks to have sucked the oxygen out of smartphone markets, with Xiaomi reporting weaker shipments and guiding to lower sales, while struggling togetallocationsofmemoryasLenovoreported highergrowthfor itsMotorolasmartphone division.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| e-Commerce            | Data from Adobe, Salesforce and Mastercard points to~7% e-commerce growth across CyberWeek, showing continued consumer spend despite tough comps from a blowout holiday period in 4Q24. BNPL continues togrow as a %ofoverall BFCMsales, with Klarna noting Nov'25GMVgrew 45%, while Adobe data suggest BNPL growth accelerated vs. '24. This clearly favours BNPL providers (PYPL, AFRM, KLAR, XYZ); however, Bankrate and Transunion data suggests an increasing number of consumers turning to credit for holiday purchases, which in turn may suggest weakening consumerdiscretionary budgets.                                                                                                                                                |
| Payments              | At investor conferences, payment companymanagements have generally been talking down4Q25 volume growth. Block guided to 4Q25 Square growth of 10%, down from 'low - double digits', blaming weather conditions in October. Meanwhile, PayPal 's CFO noted macro pressure in September, which continued through October and November, and now expects 4Q25 branded checkout growth to be at least a couple points slower than in 3Q25. However,wewould note thatSHOP has not seen a similar slowdown with SHOPPAY, whichgrew39%over BFCM, ahead of overallBFCMgrowthof27%,suggesting PayPal is losing share to peers.                                                                                                                              |
