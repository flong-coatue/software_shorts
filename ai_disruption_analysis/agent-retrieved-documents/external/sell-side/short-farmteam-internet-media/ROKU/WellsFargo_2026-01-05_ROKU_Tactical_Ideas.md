Company Update - January 5, 2026

We expect the ~20% same-store sales Platform growth in 4Q'25 to extend to H1'26. The mid-term election is also set to be a record, so we think ROKU's '26 Adj. EBITDA guidance will impress. Positive OI/NI + strong FCF = steady valuation & higher ests. Strong revision cycle. The Street is modeling same-store Platform revenue growth decel'ing from ~20% in 2H'25 to ~12% in '26 on tough comps & low visibility around the AMZN DSP integration. We think this is overly conservative as 1H'26 should benefit from multiple initiatives (e.g., DSP integrations, Frndly, Howdy, price increases, M&E, etc.), while 2H'26 should see meaningful lift from World Cup and a record mid-term political cycle.

Bullish on revisions. For Platform growth, we expect a slight decel in '26 from Q1 to Q2 and then a bigger decel in H2'26 as political comes in. We also forecast $135mm in political in '26 with an upside bias. Using a conservative 51.5% Platform gross margin, our opex estimates and Street's adjustments to EBITDA derives ~$650mm in '26 Adj. EBITDA, or +15% vs. Street. While buyside may be above sellside, we still think there is scope for positive estimate revisions to move the stock higher.

Results setup. We also see add'l upside opportunity in home screen monetization with sports heading to streaming + the box office normalizing at structurally higher levels in '26 ($10bn est.). '26 should start to showcase ROKU as a solid execution story with industry-leading scale, making the stock a clear expression of share shift in ad budgets from linear to CTV. The aforementioned $650mm in potential '26 EBITDA implies a ~ $130/sh near-term range based on our 27x target EV/EBITDA multiple. Risks to our Tactical call. 1.) Device margins and gross profit could be depressed by supply costs and competition; 2.) Platform growth could decelerate if the ad market comes under pressure from macro trends; 3.) Opex could move higher if ROKU enters a major incremental product cycle to keep pace w/ competition; and 4.) Consolidation or rationalization amongst streamers could pressure M&E, SSD, and AVOD revenues.

We value ROKU on ~27x average CY26E EV/EBITDA (25x on Platform - unchanged - plus Device losses). Platform revenue growth acceleration from subscription services, ads/fill rate, growing engagement on TRC, home screen, and structural political tailwinds are reasons we think the multiple is justified. Our target is $116, which is 25x on our 26E P/FCF when factoring in a buyback w/ excess cash to reduce the share count.

ROKU is accelerating as AVOD, homescreen, and subscription revenues leverage the nearly 100mm Roku CTV households. Operating leverage is expanding EBITDA margins and generating strong FCF, and ROKU has no debt. Political is a long-term share gain tailwind. We rate ROKU Overweight as a long-term play on the CTV ad TAM with stable drivers.

*As of 01/02/26 Source: Wells Fargo Securities, LLC estimates and Factset.

Roku could drive positive momentum on its shares if it is able to deliver faster Platform revenue growth vs. expectations. Macro volatility could also improve. Opex could also be lower vs. base case assumptions. In that case, we think EBITDA could be ~20% above our base case implying 30x EV/ EBITDA = $149/sh.

· As a high-growth stock, earnings are a major ROKU catalyst. Key KPIs include growth in active accounts, time spent per account, and Platform ARPU; · The Roku Channel's total growth and impact on Platform revenue growth and gross margins is a key driver; · ROKU will continue to look for avenues for its O/S incl. its own TV and OEM partners. The distribution landscape is constantly changing; · Increased home screen monetization and changes in M&E trends; · Macro impacts could be significant.

Roku is a TV streaming platform w/ approx. 100mm active accounts that stream >100bn hours per year. ROKU distributes its O/S via dongles and smart TVs, and monetizes streaming time via the connected TV homescreen, AVOD app ad share, and The Roku Channel. Competition in the CTV space is intensifying, and the space is getting more crowded. ROKU is at risk of losing share or having to invest significantly more. The macro also creates ads and Device pressures. Our downside case of 20x EV/EBITDA is ROKU's trough valuation historically. 15x = $72/sh.

· Macro impacts could be significant · Device margins and gross profit could be depressed by supply costs and competition · Platform growth could decelerate, esp. the ad market comes under pressure from macro trends · Opex could move higher if ROKU enters a major incremental product cycle to keep pace w/ competition • Consolidation or rationalization amongst streamers could pressure M&E, SSD, and AVOD revenues
