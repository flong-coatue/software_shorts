Price objective basis & risk Roku, Inc. (ROKU) Our $140 price objective is based on approximately 25x our 2027 FCF estimate, which is an approx. 30% premium to Advertising/ad tech and M&E/Streaming. We believe this premium is justified as Roku earnings growth compares favorably to some of the higher-growth media names under our coverage universe. Downside risks to our PO: increasing competition in streaming TV OS and/or streaming devices, the prospect that Roku will be unable to improve ad monetization, slower-than-anticipated overall streaming adoption, lower streaming viewership hours, and macroeconomic/ad market deterioration.

Roku, Inc. Several Irons in the Fire We commend Roku ' s transformation over the last several years as the company ha s taken great strides to diversify their revenue base (e.g. opening up to 3 rd party DSP relationships) and reduce their overreliance on M&E. This progress has not gone unnoticed with shares appreciating considerably (nearly tripling) from the 2022 lows. However, we remain bullish on the opportunity ahead. Roku has several initiatives that have the potential to sustain a healthy rate of topline growth such as: 1) self-serve advertising, 2) continued ramp into 3 rd party DSP advertising platforms, 3) low fill rates which provide greater flexibility to price along t he demand curve, 4) optionality with their subscription business via newer initiatives (e.g. Howdy) or cross-selling from Frndly acquisition and 5) moderating headwinds in M&E. P otential p ath to $1bn in adj. EBITDA in CY27

While Roku has multiple strategic initiatives underway, the timing and magnitude of their impact remain difficult to quantify. To frame the range of potential outcomes, we outline several scenarios below. Relative to our base case, we see multiple upside drivers to our CY27 forecasts. In our bull case, Roku could generate ~$1B in adj. EBITDA , well above current Street expectations. Assigning precise probabili ties of achieving all elements of the bull case remains challenging , however, we believe Roku has a credible path to outperform our base case, posing considerable upside potential . O ur increased CY26E and CY27E forecasts reflect several of these underlying drivers. Profitability inflection changes narrative In addition to Roku ' s solid revenue trajectory, we believe the recent profitability inflection is underappreciated. Roku achieved GAAP profitability in 2Q25 , and if sustained over a full calendar year, this milestone could pave the way for index inclusion and a broaden ing of their

investor base. With improving operating leverage and a scalable model, we see Roku evolving into a compelling FCF/share compounder . Reiterate Buy and raise PO to $ 1 40 We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our PO to $1 40 PO (from $11 5 ) reflecting ~ 25 x our raised CY2 7 E FCF/share as we roll forward our multiple one year (from prior 27x) . In our view, Roku has notable scope to keep expanding its top and bott om line and should benefit from several favorable industry trends along with company-specific actions. These include 1) growth in CTV advertising, 2) secular growth in streaming video domestically and internationally, and 3) improving fill rates in its advertising business, which we estimate are <40% via third-party partnerships with DSPs .

Roku, Inc. Multiple irons in the fire Roku shares appreciated 46 % in 2025 , significantly outperforming the broader market. We attribute this strength to consistent execution across several long-term strategic initiatives, including the expansion of third-party DSP partnerships to better monetize its substantial advertising opportunity. A key tenet of our bullish thesis has been Roku ' s ability to effectively leverage its large and highly engaged user base. While the company has made meaningful progress, we continue to see considerable runway for further monetization and growth . Put simply, we believe Roku is at an inflection point with sustainable growth drivers and margin leverage that positions the company to be a FCF/share compounde r over a multi-year peri od . In our view, 3Q results and management commentary suggests the company is making continued progress in this financial transformation , which has the potential to change the profile of the business (more valuation support with the company now becoming GAAP profitable ) alongside attracting a new class of investors . Over the last several years , Roku '

s partnerships with 3rd party DSPs (e.g. Trade Desk) was a departure from their prior strategy and meaningfully expanded sources of revenue demand and accelerated their video advertising business. Going forward, we see newer opportunities such as self-serve video advertising, international expansion, initiatives within their subscription business and improvement in underlying trends within M&E as potential drivers. Exhibit 1 : Platform revenue growth is a key driver of our outlook Investment Scenarios-Key Assumptions Source: BofA Global Research BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 2 : We see a Bull case of $200/share vs. bear case of $78 Equity Risk/Reward Profile Source: BofA Global Research BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Massive scale and ramping profitability justifies multiple We reiterate our Buy rating on Roku and raise our price objective to $1 40 (from $11 5 ), based on ~2 5 x our revised CY27E FCF , as we roll forward our multiple one year (from prior 27x) . Our valuation reflects the benefit from Roku '

s strategic pivot toward monetization, disciplined cost management, and strong FCF conversion. The company ' s growth framework of double-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit expense growth, substantial FCF conversion as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, and capital returns supports compounded FCF/share growth of >20% annually over the next several years . Notably , Roku ' s recent GAAP profitability also marks a key milestone, potentially enabling future index inclusion and attracting a broader investor base. In our view, this transition is underappreciated.

Roku currently trades at ~20x our CY27E FCF, which appears attractive for a business we project will grow free cash flow considerably over the next two years. Roku's FCF CAGR compares favorably to some of the higher growth media companies under our coverage universe, which in our view, justifies the premium multiple. Notably, our current forecast does not contemplate capital returns (beyond offsetting dilution of SBC), which given the company's balance sheet and expected FCF generation could be an additional source of upside to our FCF/share estimates . Blue sky case implies significant upside Relative to our base case forecast, we see several potential drivers of substantial upside to our CY27 forecasts. In our bullish scenario we see a path to $ 511m n in incremental revenues which at ~50% incremental margins translate into $1bn in adj. EBITDA by 2027 and would represent significant upside to our/consensus forecast . From a top-down perspective, Roku ' s revenue drivers can be categorized into three buckets: 1) Video

Advertising, 2) SSD and 3) M&E. Within those, Video Advertising and SSD have the greatest sources of revenue upside, albeit with different incremental margin profiles (Exhibit 3 & 4). From a bottoms up perspective, t he key drivers of this include: 1) the ramp of Amazon ' s new DSP relationship , which could potentially contribute $1 2 5 mn in revenue by 2027 (in our base case) , 2) contribution from self-serve advertising as this introduces a new class of SMB advertisers to CTV , 3) a re-acceleration of M&E revenue off a CY2 5 trough aided by a recovery in spend, new ad formats and introduction of new advertising categories and 4) faster growth in streaming distribution revenue driven by greater uptake of Roku Payment services (aided by cross-selling of Frndly and ramp of Howdy) , increased market share of Roku operating systems in the market along with continued growth in the subscription streaming market (volume and price) and 5) continued expansion internationally .

EBITDA (mn) $ 5 87 $1,0 34 Source: BofA Global Research BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Our bear case assumes: 1) slower growth in advertising which can be attributed to a wide variety of factors including a macro slowdown, 2) lower growth in video ad impressions, 3) CPM degradation from current levels, 4) no meaningful improvement in fill rates, 5) more significant headwinds in M&E (especially following what appears to be a wave of industry consolidation)

and 6) a deceleration in SSD revenue to a high single digit CAGR (organic) . This scenario equates to nearly $ 452 mn in lower revenues which at a ~5 0 % incremental margin translates into ~$ 213 mn in EBITDA. While difficult to handicap the probability that Roku c ould achieve all the outcomes in our bull case, we do see several opportunities for Roku to outperform vs. our base case forecasts. Exhibit 5 : Our bull case scenario assumes Platform revenues grow at a 19% CAGR from CY24-CY27E (vs. 1 5 % in our base case) driving total company EBITDA margin of 16% (vs. 1 3 % in our base case) Bull/Bear Platform CY27E revenue scenarios Source: BofA Global Research BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Amazon DSP ramp a catalyst for Platform upside in June, Roku announced a new exclusive partnership with Amazon that deepens the relationship between the two companies. This comes on the heels of a clear push by Amazon to build out their ad-tech capabilities.

Under the integration, advertisers will have access to the largest authenticated CTV footprint in the U.S. (over 80mn U.S. CTV households) exclusively through Amazon ' s DSP. A key attribute to this agreement lies within the Unified Identity Resolution which allows Amazon ' s DSP to recognize logged-in users across Roku devices/apps enabling more precise targeting and cross-device measurement. In other words, this deeper integration should improve performance, planning and measurement for all advertisers and early tests suggest this new solution reached 40% more unique viewers with the same budget and reduced how often the same person saw an ad by nearly 30%. All said, the combination of Roku's scale with exposure to nearly half of all broadband households in the US, with Amazon's breadth of data is powerful. The benefits of this partnership for advertisers include : 1) D riving greater reach with precision to ensure ads are being delivered to i ntended audiences 2) improving measurement to show how advertisements drive outcomes across the funnel 3) C ontrol ad frequency

to ensure the right number of ads are being delivered to viewers to improve the overall viewing experience and reduce wasted impressions We view this partnership with AMZN as another proof point that Roku intends to be more flexible and drive further interoperability within their platform. This also builds on their relationships with other DSPs, and we continue to see a significant opportunity from improving monetization of their advertising inventory going forward . W hile difficult to perfectly triangulate the magnitude, we suspect another significant DSP ramp was TTD in 2024, which we now assume generates ~$200mn in revenues for Roku today (likely to continue growing as CTV advertising grows) .

However, despite the promise, adoption at scale has yet to truly materialize. Many SMBs have continued to rely on more familiar digital channels like search and social media, where platforms such as Google and Meta offered more straightforward, performance-driven advertising solutions. More recently, the rapid proliferation of streaming platforms, especially those introducing ad-supported tiers, has reignited optimism around video advertising for SMBs. These platforms offer the combination of access to premium high-quality video (a s

TV advertising had always done) coupled with the targeting capabilities that digital advertis ers promise , ultimately creating a new opportunity to recapture advertising dollars that had previously migrated to these large walled gardens . However , a few years into the proliferation of CTV services, SMB adoption has yet to materialize in a meaningful way . While we understand the skepticism, we believe industry dynamics are finally ripe for CTV to capitalize on this opportunity. In short , we view the convergence of two dynamics : 1) the rise of AI-powered video creation tools and 2) the emergence of user-friendly self-serve advertising platforms as the key catalyst to facilitate greater adoption . AI tools now enable SMBs to produce high-quality video content quickly and affordably, removing one of the biggest barriers to entry. At the same time, self-serve ad platforms are becoming more sophisticated and user-friendly, allowing businesses with limited marketing resources to launch targeted campaigns with minimal friction. In our view,

Roku is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this shift. As one of the leading streaming platforms with their ad-manager product , Roku can offer SMBs a simple solution for video advertising. Its self-serve platform, combined with AI-driven creative tools and audience targeting, could unlock a new wave of demand from local and regional advertisers who previously found video inaccessible. Exhibit 7 : Simplicity will be a key driver of user adoption over time ROKU Self-Serve Advertising Overview Source: BofA Global Research, Roku Company Website BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH If Roku can successfully lower the barriers to entry and demonstrate measurable ROI for SMBs, we think it could see the potential to tap into a vast and largely underpenetrated segment of the advertising market. This could not only diversify its revenue base but also help capture share from digital players by offering a differentiated advertising experience tailored to the streaming era. To put this opportunity into further context, we assume the US CTV market is ~$30bn and the local market represents ~10% of that market today , or $3bn (BIA)

. We expect the CTV market to continue growing and within that, local to maintain their share on a go forward basis . If over the next two years the CTV market grows high single digits annually , the market would grow to be $3 5 bn. Within that, if we assume Self-Serve becomes 30% of the local market , which is then comprised of a 25% share for Roku, this would represent a $262mn revenue opportunity. While we do not expect Roku to capture this in its entirety over the next two years (our base case assumes 35% of the opportunity is captured by ' 27 ; our bull case assumes 50% ), the opportunity should be significant over a multi-year period.

According to BIA ' s, core local television advertising is projected to be $13.9bn in 2026, which when coupled with a still sizeable local radio represents a large pool of addressable advertising dollars available for CTV and self-serve advertising . Put simply, i t does not require heroic assumptions around share shifts toward self-serve CTV to drive material revenue opportunities for Roku over time. Howdy Partners: The SSD Opportunity

Despite the rapid growth in streaming over the last decade, we believe there are still significant growth opportunities ahead. For Roku, at a high level, we see two key growth drivers: 1) continued adoption of streaming internationally in less penetrated markets and 2) price increases for streaming services in more developed markets. Netflix estimates there are 600mn addressable broadband households worldwide (relative to their ~ 3 25 mn + subscribers today) which suggests ample room for further subscriber growth over time. As Roku continues to expand internationally, they should be beneficiaries of this trend. In developed markets, such as the US, the streaming market is more saturated, and the industry has shifted from a subscriber acquisition strategy toward a monetization strategy. Given Roku ' s strong market position as an operating system, Roku stands to benefit from a " rising tides lifts all boats " dynamic via continued price increases for domestic streaming services. Drilling down to Roku specifically, their SSD business generates revenue predominately from users who have adopted Roku pay (Roku '

s service to physically pay for a streaming service) and the take rate they then receive (up to 30%). As shown in Exhibit 9 below, we see the most significant opportunity from users who adopt Roku Pay which stands at a little over 1/3 rd of their user base as this would be within the company ' s control (raising take rates could increase risks with media partners, increases of CTV share dependent on competitive dynamics). Also, given that less than 50% of the base is on Roku P ay, there is ample runway to drive further penetration over time. For perspective, for every 1% increase in users that adopt Roku P ay would drive ~ $4 5 mn in revenues, all else equal. Notably, there should not be significant operating costs associated with these incremental revenue streams (notwithstanding gross vs. net revenue booking dynamics) .

Earlier this year, the company announced the acquisition of Frndly TV, a budget-friendly live TV streaming service offering access to several linear channels. While the strategic rationale was initially questioned due to Frndly ' s exposure to linear content (and the associated secular declines within them) , we believe the true opportunity lies in its potential to drive subscription revenue. We estimate Frndly has nearly 1 million subscribers, and now that it operates as an owned-and-operated platform within the Roku ecosystem, Roku can migrate both the existing subscriber base and future incremental users into Roku Pay. As shown in Exhibit 1 0 , converting Frndly '

s subscriber base to Roku Pay represents a $68 million revenue opportunity. We note that a portion of Frndly ' s subscribers may already be using Roku Pay, so this figure may not be entirely incremental to Roku ' s current fundamentals (our bull case contemplates Roku recognizing half of this opportunity) . Exhibit 10 : We project a $68mn revenue opportunity from migrating all Frndly Subscribers to Roku Pay Frndly Cross Sell Opportunity For an accessible version Merrill clients call 800-637-7455; Merrill Edge Self-Directed clients call 877-653-4732 Frndly Cross Sell Opportunity Frndly Subscribers (000's) 1,000 x Roku Share of CTV % 50.00% x Year Streaming ARPU (ex. NFLX) 540.00 x Take Rate 25.00% = Theoretical Revenue Opportunity 67,500 Source: BofA Global Research BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Earlier this year , Roku also announced the launch of Howdy , a low cost ad-free streaming service which houses licensed content from

several of the largest studios. It appears the intent behind this service is to create an offering similar to that of FAST (free ad-supported streaming television) platforms (similar type of content), at a low subscription price in the place of ads. With Roku ' s existing user base and ability to drive the user experience, customer acquisition costs should be minimal and th ere appears to be a low risk optionality should this service gain traction. To the extent it does, it can serve as a hook for subscribers to migrate more of their subscriptions over to Roku Pay where the potential economics gained could extend beyond the $2.99 monthly subscription fee for the service. For perspective, our current forecasts contemplated minimal impact from Howdy. More broadly, in a fragmenting media landscape with linear television in a state of secular decline, there appears to be a market appetite for a solution that re-bundles several streaming services (essentially creating a new cable bundle 2.0). G iven Roku ' s positioning in the marketplace and extensive reach, they appear well positioned to capitalize on

this opportunity. While we do not contemplate this in our forecast, we think this also has the potential to drive meaningful incremental monetization opportunities over the next several years. M&E stabilizing In addition to the revenue drivers discussed above , we believe a t least a stabilization if not recovery in M&E revenues (along with M&E now representing a smaller % of total mix) can be a driver of platform revenues in ' 26 and beyond. M&E advertising on Roku has historically been driven by studios promoting new content on the Roku home screen to drive awareness and engagement. Historically, M&E was a much more significant percentage of total platform revenues (we estimate ~1/3 rd of platform revenue in 2022) especially given the recent rise of The Roku Channel, and ad-supported streaming services. This business has been negatively impacted by a confluence of factors over the last few years, including: 1) a pare back in content spending in 2022 with companies moving to a focus on profitability (which reduced content output alongside marketing expenses) and 2) the 2023 Hollywood

talent strikes (writers/actors) which shut down content production (thereby creating an additional headwind for content output). Both of these dynamics led to declines in production as exemplified in Exhibit 1 1 below. As a result, we estimate this business has declined mid-teens in both ' 23 and ' 24 and likely declining at least high single digits in ' 25 . Heading into ' 2 6 , with M&E appearing to trough, this sub-segment, at a minimum should no longer be as substantial of a drag to topline growth. Exhibit 11 : US TV production has declined from the 2021-2022 peaks 2023 saw a significant decline in TV seasons ordered and released Source: Business Insider and Ampere Analytics BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Exhibit 12 : Volume of TV scripted commissions ordered by global streamers Commissions were stable in the 1H25 vs. 1H24 in North America Source: Ampere Analysis BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH As shown in Exhibit 1 1 & 1 2 , w hile Volume of TV script commissions are declining in the

aggregate, they have stabilized in North America, whi ch represents an outsized percentage of Roku ' s businesses . In addition, the company has alluded to new ad formats and the potential to attract new advertising categories which all present incremental opportunities to drive growth and improve monetization within the M&E segment. Roku has even highlighted new unannounced UI c hanges which all present incremental opportunities to drive monetization over time . Moreover, as live events and sports continue to migrate over to streaming, this would also present additional opportunities for streaming services to promote key content on their respective platforms. We estimate incremental margins for M&E are very high and the extent revenues can return to growth (or at least be less of a drag) will also be a boost to profitability . The Roku Channel engagement is growing rapidly The Roku Channel is a free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) offering that has become a key driver of Roku ' s longer term monetization strategy. We view the success of The Roku Channel as a validation of Roku '

s broader strategy as it matches the scale Roku has acquired over time via their devices/hardware business with the superior technology prowess in controlling the user interface to drive engagement within their existing operating system. This flywheel has been a tremendous success story and has resulted in significant share gains as a percentage of TV time spent (Exhibit 13 & 14 ), boosting The Roku Channel as among the top streaming apps in the US (according to Nielsen Gauge). While The Roku Channel is coming up against challenging Y/Y comparisons we still expect healthy engagement growth going forward especially as the cost of various streaming services continue to increase and the option of a free service becomes more desirable.

Nielsen Gauge BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH Given this rapid growth in engagement, we still believe the opportunity to drive monetization is sizeable (even despite the rapid growth recently) . To put The Roku Channel opportunity into greater perspective, we have compared TRC to Tubi (owned by Fox), which we view as the most relevant comp. In 202 5 , we estimate Tubi generated approximately $ 1.25b n in revenue while TRC commanded just over $ 8 00mn in revenue. As shown in Exhibit 15 , we believe a big driver of this delta can be attributed to Tubi ' s higher fill rate. We acknowledge a few caveats to our analysis including: 1) Fill rates are typically an " output " metric and 2) our assumptions for MAUs (monthly active users) , time spent, and Nielsen Gauge are our assumptions of the averages over the course of 202 5 , however, these metrics may not be perfectly linear and can vary from month to month. Exhibit 15 : Tubi vs. The Roku Channel Comparison Tubi's higher fill rates can largely explain the relative difference in monetization

Desk to sell ads programmatically (including UID 2.0 in 2023), which we believe is contributing to Tubi ' s improved monetization (Roku has subsequently adopted UID 2.0 in August 2024). In addition, Tubi has the added benefit of being sold alongside Fox ' s entire portfolio, which includes some of the most premiere types of content ranging from the NFL, College Football, the Superbowl and Fox News. Therefore, Fox can bundle Tubi advertising sales with flagship content in such a way that would be challenging for Roku to replicate. Nonetheless, the wide gap between the two platforms represents a clear opportunity for The Roku Channel over time. As we highlighted above, expansion into new 3 rd party DSP relationships (e.g. AMZN) would drive advertising dollars toward TRC - in other words suggesting both of these opportunities could be concentric. For perspective, we estimate every 1% increase in fill rate would drive a $28mn revenue uplift, all else equal . While we don '

t expect fill rates to increase in a step function, we believe this to be a modest tailwind in the coming years which should drive improved monetization and revenues. We raise our forecast to reflect favorable drivers Given the aforementioned drivers in the business, we are raising our CY26E and CY27E forecasts. We now project CY26E revenue, adj. EBITDA and FCF of $5.39bn/$5 94mn /$6 66 mn, respectively (from $5.37bn/$560mn/$632mn, respectively). We also increase our CY27E revenue to $6.03bn and adj. EBITDA to $ 800 mn. Our raised forecasts largely reflect a balanced increase in both the video advertising and SSD parts of the business alongside operational efficiencies that drive operating leverage in the business. Exhibit 16 : We raise our CY26E forecast to reflect underlying momentum We now project $594mn in CY26E adj. EBITDA

We believe Roku provides an attractive combination of top line growth, margin expansion and scaling free cash flow generation. Roku's existing scale is an underappreciated asset as the company has nearly 100mn Active Accounts. The ability to improve monetization of this scale via new partnerships with third-party DSPs will be a key contributor to revenue growth going forward. We expect this to translate to scaling profitability growth and free cash flow generation.
