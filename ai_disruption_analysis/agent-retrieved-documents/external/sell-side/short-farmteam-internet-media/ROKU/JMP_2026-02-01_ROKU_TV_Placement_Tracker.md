Roku January TV Placement Tracker; Roku's Leading Share Remains Intact

· Our monthly tracking of Roku TVs across leading marketplaces reinforces our confidence in the sustainability of Roku's leadership in streaming. Following Walmart's acquisition of Vizio and intensifying competition in the TV operating system (OS) market over the past year, we track the share of Roku TVs featured on the first page of search results for TVs priced under $500 on the websites of Amazon (AMZN, MO, $300 PT, Boone), Walmart (WMT, NC), Best Buy (BBY, NC), and Target (TGT, NC). January data suggest that Roku's share of first-page listings across most marketplaces remained strong as Roku continued to be the top-listed OS on Walmart and Target websites, and maintained its secondary position behind Fire TV on Amazon's own platform. Excluding a two-point decline on Best Buy, Roku's share of first-page listings showed continued strength in January. Notably, Roku gained share at Walmart despite the November introduction of a Vizio-powered onn TV.

Taken together, these trends reinforce our view that Roku is well-positioned to sustain its leadership in the U.S. TV OS market. · We reiterate our Market Outperform rating and $160 price target. With Roku reaching 50%+ of broadband households and capturing 46% of U.S streaming hours in August (per Comscore), we continue to view it as a highly differentiated asset, with its strategic value increasing as streaming consolidation accelerates. Leveraging its leading streaming position, we see multiple growth catalysts over the next several years, including third-party DSP partnerships (notably Amazon), premium subscription growth, continued engagement growth on The Roku Channel, growing adoption of the Roku Ads Manager, and ramping international monetization. In combination with these top-line catalysts, we expect continued cost discipline going forward and we believe $1B+ of FCF is possible over the next several years. As a result, we continue to recommend shares at current levels.

· Roku maintained its leading share of Walmart TV listings in January, with share increasing two points M/M (Figure 1). Roku TVs represented 40% of firstpage listings, up from 38% in December. Within Roku's share of listings, onn-powered Roku TVs accounted for 39% of listings in January, down from 41% in the prior month. Vizio's share of first-page listings increased three points M/M, as we believe Walmart is increasingly leaning into merchandising its TVs as its share of listings has steadily grown over the past several months. Importantly, onn's 43-inch Vizio-powered TV showed up in our tracking this month, which we will continue to track going forward. While the potential impact on Roku's share is still unclear, we are encouraged by Roku's continued leading share.

Price: $95.20 Price Target: $160.00

gains at Target, increasing eight and four points, respectively. We attribute these gains largely to Vizio's fifteen-point decline to 5% in January. While some month-tomonth volatility is expected, we believe Target's assortment changes could be strategic considering Walmart's acquisition of Vizio-we note Target does not carry any Amazon Fire TVs. This said, we will continue to monitor these trends in the coming months.

· In Best Buy, Roku's share eased two points to 8% in January (Figure 4), down from 10% in December. Notably, this follows a period of no listings in October and November, and we view this 8% share as encouraging. Best Buy has historically been the most volatile marketplace in our tracking. · Roku remained the fourth-top-selling TV OS on Amazon in January (Figure 5). Roku accounted for 12% of the top 50 best-selling TVs in January, up from 10% in December, ranking behind Fire TV's 46% share, Samsung's 18% share, and Google TV's 14% share. We view January's two point share gain as encouraging after several months of declining share.

· The Roku Channel continues to take share of U.S. streaming time. According to Nielsen, Roku accounted for 6.3% of total streaming time in December, up ~1.7 points Y/Y (Figure 6). Despite seasonal headwinds from NFL viewership, Roku's share still grew 10 bps M/M. With this in mind, we continue to believe Roku is effectively leveraging its Home Screen and broader UX to drive engagement on The Roku Channel. This is a key component to growing Roku's ad inventory, which we believe Roku is increasingly better able to monetize via its deepening third-party DSP integrations.

· Valuation : Shares of Roku last closed at $95.20, implying shares trade for 16.7x 2027E EBITDA. Our unchanged $160 price target is based on ~30x our 2027E EBITDA of $769M (12.5% margin), representing a premium multiple relative to peers. We justify our premium multiple based on Roku's multiple catalysts that we believe could lead to upside to projections, as well as its growing strategic value as the leading TV OS in the U.S.

Roku is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States by hours streamed. Through Roku's streaming platform, users can access a wide range of entertainment including TV shows, movies, and live TV, over the internet. Roku developed its operating platform, Roku OS, from the ground up for TV streaming. Roku OS powers Roku streaming devices, including its Roku-branded TVs, Roku streaming players, and Roku TV model, which are TVs made and sold by OEM partners that license the Roku OS. Roku has two primary business lines: Platform Revenue and Devices Revenue. Roku generates Platform revenue through the sale of digital advertising, including both direct and programmatic video advertising and M&E promotional spend, as well as streaming services distribution, which includes subscription and transaction revenue shares, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the sale of branded app buttons on remote controls. Roku's sale of devices is a user acquisition channel. Roku generates device revenue through the sales of streaming players, Rokubranded TVs, smart home products and services, audio products and related accessories, as well as through

licensing arrangements with service operators. Roku optimizes the selling price of its devices to increase Active Accounts.

Key Risks: 1) The TV OS market is becoming increasingly competitive following Walmart's acquisition of Vizio; 2) Roku's top competitors include Amazon, Google, and Walmart, who have significant balance sheets to subsidize the cost of their OS with OEM partners; 3) Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target were responsible for 81% of Roku's devices revenue in 2024; 4) consolidation of streaming time to a few providers erodes the value of Roku's platform; 5) M&E advertising spend has been pressured as streaming platforms focus on driving their businesses to profitability.
