✓ Management Meeting Takeaways

DUOL - Meeting with Head of AI Reveals Significant AI Contributions to Product Development and Content Generation We met with DUOL's Head of AI and IR; key takeaways below: The biggest strides Duolingo has made on AI recently has been around using AI for product development, content generation, and real-time interactive features, with continued progress around personalization. DUOL revealed that the prototype for its latest and fastest-growing course, Chess, was created using vibe coding by non-technical employees, which in our view, demonstrates the widespread use of AI coding tools at Duolingo - further validated by ~100% of new code at the company generated by AI today and with real-time interactive features like Video Call powered by GenAI capabilities.

Nearly 100% of new code at Duolingo is AI-generated today: We met with Duolingo's Head of AI, Klinton Bicknell, at the company's NYC office. Mr. Bicknell revealed that nearly 100% of new code at the company is generated by AI today and all new content is AIgenerated as the technology has helped create efficiencies and makes it easier to iterate on this code. While he did note some quality issues arise at times with AI-generated content, this has allowed the company to get more content and lessons out rapidly with the opportunity to iterate and improve upon them. We believe DUOL is striking the right balance here between getting new content out to market quicker while iterating on it, and believe quality will improve over time with advancements in AI models.

Biggest proof point of broad-based usage of AI: non-tech team used vibe coding to create prototype for Chess offering: Duolingo disclosed the prototype for its new Chess course was created by non-technical employees using vibe coding (Cursor) - and impressively, the employees didn't even know how to play chess. We believe AI coding tools (vibe coding tools) are having a significant impact and will continue to have a significant impact on Duolingo's product development. The company is already utilizing AI tools internally across almost all functions, and we believe the technology has the potential to meaningfully benefit the company's innovation and product development.

Seeing larger impact on real-time interactive features than personalization: Since Mr. Bicknell joined Duolingo's AI team seven years ago, the group has done significant work on customer personalization and has broadened out from there. With the advancements in GenAI and LLMs, he noted Duolingo's work around personalization (and using data from users' exercises) hasn't changed dramatically, but it has had a meaningful impact on realtime interactive features like Video Call. This has helped enable the company to release premium subscription tiers like Duolingo Max, which offers Video Call - while the feature comes with additional margin costs, DUOL is able to earn premium pricing for these AIpowered features.

Preliminary 4Q metrics encouraging; however, we believe CFO transition introduces some degree of risk: As we mentioned in our note, we were surprised by the timing of Duolingo's CFO transition announcement. While we expect the transition to be smooth, and note Mr. Skaruppa will serve in the role through February (and remain as an advisor through Nov.), we think the move introduces a degree of risk. The preliminary 4Q metrics

(DAU growth ~30% y/y, bookings at or slightly ahead of the high end of guidance) were encouraging to us, and will be looking for the company to provide healthy targets for 2026. Token dynamics improving along with more intelligent models: Mr. Bicknell noted token costs are impressively falling to the magnitude of ~10x/year for a fixed level of intelligence, but more intelligent models are being released regularly. He believes this dynamic has contributed to the usefulness of AI coding tools increasing dramatically over the course of a year and the company has experienced lower costs using LLMs for Max as well.

AI could be competitive, but Duolingo continues to see meaningful competitive advantages in its platform: Additionally, Mr. Bicknell addressed AI as a potential threat for DUOL. While he believes people can learn languages and other subjects straight from ChatGPT and other AI tools, he believes Duolingo retains its competitive advantages as those channels require significantly more dedication from users. Similar to the way learners can continue to learn about a wide array of topics through textbooks or through online content, this dedication and consistency is necessary in order to do so - and oftentimes, it's difficult to maintain for regular learners vs. DUOL's app, which gamifies learning and creates a habitual experience by making it more fun and engaging for users. Additionally, we think live translation tools can help reduce language barriers in conversations, but don't ultimately help with learning over time; whereas DUOL's real-time features can help reduce barriers to users practicing speaking languages out loud. We continue to view the strong user experience and engagement from DUOL as a defensible competitive advantage

and don't view current AI alternatives as meaningful threats. Footnote: All figures in $M except for EPS Sources: Company reports and Truist Securities estimates "Required Disclosures" are on the last tab of the workbook. Arvind Ramnani Truist Securities Arvind.Ramnani@Truist.com | 214-969-5873

Duolingo, Inc. (DUOL) is a leading education-technology company headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Founded in 2011, the organization is guided by its mission to create high-quality educational experiences and make them accessible to learners globally. Since its inception, Duolingo has grown from a language-learning startup into a prominent, multi-disciplinary digital learning platform serving a diverse international user base.

The company's primary offering is the Duolingo mobile and web application, which provides instruction in a broad array of languages through short, structured, and highly interactive lessons. The platform leverages game design principles, including streaks, rewards, and leveling systems, to increase learner motivation and retention. Over time, Duolingo has strategically expanded the scope of its product ecosystem. In addition to its core language courses, it offers the Duolingo English Test, an online, on-demand English-proficiency exam used by institutions worldwide, as well as learning tools aimed at early readers. A significant development in the company's recent evolution has been its transition toward a multi-subject educational platform. Duolingo has introduced dedicated Math and Music courses into its flagship app, reflecting a broader ambition to extend beyond language learning.

Duolingo operates under a freemium business model, offering its core content at no cost while generating revenue through premium subscription plans that provide an ad-free experience and additional learning features. Additional revenue streams include in-app purchases and fees associated with the Duolingo English Test. The scalability of the platform, combined with a product-led growth strategy, has enabled consistent expansion across both free and paid user segments.

We rate DUOL shares Buy. We view the company's market-leading position and ability to keep users engaged as significant competitive advantages. In our view, Duolingo's ability to gamify learning is a significant differentiator in the education market that has helped attract new users, keep existing users active, and has translated to success even across new courses such as Math, Music, and Chess. We believe Duolingo's strength in engaging users will help it sustain its strong user growth and to better monetize its users over time - with new courses also serving as a significant growth lever that could provide new monetization channels over time. We also continue to see significant runway in Duolingo's core language-learning courses with the company exceeding 100M monthly active users compared to over 2B people globally looking to learn a new lesson. We view AI as a tailwind for the business over the long term, contributing to faster, new content generation based on its users' 1.25B exercises per day, as well as new product development with coding efficiencies using AI coding tools. We also see further room for margin expansion over

time for Duolingo.

Our price target of $245 is based on a 28.0x EV/EBITDA multiple on our FY26 estimates. We believe that our multiple assumption is justified as we expect to see multiple expansion and a return to levels experienced earlier in 2025 driven by DUOL's display of strength in user adds and further adoption of new products (Math, Music and Chess) in the coming quarters. Risks to our rating and price target include competition from AI players, pricing risk from AI models, potential pricing headwinds, and retention/churn.
