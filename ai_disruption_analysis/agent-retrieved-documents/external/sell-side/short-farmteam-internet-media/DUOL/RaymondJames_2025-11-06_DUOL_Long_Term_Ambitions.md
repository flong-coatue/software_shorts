We maintain our Market Perform rating on

DUOL following 3Q25 results that showed broadbased upside in the quarter including DAU growth (+36% y/y) that was likely well ahead of buy side expectations, offset by a softer 4Q25 bookings outlook that reflects the start of a modest strategic pivot towards user growth (vs. near term monetization). While the +22% y/y 4Q25 bookings guide is likely to pressure shares tomorrow, we believe the changes DUOL is embarking on are likely to be more modest financially in the short term relative to the headline number. While the linearity and timeline of its greater focus on learning outcomes creates added uncertainty on the next ~6-12 month set up, it's clear that DUOL's ambitions (getting to 1+ billion users) are far grander than what most likely were underwriting. In the meantime, we still see Duolingo executing against several of its growth initiatives including 1) increased engagement (across Max/Video Call and Chess); 2) profitable growth (+38% incremental EBITDA margin); and 3) a continuous product improvement framework that should enable better user

monetization over the medium term (implied ARPU +7% y/y in 3Q25). While the after hours valuation (25x 2026E EBITDA) creates a more compelling entry point, we wait to get more comfort on the timeline of its growth investments and any positive inflection in user trends. 3Q25 Rundown: Total revenue of $271.7M (+41% y/y) topped our $259.4M estimate with Subscription revenue growing +46% y/y to $229.5M (above our $219.5M model) on growing Max tier mix. Adjusted EBITDA of $80.0M (29.5% margin) also handily beat our $71.4M forecast on better gross margin and lower sales and marketing expenses. FCF of $77.4M came in ahead of our $63.3M estimate, while GAAP net income of $292.2M benefited from the operating beat and the release of a prior valuation allowance (+$222.7M) comparing favorably to consensus of $37.5M.

3Q Proves Out Monetization Strategy, but Pivoting Back to Learning Outcomes in ST: Total bookings of $281.9M (+33% y/y) beat our $270.7M estimate by 4%, with subscription bookings of $240.3M (+36% y/y) driving the upside at $10M above our model. Paid subscribers of 11.5M (+34% y/y) accounted for 9.0% of LTM MAUs. MAUs grew +20% y/y to 135.3M users while DAU also grew +36% y/y to 50.5M users (stable 37% DAU/MAU ratio). Max penetration into the subscriber base expanded by ~100 bp to 9% (implied ~800K users), with Video Call improvements remaining in focus, such as guided, bilingual conversations which we believe could contribute to higher Max conversion and retention. We'd also note Family plans, which historically had higher subscriber retention, increased to 29% of subscribers (vs. 23% exiting 2024).

Tempered 4Q25 Outlook Raise as Focusing on Long-Term: Management raised its total revenue outlook by $14.5M at the midpoint to $1,027.5-1,031.5M (+38% y/y), topping consensus of $1,018.1M on the 3Q beat with the 4Q revenue growth outlook up 100 bp to +31% y/y. The total bookings outlook of $1,151-1,157M (+33% y/y) midpoint came up by $1M, below the $11M of 3Q upside and coming in slightly below consensus $1,156.6M (+22% y/y implied in 4Q25). The $296.9-300.2M adjusted EBITDA outlook (29% margin) compares favorably to consensus of $294.1M, but also increased by slightly less than the $9M 3Q beat.

Analyst Compensation : Research analysts and associates at Raymond James are compensated on a salary and bonus system. Several factors enter into the compensation determination for an analyst, including: i) research quality, ii) team productivity, iii) client feedback, iv) rating accuracy, v) overall revenue and profitability levels of the department and firm (a portion of which is generated by investment banking activities) and vi) compensation levels for comparable research analysts at competing firms. Registration of Non-U.S. Analysts : The analysts listed on the front of this report who are not employees of, or associated with, RJA are not registered/qualified as research analysts under FINRA rules and are not subject to FINRA Rule 2241 restrictions on communications with covered companies, trading securities held by a research analyst account, and obligations related to identifying and managing conflicts of interest.

This global disclosure considers all entities of Raymond James and its affiliates. The jurisdiction where the analyst(s) is registered will determine what is permitted. For example, if the persons responsible for the content of this report are not licensed as research analysts in accordance with applicable rules promulgated by the regulatory organization(s) where this report is distributed, any client wishing to effect trades in any security should contact their Raymond James representative. The analysts Alexander Sklar and Brian Peterson, primarily responsible for the preparation of this research report, attest to the following: (1) that the views and opinions rendered in this research report reflect his or her personal views about the subject companies or issuers and (2) that no part of the research analyst's compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views in this research report.

We use a combination of EV/Revenue, EV/Gross Profit, EV/EBITDA, and EV/FCF multiples relative to peer group of high growth vertical Internet leaders, along with DCF support.

Following are some general risk factors that pertain to the businesses of the subject companies and the projected target prices and recommendations included on Raymond James research: (1) Industry fundamentals with respect to customer demand or product/service pricing could change and adversely impact expected revenues and earnings; (2) issues relating to major competitors or market shares or new product expectations could change investor attitude toward the sector or this stock; (3) Unforeseen developments with respect to the management, financial condition or accounting policies or practices could alter the prospective valuation.

Competition. The company faces competition from a wide range of competitors, including both online and offline learning providers. There are thousands of companies that provide supplemental instruction and learning services offline, ranging from individual tutors to larger businesses such as Kumon and Kaplan. Furthermore, there is significant online competition. We expect online competition to continue to grow given the attractiveness of the category. Customer Acquisition. Attracting new Learners is key to Duolingo's long-term success. To date, Duolingo has relied on organic marketing and word of mouth and has been able to acquire customers in an efficient manner. However, going forward, attracting new users could become more difficult or the cost of attracting new users could increase, which would likely impact profitability. Consumer Acceptance. Duolingo's business depends greatly on the adoption by new users of digital language learning. While Duolingo has seen significant growth in users who have adopted digital learning, there is no guarantee that learners will continue to shift their learning online going forward.

Paid Subscription. Duolingo has continued to increase the conversion of its users to paid subscribers. A key part of the long-term revenue growth is based on continued increases in conversion rates. Should conversion rates not increase as much as expected, growth and profitability would likely be impacted.

Moderate Risk/Provide Income (M/INC) Larger capitalization, lower volatility (beta) equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings, and dividend yields meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. Many securities in this category are structured with a focus on providing a consistent dividend or return of capital. Moderate Risk/Wealth Accumulation (M/ACC) Larger capitalization equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings growth, the potential for long-term price appreciation, and often a dividend yield. Moderately Aggressive Risk/ Provide Income (MA/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a dividend meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. These companies typically feature sound financials, positive earnings, and the potential for long-term price appreciation. Moderately Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (MA/ACC) Generally equities of companies in fast growing and competitive industries with less predictable earnings (or losses), potentially more

leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, and potential risk of principal. Aggressive Risk/Provide Income (A/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a meaningful dividend but may face less predictable earnings (or losses), more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, financial and competitive issues, higher price volatility (beta), and meaningful risk of loss of principal.
