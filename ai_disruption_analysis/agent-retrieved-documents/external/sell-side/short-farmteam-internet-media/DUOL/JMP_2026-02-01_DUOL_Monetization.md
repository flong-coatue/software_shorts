2026 May Be the Year Duolingo Monetizes Its Scaled & Highly Engaged User Base Through Native Ads

· Duolingo in October 2025 announced its character-led ads that promote sponsors' products, which we believe are now ramping. This ad format allows Duolingo characters, such as Oscar, Lily, Falstaff (the bear), and others (though our understanding is that Duo is not available) to offer 15-second sponsored messages with a call to action button (see below). Given the success of native ad placement and influencers, we expect this ad to be highly performant, while early testing was positive, with 96% video completion rates and up to 30% click-through rates. While advertising is just 8% of Duolingo's revenue, better monetization of free users is a significant potential lever for revenue growth, while ad revenue per MAU grew 25% Y/Y and 22% Y/Y in 2Q25 and 3Q25, respectively, yet we estimate ads will generate just $1.65 per DAU or $0.61 per MAU in 2025, which is well below peers. While we continue to worry about Duolingo's user growth, which keeps us at Market Perform, we believe the company has multiple levers to sustain bookings,

revenue, and EBITDA growth as advertising appears to be ramping in 2026. · Duolingo is building out its native ad business. Andrew Aviza posted on LinkedIn that he is moving from Snap (SNAP, MP) to Duolingo "to build out its native advertising business." To that end, it appears that Duolingo is maturing its ad business sales and go-to-market execution given the success of early testing. Early brand partners included Adobe (ADBE, MP, Walravens), Intrepid Travel, Universal Pictures, Hulu, Marriott Hotels, and T-Mobile, with each project including a writer and designer from Duolingo. Andrew Guendjoian, head of ad sales, stated in a December LinkedIn post that four out of Duolingo's six alpha partners renewed, with a fifth partner increasing its investment. Below is an example seen in the wild that we are copying from a Reddit post.

timothy.juang@citizensbank.com (415) 835-3912 Figure 1 - Example of a Native Duolingo Ad Seen by a Reddit User Source: Reddit - · Native ads can help Duolingo track closer to peers. We believe Duolingo has long prioritized its ad impression placements to convert users to subscribers, and we expect this strategy to continue, but the company monetizes well below peers, despite a scaled and highly engaged user base. To that end, we believe there is room to improve ad monetization through Rewarded Video ads (potentially to unlock video calls and other AI features) and better monetization of ads on a per-impression basis. Quantifying the opportunity, if Duolingo reached Grindr's (GRND, MO, $21 PT) ad monetization per MAU of $4.69, Duolingo's ad revenue on its 2025 MAU would be $623M (vs. our 2025E estimate of $82M) and given the high contribution margin from

advertising revenue, we assume this is an ~60% contribution margin or that it adds $325M of EBITDA (vs. 2025E consensus EBITDA of $299M). Figure 2 - Estimated 2025 Revenue Per MAU: Mature Platforms Monetize Better Than Duolingo For Unity, we assume 1.3B MAU (per its website) and a 30% take rate.

· Duolingo's character ads are an example of AI improving Duolingo. AI is an opportunity and a threat for nearly all of our coverage universe as it is helping Duolingo accelerate the creation of content but is also negating the need to learn a language with real-time translation. Additionally, we note AI-first, language-tutoring app Speak crossed $100M of ARR at the end of 2025 as the transition to AI is creating new competitors. Bringing this back to character ads, we believe this would be impossible without AI accelerating ad creative production, and while we believe this is still a direct buy/custom ad product, AI creates the ability for character-led ads to scale over time. For example, TikTok Symphony, which uses AI to generate ad creative with a licensed creator's voice and image, is an example of how others have used technology to scale a similar ad product as character-led ads could become self-service over time.

· Duolingo last closed at $134.06, which implies shares trade for 11.0x our 2027E EBITDA of $507M, a premium to peers. While we are positive on the potential for better ad monetization on the platform, we are most focused on user growth, and we await greater confidence that Duolingo can accelerate user growth before becoming more positive on shares. We maintain our Market Perform rating and see the risk/reward as balanced.

Duolingo is an app-first language learning platform offering courses in 40+ languages through a freemium and gamified go-to-market approach. Duolingo's flagship language learning app has been downloaded 500+ million times with 500+ million exercises completed on the platform daily. Duolingo monetizes its users through subscriptions, advertising, in-app purchases, and offers online English proficiency exams through its Duolingo English Test (DET) product. The company was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with offices in New York, Seattle, and Beijing.

Risks to investing in Duolingo include, but are not limited to: 1) Retention and churn as many users lose motivation to learn a new language shortly after starting; 2) competition within the language learning market is intense; 3) Duolingo English Test is dependent on acceptance from higher education institutions and governments; 4) given the platform's app-first nature, margins are subject to changes in app store fees.
