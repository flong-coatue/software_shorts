Take-Two is a top-tier operator in the global video game market with the best long-term track record in its peer group. Expected catalysts include the release of GTA VI in November 2026, as well a pipeline of other titles . Ongoing strong performance from mobile and NBA 2K is also an important value driver. Reiterate Buy (1).

We have long been constructive on Take-Two's successful track record of growth driven by its development talent, intellectual property, and strong management. Take-Two remains a highquality vehicle to invest in what we expect to be above-GDP growth (at high returns on capital) for the video gaming industry over the next decade. We believe that the ceiling on potential GTA VI performance, particularly the online portion, is very high.

One of the most dominant trends in the AAA gaming industry for the last decade+ has been the tendency of the biggest franchises to get bigger. In our recently published part 2 of our video game primer, we showed that the market share of the largest titles is roughly 3x what it was 20 years ago. We expect that trend to continue over the next decade and we expect GTA to be a significant beneficiary - perhaps the most significant beneficiary - of that trend.

GTA VI is the most potent catalyst across our coverage space, with management reiterating its expectation for record net bookings growth in FY27. We expect the title to sell 40MM+ units in its first 12 months, but also expect the live service portion of the game to drive a significant step-up from GTA Online's current ~$500MM annual bookings contribution, with our current estimate at $3B in FY28.

Our $284 price target is based on 19.0x our FY28E EBITDA. We believe video game stocks generally deserve a premium to the overall market due to better long-term growth potential, attractive margins at scale, and high barriers to entry. We also note that soon TTWO will likely (assuming the EA transaction is completed) be the only scaled, public, third-party video game publisher, which we think warrants a scarcity premium.

Risks to our call include (1) GTA VI gets delayed again (again), (2) mobile game or NBA 2K spending deteriorates, and (3) unanticipated macro or FX headwinds.

We believe Take-Two has strong intellectual property and development talent, and we generally think it is positioned well in both the AAA and mobile game markets. The upcoming launch of GTA VI has the potential to fundamentally change the earnings power of the company. We believe that TTWO remains a high-quality vehicle to play continued strong underlying trends in the video game industry.

■ New release announcements for FY26+ ■ Next GTA VI trailer, GTA VI release ■ Specific guidance for FY27+

■ NBA 2K or mobile starts declining meaningfully ■ RCS fails to grow in FY26/FY27 ■ No new GTA until FY28+ ■ EBIT margins stay below 20% due to title underperformance and high costs

We reiterate our Buy rating on Take-Two (market cap: $44B) and present it as our contribution to TD Cowen's 'Best Ideas' series for the fourth year in a row. Our price target is $284 (19x FY28E EBITDA); our target multiple reflects our view that the upside potential from 'GTA Online 2' (or whatever it winds up being called) is substantial but not easily quantifiable. Take-Two has strong intellectual property and development talent, and we generally think it is positioned well in both the AAA game market and the mobile market. We believe Take-Two remains a high-quality vehicle to play a strong long-term video game industry outlook. Valuation remains attractive, while current levels offer an attractive buying opportunity. Key investment points include:

1. The recent GTA VI delay to November 2026 could potentially be due to the technical undertaking of an unprecedented live service portion of the game. As the first full new installment in the GTA franchise since 2013, GTA VI is a substantial (if obvious) potential catalyst. Based on record-setting views of the first and second trailers (nearly 100MM in the first 24 hours for the first, surpassed with over 475MM in 24 hours by the second), it's clear that audience interest in the game is intense. While we expect the game to sell tens of millions of units in its launch year, we think the potential for greatly expanded franchise live service bookings is the most compelling piece of the investment case for TTWO shares. We estimate that GTAO currently generates close to $500MM in annual bookings; however, we note that CoD and EA Sports FC ( GTA's closest comps in terms of breadth of audience) generate in the range of $2.5B-$3.0B in annual revenue . We don't think there is any structural reason why an all

-new GTA live service can't reach or exceed those levels. In particular, we think the potential for the next GTAO to include a user-generated content (UGC) economy could significantly raise the ceiling on potential bookings performance. 2. 2025 had some key AAA releases, and we expect several more in 2026-27. Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country released in FY26. Other upcoming titles that are likely in FY27-FY28 include (at least) Judas, a Bioshock sequel, and Project Ethos . We expect most if not all of these titles will launch over the next couple of years, which should contribute to overall growth. We also note that after a few years of stagnation, NBA 2K has returned to a growth trajectory.

3. TakeTwo's mobile business is outperforming the broader industry. TakeTwo's two biggest mobile titles, Match Factory and Toon Blast , continue to be on a double-digit% growth trajectory, and the Rollic studio has turned out a steady stream of hit titles for the last two+ years. Additionally, there are signs that the mobile advertising business is stabilizing after two+ years of declining performance. It's important to remember that, even after GTA VI launches (and with our high expectations), we still expect mobile and NBA 2K to collectively account for ~50% of bookings in FY28.

4. We believe the stock remains reasonably priced given the potential for material upside from GTA VI . TTWO trades at 21.8x our FY28 EPS estimate, just a touch above the CY27 S&P 500 multiple of 19.1x. This presents an attractive opportunity to buy into a best-in-class (and indeed, heading towards only-inclass) independent game publisher before the frenzy around the GTA VI release. We generally think that video game stocks should trade at a premium to the overall market given (1) above-GDP top line growth prospects, (2) strong margins at scale, (3) high FCF conversion, (4) excellent ROIC profiles, (5) high barriers to market entry, (6) low risk of disintermediation, (7) the increasing value of video game IP in other media verticals, and (8) a relative scarcity of quality independent video game assets.

In most conversations with investors around TTWO, we get the question "so how many units do you think GTA VI will sell?". Our answer is invariably " well we've got 40MM in FY27 and another 20MM in FY28, but that isn't the important question; the important question is how much live service revenue will the game generate in FY28?". FY28 is the important year because (a) it represents a full year of results, (b) it speaks to sustainability, and (c) there will be an enormous amount of capitalized development cost amortization coming off the balance sheet in FY27; FY28 is a better read on normalized EPS power postGTA VI . (Note that we do expect that a fullyfeatured GTA VI live service will absolutely launch day and date with the single player campaign; any other approach would be malpractice, in our view, given the importance of scaling a robust player community.) We start by framing the opportunity with the following observations:

1) We estimate EA Sports FC currently generates ~$1.8B in annual live service revenue, plus another ~$1.0B from selling an updated version of the game every year, for ~$2.8B in annual 'recurrent' revenue. We include annual game sales for FC because, for the most part, unit sales are driven by spending by repeat customers, whereas GTA VI unit purchases in FY28 and beyond will largely be from new customers. 2) Similarly, we think Call of Duty is at around ~$1.5B in annual live service revenue, plus another ~$1.0B from selling an updated version of the game every year (same logic as FC ), for ~$2.5B in annual 'recurrent' revenue (or at least, it was before Microsoft started running the show and added it to Game Pass). 3) We think Fortnite is somewhere north of $3B in annual live service revenue as a F2P title.

Now, we would say GTA is every bit as big of a franchise as any of those other three titles, but for the last five years, we estimate GTA Online has averaged around $500MM/year in bookings, far short of the ~$3Bish generated by FC/CoD/Fortnite . We attribute this to GTAO being a 12-year old live service that, while it has received many updates, was not structurally created with all the live service learnings of the last decade built in. While there is no guarantee that GTA Online 2 (or whatever it ends up being called) will grow substantially vs. the current GTAO, we think the company and Rockstar would view it as a major failure if GTA didn't become at least a $1B/year live service title, and Rockstar's ambitions are undoubtedly significantly higher.

Our FY28 live service bookings estimate for GTA VI is $3.02B. Obviously this is a big number (probably Street-high, we'd guess); but we do think it is a completely plausible outcome given the comps we outlined above and our belief that with GTA VI, Rockstar is going to create something truly great.

It is also our observation that the big franchises keep getting bigger in video games; it's been a while in the AAA space since we have had a title redefine the ceiling for 'big' ( Fortnite back in 2018-19), and we think GTA VI could establish a new threshold for what a live service title can reasonably earn. Therefore, while our ~$3B annual live service revenue is certainly well into bull case scenario territory, we don't think it is an uber-bull case scenario. Moreover, our view doesn't necessarily assume that GTA VI includes a major user generated content feature set/marketplace, which as we have said in the past, we think is possible. Roblox is currently operating at about an $8B annual bookings runrate with such a model … at this point we are talking about super-uber-bull case scenarios, but we're not ruling it out, particularly with Rockstar at the tiller. More than ever (with the recent declines of some other outfits like Blizzard and Bungie), Rockstar is the ne plus ultra of AAA video game

design.

Lastly, we think it makes sense to look at what the historical trading patterns have been before and after prior Rockstar releases. Below is the data for TTWO share performance relative to the average performance of ATVI & EA for the year before and the year after major Rockstar releases. There is a bit of a lack of data here; there have only been seven GTA and RDR releases in the last 25 years, and in some cases the data is confounded -GTA III and Vice City launched within a year of each other, and the launch of GTA IV was bookended by an attempted and then abandoned acquisition by EA, which distorts the share performance data pretty significantly. Excluding those three titles, there is some evidence for relative outperformance in the quarter leading up to a major Rockstar release (+11% average) and some evidence for relative underperformance in the quarter after a major Rockstar release (-12% average) -essentially, a bit of a run-up into the launch that almost exactly reverses post-launch, but given the s mall number of data points, we're not sure

there's much that is actionable here.

In our view, the overall core gaming market is showing robust signs of health that bode well for 2027. We expect overall console software/services sales to accelerate to +8% y/y in 2026 on a constant currency basis. We expect software/services sales will grow +MSD% y/y on the PlayStation/Xbox consoles, with the YTD figure at +5%, including +2% y/y growth in Q3 (the release comps in Q4 are on the easier side). We expect console software/services growth to settle around +6% CC y/y in 2027. November 25, 2025

Take-Two management expressed continued confidence in the progress being made on the content pipeline besides GTA VI , with 21 'immersive core' titles slated between FY26 and FY28. FY26 guidance reflects four of these titles, three of which have already launched: Mafia: The Old Country , NBA 2K , and Borderlands 4 and their other annual sports title WWE 2K26 set to launch in Q4:F25. We expect several other significant franchise titles beyond FY26. All of these titles have the pedigree to be meaningful additive contributors to earnings, both in the release year, and as live service titles post-launch. These include the following (all of which have been confirmed to be in development):

▪ TakeTwo's Ghost Story studio announced Judas roughly three years ago. Ghost Story is run by Ken Levine, who also led development on the original Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite. Official release date remains TBA. ▪ Project Ethos, which was officially revealed last October as the title of the game in development from 31 st Union studio, now headed by Ben Brinkman (who previously was an executive director on both Call of Duty and Apex Legends ). Our current expectations are somewhat muted as early feedback on the game was lukewarm, and it remains difficult to launch new IP titles in the current market.

▪ A new Bioshock title. The three franchise releases had sold over 43MM units lifeto-date, including 11MM for the most recent release, Bioshock Infinite (2013). The franchise has averaged a 93 Metacritic score to-date. Earlier this year, industry veteran Rod Fergusson ( Diablo IV, Gears of War ) returned to 2K (he had previously helped shepherd Bioshock Infinite to completion) to head the next iteration of the franchise. Fergusson has a strong industry reputation as a 'closer', and we think the franchise is in good hands. Clearly there are other core titles in the pipeline beyond the above and the annual NBA 2K/WWE 2K titles, but we think these are probably the most important shots on goal (we suspect a new game in Rockstar's other big franchise, Red Dead Redemption , is probably still a long way out).

The mobile gaming market will finish 2025 with its third straight year of growth. Our projections assume Q4:25 daily U.S. mobile consumer spending will be up less than +1% q/q but grow +8% y/y, helped by relatively easy comps and consistent with historical patterns. We expect CY25 U.S. mobile market growth of +3.3% y/y, including 7% growth in 2H against more normalized comps (we believe 1H:C24 was peak Monopoly Go performance).

TakeTwo's mobile portfolio has recently performed exceptionally well, posting DD% y/y in-game bookings growth in six of the last seven quarters. Advertising had been an offsetting drag until recently, with that part of the business growing in Q2:F26 for the first time in two years. Growth has been led by Peak's 1-2 punch of Toon Blast and Match Factory, the two largest games in the portfolio, with both enjoying strong double-digit y/y growth for several consecutive quarters. They are the two largest games in Take-Two's mobile portfolio, with both accounting for an estimated ~15% of total mobile bookings. The Rollic studio has also seen significant success of late, with Color Block Jam getting to north of a $200MM annual run-rate in both of the first two quarters of the FY (by our estimates). While that game is starting to cool off, Rollic currently has four other recent mobile releases that we believe are delivering at least $35MM-$40MM annual run-rates ( Hole People, Knit

Out, Gecko Out, and Drop Away ) Rollic's titles tend to burn hot for a quarter or two and then fade, but they have successfully iterated new hits on a regular basis, and the scale of their hits has been increasing, with Color Block Jam being their largest yet.

On the last earnings call, Take-Two management guided FQ3 to bookings of $1.55B$1.60B and EPS $0.90 at the midpoint. This was a significant increase against prior guidance due to continued robust performance from mobile and NBA 2K. Our revenue estimate of $1.59B is at the high-end of the guidance range and in-line with consensus. Our EPS estimate of $0.83 is below the guidance midpoint of $0.90 and slightly above consensus of $0.82.

We note that current FQ3 guidance assumes (1) +LDD% y/y growth for mobile and (2) +MSD% y/y growth for NBA 2K. The mobile guidance suggests a L-MSD% q/q decline; our checks suggest that so far, in-game mobile spending is trending close to flat q/q. For NBA 2K, MSD% growth would be a major slowdown vs. the 40%+ y/y RCS growth the game has enjoyed over the last three quarters. While FQ3 does have more challenging comps than FQ2, assuming the two-year growth rate remains consistent suggests NBA 2K growth could be in the LDD%-teens% range. Thus, we tend to think there could be another guidance raise on the FQ3 call in February.

Our valuation methodology is primarily based on an ex-cash price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, where for earnings we use after-tax non-GAAP operating income (to remove interest earnings along with cash). We also use a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to support our valuation targets. We make investment recommendations on certain early stage, pre-revenue companies based upon an assessment of their business model, technology, probability of market success, and the potential market opportunity, balanced by an assessment of applicable risks. Such companies may not be assigned a price target. (1)The global macroeconomic environment worsens, impacting consumer discretionary spending on video games. (2) Availability of other entertainment options decreases time spent playing video games. (3) New government regulations impact the distribution of video games featuring mature-themed content. (4) New entrants into video game publishing disrupt the existing value chain, resulting in reduced revenues and/or compressed margins for our companies under coverage. (5) New technologies such as virtual reality increase R&D costs without yielding revenue growth.

Risks for Take-Two include: (1) The company's games may fail to find acceptance among the target audience. (2) The company's most profitable franchise, 'Grand Theft Auto', is published infrequently, leading to large swings in annual earnings performance. (3) Key talent involved in the production of the company's major titles could leave the company. (4) The company could miss release dates for key titles, leading to financial underperformance. (5) Key annuity revenue sources such as GTA Online and NBA 2K could see declines in performance. (6) The company could pursue value-destroying acquisitions.
