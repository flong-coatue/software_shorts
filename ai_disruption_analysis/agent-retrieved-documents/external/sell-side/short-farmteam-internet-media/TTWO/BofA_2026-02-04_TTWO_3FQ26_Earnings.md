Price objective basis & risk Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) Our price objective of $295 is based on 26x the average of FY27E & FY28E EPS estimates, which is indicative of the sustainable earnings power post GTA 6 launch. Our target P/E multiple is above the average P/E valuation of diversified game publishers, justified by higher earnings growth potential & FCF generation after the launch of GTA 6. Upside risks to our price objective are: (1) a gameplay trailer by Rockstar that drives retail frenzy, (2) media hype cycle drives institutional FOMO-driven momentum rally. Downside risks to our price objective emanate mainly from a delay of GTA VI launch beyond FY26, re-degradation of mobile game performance, and the lack of new games launching, when we expect them to and in the revenue level we expect, as indicated in our research.

Take-Two Interactive AI-driven selloff creates enhanced buying opportunity TTWO now offers a particularly attractive buying opportunity after the recent drawdown on concern s that Google ' s " Genie 3 " model undermines AAA publishers. We view the concerns as misplaced: (1) mgmt clarified that Genie " is not a game engine " and today looks closer to a procedurally generated interactive video tool than a replacement for mission design, physics, networking or live-ops ; it cannot supplant end ‑ to ‑ end game production , (2) about half of TTWO ' s earnings are gated by proprietary IP and licenses (e.g., NBA/NBPA, player likeness rights), and the company ' s hallmark open ‑ world titles deliver ~ 100 hours of authored gameplay and stable multiplayer environments at scale. L arge 3FQ beat reflects durable fundamentals Net Bookings of $1.76B beat guidance by ~11% (vs. ~$1.55 - $1.60B) ; results surprised BofA/Street, and likely buyside as well

. The composition of the beat was arguably more important: NBA 2K grew +30% YoY, GTA Online rose +27%, and Mobile advanced +19%, driving RCS +23% (vs. +8% guide) - evidence of operational improvements . NBA 2K ' s momentum looks durable given the League ' s international expansion efforts . NBA 2K ' s growth is all the more notable in light of the PC/Console Video Game industry ' s stagnant 4-6% growth rate. TTWO ' s DTC channel delivered its strongest quarter on record . 4FQ26 guide conservative ; GTA 6 marketing affirmed Mgmt raised FY26 Net Bookings by $200mn at the high end, effectively passing through the 3Q upside. We model 4Q at the high end of guidance with upside risk and lift our FY27/FY28 E EPS by $0.37/$0.61 to $11.91/$10.76, reflecting more persistent strength in NBA 2K; notably, NBA 2K ' s re ‑ acceleration could give out ‑ year EPS a sizeable tailwind; we estimate $4

- $5 of FY28 E EPS contribution within our $10.76 model. Moreover, m gmt confirmed GTA VI marketing kicks off this summer, reducing the risk of another delay. Reiterate Buy rating ; maintain PO We reiterate Buy & $295 PO , based on 2 6 x $11.34 EPS, which is the average of FY27 E & FY28 E EPS of $ 11. 91 & $10.76 (vs 26x FY27E EPS before) . We view the average EPS of FY27 E & FY28 E as a better reflection of sustainable earnings power given the timing of the PC/Console pipeline remains largely unknown.

We rate TTWO Buy. TTWO is rolling out one of the largest PC/Console game pipelines in the history of video games. Its games each have 10s of millions of fans, and sales span multiple console generations, PC, and with the addition of Zynga (acquired in May 2022) potentially mobile phones. While the widely anticipated GTA 6 release should support multiple years of above market earnings growth & cash flow generation, a potential delay in the game's launch could be a minor headwind in the near term.
