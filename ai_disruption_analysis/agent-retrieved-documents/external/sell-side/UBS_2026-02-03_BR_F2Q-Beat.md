Relative to our forecast, the company reported higher revenue and higher adjusted expenses, driving a higher adj. operating margin (15.5% vs 14.1% UBSe). The revenue beat to UBSe was mostly in distributution revenue and event-driven revenues, but recurring revenues were also much better. Total recurring revenue increased 8% y/y (constant currency) in the F2Q, flat compared to the last quarter and above guidance of 'higher end' of the 5-7% range for FY26, which was reaffirmed. Closed sales of $57mm increased 24% y/y, and guidance for closed sales in fiscal 2026 was maintained at $290330mm. On the other hand, guidance for EPS growth was tightened at the low end to 9-12% y/y, from 8-12% y/y previously. We think the 2Q beat and higher EPS growth guidance should bode well for the shares today.

 Total revenue of $1,714mm beat UBSe by 5% and increased 8% y/y.  Total recurring revenue of $1,070mm beat UBSe by 2% and increased 9% y/y. Event-driven revenue of $91mm beat UBSe by 37% but decreased 27% y/y. Distribution revenue of $553mm beat UBSe by 8% and increased 14% y/y.  Within the ICS segment, regulatory revenue of $249mm beat UBSe by 9% and rose 18% y/y, fund solutions revenue of $113mm missed UBSe by 5% and decreased 2% y/y, Issuer revenue of $39mm beat UBSe by 3% and rose 8% y/y and communications revenue of $189mm missed UBSe by 2% but increased 6% y/y.  Capital Markets revenue of $301mm beat UBSe by 3% and rose 8% y/y. Wealth revenue of $180mm beat UBSe by 2% and increased 12% y/y, partially due to the SIS acquisition.

Adjusted expenses of $1,449mm were 4% higher than we expected and increased 9% y/y partly due to the inclusion of SIS. The adjusted operating margin of 15.5% (vs. 14.1% UBSe) contracted 110bps y/y. Guidance for FY26 adj operating margin of 2021% was maintained.

Our price target is based on a 25x multiple on our CY26E EPS estimate of $9.90.
