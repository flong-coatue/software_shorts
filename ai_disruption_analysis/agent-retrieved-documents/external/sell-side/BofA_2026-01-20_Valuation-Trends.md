Price objective basis & risk AerCap Holdings N.V. (AER) We derive our PO of $150 using a 1.3x P/TBV multiple on 2026 estimates excluding goodwill but not premium assets and maintenance rights. Our 1.3x multiple compares to 0.3-1.8x of last ten-year range. We think this multiple is justified given the underlying value of AER's existing portfolio (including highly profitable older planes, engines, and ample range to continue to sell aircraft at a gain) as well as opportunistic capital deployment. Downside risks to our PO are global economic weakness, fuel price spikes, inability to access capital markets at attractive terms, terrorism and geopolitical events, a downturn in aircraft values resulting from rising supply, flattening yield curve, a sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar, changes in equity risk premiums, overall stock market and financial company valuations, and actual value of GECAS assets is lower than expected.

Upside risks to our PO are higher-than-forecast aircraft trading gains, faster-than-expected recovery in air traffic and commercial air travel, higher lease rates, stronger-than-expected economic growth, continued weakness in fuel prices, U.S. dollar depreciation, easier access to credit at attractive rates, and higher-than-expected unlocked value from GECAS assets. AeroVironment (AVAV) Our PO of $450 is derived from an 10x EV/Sales multiple on CY2026E. The 10x EV/Sales growth represents a 0.6x EV/Sales/Growth multiple in line with the peer average and above Defense Primes. We see the premium to traditional defense primes as fair given strong growth opportunities in emerging fields and investor appetite for "defense tech" exposure. Upside risks to our PO are higher than expected growth in defense spending, increased investment in drone programs, continued NATO funding growth and interest, and further strategic M&A.

Downside risks to our PO are increased commercial competition, poor award activity in international markets, diminished funding for drone programs, and integration challenges stemming from the BlueHalo acquisition. Albany International (AIN) Our PO of $55 is based on a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation reflecting a 7x 2026E EV/EBITDA multiple on Machine Clothing and a 10x multiple on AEC. In our view, a 7x multiple for MC accounts for upcoming challenges at the business while still providing a slight premium to the company's paper/packaging and machining peer group as well as future Heimbach contributions. We also see a 10x multiple for AEC as fairly reflecting potential headwinds in comml and defense.

Downside risks to our price objective are as follows: the Machine Clothing segment is AIN's primary driver of cash. Global slowdown in paper production and/or disruption in the production of paper could hurt AIN's profits and cash profile. A disruption in cash generation in Machine Clothing could hinder management's ability to invest in aerospace and defense. A commercial aerospace downturn that affects narrowbody aircraft that have the CFM Leap engine could materially affect Albany. Unexpected cancellations to programs in both commercial and military could materially impact AIN. Uncertainty around leadership. Upside risks to our PO are as follows: if the Airbus A320neo, Boeing 737 MAX and Comac C919 announced production rates are increased, AIN would benefit as a sole sourced supplier to the CFM LEAP engine and could provide upside to our estimates. Increased scope of work on existing programs and/or new program wins could provide upside in the medium term. Axon Enterprise Inc (AXON)

We derive our valuation of $805 using an EV/Sales 18x multiple on 2026E revenue, which would value Axon at a slight premium to software peers. We view the valuation ahead of peers as fair given Axon's business model is unique in providing for both safety hardware and software, which leverages its multi-tiered subscription model. Downside risks to our PO are a downturn in overall security/safety spending from local, state, and federal governments which could negatively impact growth opportunities. Additionally, the legal landscape for police surveillance is evolving and could negatively impact Axon's international addressable markets. Upside risks to our PO are greater adoption of more expensive subscription tiers from their existing customers. Quicker adoption of Axon's Software & Sensor products in international and federal markets. Additionally, we see upside potential from acquisition targets contributing to earnings as well as potentially increasing Axon's addressable market. BETA Technologies (BETA)

Our PO of $37 is based on a long term DCF of Base, Bull, and Bear scenarios for both revenue and cash generation between 2025E and 2035E. Given BETA is a company expected to generate negative EPS and free cash flow, we view a long-term cash flow analysis as the best way to value the equity. Our DCF factors in a 14% discount rate and assigns a 33% weighting to the Base case (5% terminal growth rate (TGR)), 33% weighting to the Bull case (7% TGR), and 33% weighting to the Bear case (3% TGR). We employ a lower discount rate relative to peers (15%-20%) to account for the company's mature phase in aircraft development milestones and technologies. In our view, the equal weighting fairly reflects current investor risk appetite, momentum for new technology A&D stocks, and the perceived viability of BETA's business model compared to peers.

Upside risks: FAA certifying the CX300 and A250 ahead of the anticipated late 2026/ early 2027 and late 2027 / early 2028 timelines, respectively. BETA developing their military variant ahead of schedule. Significant funding increases to eVTOL infrastructure and demand. Lower-than-expected losses and cash burn. Downside risks: If the FAA certification is delayed significantly for either platform, or potentially never at all. eVTOL / UAM market not growing meaningfully over the next decade. Supply chain / production delays during BETA's production ramp phase. Any major safety lapses or accidents involving any electric aircraft / eVTOL manufacturer Boeing (BA) Our $270 PO is based on normalized FCF of $10/share and relative value to the S&P 500 of 1.0x (1 standard deviations above historical average). In our view, a premium to the market fairly reflects the strong demand for commercial jets and F-47 ramp-up.

Upside risks are the possible involvement of an activist shareholder, better-than-expected cash margins at 787 and/or MAX programs, the company's ability to sustain 777 delivery rates through the bridge to 777X, lower-than-expected 777X, future single-aisle and middle-of-the-market aircraft development costs, F/A-XX potential win.

Downside risks: Tight competition for talent in the labor market could make new product development more challenging. Execution risk on new programs and production ramp-ups (737MAX, 777X, KC-46) could result in cost overruns and margin contractions. Changes in trade policy that end in a trade war. A sharp and prolonged surge in oil prices to above $100/barrel would be negative to aircraft demand. A downturn in commercial aviation, due to an exogenous factor, could adversely affect financial results. As aircraft are priced in USD, an unexpected rapid revaluation in the dollar could significantly affect order activity. Also, a strong dollar could improve EU competitor's advantage. 787 fixes could take longer than expected. Reputation risk stemming from recent incidents could result in fewer incremental orders. Asset sales that may not materialize. F-47 execution could be a challenge. Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH)

Our PO of $90 is based on a 0.8x relative EV/EBITDA multiple to the defense primes, at the lower end of the 0.8x-1.4x historical range. This reflects a 12x EV/EBITDA multiple. We think a relative multiple at the lower end of the historical range fairly reflects the downward pressure from Civil exposure and delayed accelerations in Defense We think valuation will remain pressured until BAH can return to a net growth trajectory. Risks to the upside are a better-than-anticipated upturn in the federal budget, faster-than-expected normalization from post-DOGE environment, inexpensive and well-integrated M&A activity and unexpected capital return to shareholders in the form of buybacks or special dividends. Risks to the downside are cuts to the DoD budget vs. anticipated, unfavorable timing between DOGE-related cuts and the bridge to new tech-oriented solutions. Should BAH run into any problems with integrating M&A, containing its costs or a heightened competitive environment there could be downside risk to our estimates.

BWX Technologies, Inc. (BWXT) Our PO of $230 is based on 33x EV/EBITDA multiple on 2026 estimates. This implies a 2.2x relative multiple on the defense primes' 15x weighted average multiple, above historical average. The premium to defense primes is supported by the company's exposure to the US Navy, its monopoly on nuclear powered ships, the inflection of the medical business, and the company's diversification into adjacent markets. Downside risks to our PO are losing US government contracts, changes in contracting terms that could pressure margins, and program procurement changes that result in market share loss. The US government is BWXT's largest customer and drives the majority of BWXT's revenues. Overly optimistic company outlook. Upside risks to our PO are additional upside from the AUKUS trilateral agreement, better than expected operating performance and margins, and increased demand for nuclear aftermarket for powerplants. Additionally, acquisitions could provide upside to our estimates. CACI International (CACI)

Our PO of $670 is based on a relative EV/EBITDA multiple in line with the defense primes on CY26 estimates. This equals a 16x EV/EBITDA. We think CACI is well positioned to long-term DoD and intelligence priorities. We see continued execution and margin expansion bolstering valuation, with opportunities for upside from strategic M&A to gain market share in growing areas of importance (such as electronic warfare, signals intelligence & radio-frequency tech). Downside risks are cuts to the DoD budget vs. anticipated, problems finding acquisition targets, integrating M&A, hiring the right personnel, containing its costs, estimating costs and executing on fixed price contracts, sustaining reputational risk and future awards. Upside risks are a better than anticipated federal budget allocated to innovative technologies and modernization, inexpensive and well integrated M&A activity, unexpected capital return to shareholders in the form of dividends, market share gains in the mission technology arena, better than expected margin expansion. Cadre Holdings Inc (CDRE)

We value CDRE on a relative EV/EBITDA basis on adjusted 2026 estimates. We assume a 10x multiple, which is .7x relative to the S&P500. As a result, we derive a PO of $26. Upside Risks: Cadre is more acquisitive than we assume and expands margins more rapidly than we anticipate. Increased organic sales outpace our assumption through a combination of market share gains, price pass through, and increased demand for products. Downside Risks: Cadre's M&A strategy is not successful and the integration of acquisitions is more difficult than anticipated. Synergies are not achieved at the targeted rates, competitors gain market share, and the regulatory environment shifts unfavorably. Crane Co. (CR)

We value CR on relative EV/EBITDA multiple on 2026 estimates. We assume a 1.6x relative multiple to the S&P500 on 2026. We believe this fairly reflects the strong performance CR has demonstrated as a stand-alone company, the value unlocked from both operational and portfolio shaping over the last seven years, and the upside of inorganic growth as the company aggressively pursues M&A. Applying this multiple we derive a $225 PO. Downside risks to our PO are another downturn in commercial aviation, due to an exogenous factor or natural business cyclicality, could adversely affect CR's financial results. CR could be materially affected by increased R&D expense if serious complications should arise from new platforms. A decline in US bill circulation could negatively affect Payment. Weakness in chemicals, oil and gas, and power, could materially affect the outlook for Process Flow Technologies. Increasing asbestos claims could result in higher settlement or defense costs and thus affect CR's financial results.

Upside risks to our PO are a faster recovery in its end-markets than expected, particularly in commercial aerospace, acquisitions, which could provide upside to our estimates, better than-expected execution, which could increase the company's earnings power, and share buybacks, which could be greater than anticipated. Garmin (GRMN) We derive our PO of $185 using a 0.9x relative PE multiple applied to 2026E as we think it fairly balances strong wearables demand with potential downside risk to AutoOEM demand and potential supply chain impacts from tariffs. Upside risks to our PO are faster-than-expected growth from new products like smart wearables and the development of an innovative category making product. Increased demand for wearables could provide upside to our estimates.

Downside risks to our PO are market saturation in the medium term, after some of GRMN's end markets experienced strong tailwinds in the quarters driven by the pandemic. Industry-wide constraints of certain electrical components could also provide some downside to our estimates if disruptions intensify and supply chains deteriorate. FX and freight headwinds could also continue to weigh on margins. GE Aerospace (GE) Our PO of $365 is derived using a 1.7x relative P/FCF multiple vs. the S&P500 on 2026 estimates. This implies a 2.2% FCF yield. We see the multiple as fairly capturing the robust demand environment in commercial OE, aftermarket shop-visit growth, strong IP-driven portfolio, and anticipated profitability of the LEAP program starting in 2025. Upside risks to our PO are additionally aftermarket strength, if margins fare better than we are forecasting, if the company executes on existing programs better than expected, or if gains share in the international market or makes a materially accretive acquisition.

Downside risks to our PO are a downturn in commercial aviation due to the natural business cycle or an exogenous event such as a terrorist attack or a pandemic, a severe global economic slowdown affecting top-line growth, execution risk on defense programs or unexpected cancellations to programs, and uncertain timing around orders from international programs. General Dynamics (GD) Our PO of $400 is derived using a 1.1x relative multiple to the S&P 2026e EV/EBITDA. We think a premium to the market fairly considers the strength of the defense portfolio, continued Gulfstream performance, upside opportunities at Marine, and improving Tech operations. Downside risks to our PO are 1) a downturn could occur in business jets, due to an exogenous factor, 2) given that business jets are priced in dollars, an unexpected devaluation in the dollar could significantly impact order activity, 3) poor execution on defense programs could adversely impact margins, 4) defense budget cuts could limit growth in the medium and long term. HEICO Corporation (HEI)

Our PO of $400 is based on a 2.5x relative P/FCF multiple to the S&P 500 on CY26 estimates. Historically, HEI has traded between 0.9x and 2.6x NTM relative P/FCF multiple (excluding outlier period in 2013). In our view, a relative multiple above HEI's 5-year 1.92x average fairly factors in HEI's unique market positioning, strong management execution and a sound balance sheet. Downside risks are a longer-than-expected economic slowdown, which would likely lower original equipment manufacturer (OEM) production rates and demand for air travel, higher oil prices, which would likely derail air traffic growth and, therefore, aircraft demand, less acceptance of PMAs from the airline community, a change in acquisition strategy and integration. Upside risks are increased M&A due to the company's acquisitive history, faster growth in sales, a stronger-than-expected commercial aero recovery, better-than-expected margins, a greater acceptance of parts manufacturer approval (PMA) parts by airlines and lessors.

Hexcel Corporation (HXL) We derive our PO of $60 from a 0.7x P/FCF relative to the S&P 500 on 2026E. We note that a 0.7x multiple is near the lower end of HXL's historical range and below its historical average of 1.2x P/FCF, which we think is justified given continued uncertainty in the commercial aero market extending into 2026. Upside risks to our PO are: if Airbus A350, A320neo, and 737MAX production rates continue to ramp up better expected and 787 deliveries recommence, HXL will continue to benefit as a carbon fiber OE pure play and may trade at a higher premium to the market compared to our estimates. An increase in oil prices could also boost demand for newer, more fuel-efficient commercial jetliners and provide upside to estimates in the medium term.

Downside risks to our PO are: the majority of sales are OEM and there is little aftermarket, which could prove problematic if the civil aircraft cycle turns dramatically due to the uncertain economic environment. HXL could be materially impacted if serious complications should arise from new platforms like the 787 and A350. Unexpected cancellations to programs in both commercial and military could materially impact HXL as a result. Should HXL run into any problems with execution, particularly as capacity is expanding, that would impact results. Howmet Aerospace Inc. (HWM) Our $250 PO is derived using a relative P/FCF multiple on 2.5x on 2026E, resulting in a 70x P/FCF multiple. We think a 2.5x relative multiple fairly reflects the potential upside of the ongoing recovery in OEM production rates along with HWM's strong position to increased spares demand, the growing exposure to AI-driven data center demand through IGT and commercial aeroderivative gas turbines (repurposed old jet engines), and a premium associated with demand on high quality names.

Upside risks to our PO are an accelerated commercial aero upcycle, additional wins from commercial original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) moving away from VSMPO, increased F-35 sales either domestically or internationally, and further pressure on emissions standards, thus benefitting the company's wheels business. Downside risks are the economic backdrop results in another downturn to the commercial aero cycle that is not offset by the unmet demand of the last few years, F-35 program deliveries decline and the trucking industry sees a significant downturn. Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) Our PO of $300 reflects a 16x P/FCF multiple on 2026E. The 16x P/FCF multiple implies a 0.6x relative multiple to the S&P 500 on 2026E. This is below the 10-year average of 0.8x. We think that a relative multiple of 0.6x fairly factors in persistent supply chain, labor, and performance challenges.

Upside risks to our PO are if the US government's "pivot to the Pacific" strategy involves procuring more ships than we forecast and margins continue to expand beyond expected. Higher share repurchases could provide upside to reported EPS. Accretive acquisitions could increase future expected earnings. Downside risks to our PO are cost overruns derail the company's plan to maintain operating margins above 9%, the Navy takes a budget cut and reduces current fleet procurement, and weaker-than-expected synergies from announced acquisitions. Intuitive Machines (LUNR)

Our PO of $9.50 is based on a SOTP valuation that factors in a 3x EV/sales multiple on 2026E on legacy LUNR and a 1.6x EV/sales multiple on 2026E on Lanteris. The 1.6x multiple on Lanteris corresponds to a 1x relative EV/EBITDA multiple vs. the S&P500, which is at the higher end of Maxar's historical range when publicly traded. We think this fairly reflects LUNR's relative positioning on existing programs. Downside risks to our PO are production delays, setbacks to the economic recovery, and execution challenges. Upside risks to our PO are better-than-expected cost cutting and margin expansion, market share gains, higher utilization levels, and better-than-expected commercialization. KBR (KBR)

Our PO of $45 is based on a 0.5x EV/EBITDA multiple to the defense primes on 2026 estimates. This equals 8x EV/EBITDA multiple. We think the lower relative multiple fairly accounts for risks to NASA budget, contract losses, and Lake Charles uncertainty, partially offset by upside from SOTP valuation as the spin deal approaches completion. Downside risks: cuts to the US government budget vs. anticipated, increased competition from non-traditional players, problems integrating M&A, hiring the right personnel, containing costs, executing on fixed price contracts, sustaining reputational risk and earning future awards. On Sustainable Technologies, risks are slower-than-expected adoption of sustainable technologies, or higher-than-expected competition, and thus, lower-than-expected profitability.

Upside risks: better-than-anticipated budget allocated to innovative technologies and modernization, inexpensive and well-integrated M&A activity, unexpected capital return to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks, market share gains, and better-than-expected margin expansion. On Sustainable Technologies, upside risks are faster-than-expected adoption of sustainable technologies, market share gains, higher-than-expected profitability, and unlocking the SOTP valuation as the deal reaches completion. L3Harris (LHX) Our PO of $400 is based on a 27x 2026e P/FCF multiple. This P/FCF multiple reflects a 0.9x relative multiple to the S&P500 on 2026 estimates, slightly above the historical average. We think this relative multiple fairly reflects the defensive nature of the stock in the current environment, and upside from Golden Dome, Space, solid rocket motor exposure.

Upside risk to our PO could result from LHX winning more content on new and existing programs vs. our expectations. Downside risk to our PO could result from continued supply chain challenges and LHX's transformational efforts being delays or unable to meaningfully improve operations across the portfolio. Additionally with future M&A there is a risk integration challenges could put a strain on cash and impact our FCF estimates. Finally, there is the risk that the Missile Solutions transaction is not completed. Leidos Holdings (LDOS) Our PO of $235 is based on 0.9x relative EV/EBITDA multiple to the defense primes on 2026 estimates. We think a multiple slightly below the primes fairly reflects the near-term pricing pressure from transitioning some managed services programs to more commercial-terms and the opportunities at defense systems, healthcare, and border security. This equals a 13.5x EV/EBITDA.

Downside risks to our PO are: cuts to the US Government budget vs. anticipated, increased competition from non-traditional players, problems integrating M&A, hiring the right personnel, containing its costs, estimating costs and executing on fixed price contracts, sustaining reputational risk and future awards. Upside risks to our PO are: a better than anticipated federal budget allocated to innovative technologies and modernization, inexpensive and well integrated M&A activity, unexpected capital return to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks, market share gains, better than expected margin expansion. Leonardo DRS, Inc. (DRS) We derive our PO of $50 based on a 25x EV/EBITDA multiple on 2026e. This implies a 1.7x relative multiple to the defense primes on 2026 estimates. A multiple above the broader market and in line with SMID cap defense peers alludes to the company's high growth profile and exposure to long-term programs with strongly predictable schedules and funding.

Downside risks to our PO are continued supply chain challenges pertaining to microelectronics, lumpiness of Columbia-class revenues, poor execution on fixed-price programs, continued fixed-price contract awards, poor award activity in the international market, potentially diminished funding for land systems in which DRS supports, and volatility from potential parent company secondary offering. Upside risks to our PO are even higher-than-expected growth in defense spending, accelerated margin ramp on the Columbia-class program, more cost-plus contract awards, continued strength in the international market, continued funding for land systems, and the gradual reduction in Leonardo SpA's ownership stake. Northrop Grumman (NOC) We derive our PO of $685 based on 18x 2026e EV/EBITDA vs. the S&P500 of 15x. We see the 1.2x premium to the market as fairly reflecting NOC's strong position on critical legs of the nuclear triad and exposure to growing DoD and international investment spending.

Downside risks to our PO are that execution risk on defense programs could result in cost overruns and margin contractions, and unexpected cancellations to programs in both commercial and military could materially impact NOC. OSI Systems (OSIS) Our PO of $315 is based on a 20x EV/EBITDA multiple on 2026e estimates. This corresponds to a 1.3x relative multiple to the market. We think a 1.3x relative multiple to the market fairly reflects the premium and increased emphasis on border security with upside opportunity from recent acquisitions. Upside risks to our PO are stronger-than-expected customer demand for security and inspection, a higher contribution of security-as-a-service revenues, and customer destocking unwinding leading to increased orders for electronic and optoelectronic components. Strategic M&A provides another potential avenue for upside. Downside risks to our PO are a broader industrial downturn, a significant decline in the Department of Homeland Security or Customs and Border Protection budgets, and a longer-than-expected timeline for the derisking of the Healthcare business.

Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Our PO of $255 is based on a 15x EV/EBITDA on 2035E. We use a longer-term valuation methodology to reflect sustained high-growth and profitability profile of the company. We think this valuation fairly captures the beneficial position to national security and US government/allies' digital modernization efforts, a leading role in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platforms, opportunistic partnerships, strong balance sheet and strong profitability. Downside risks to our PO are lower-than-expected AI-platforms market growth, faster than expected commoditization, higher success from competitors to catch up with technologies, and/or stronger than expected resistance from government customers to use commercial off the shelf solutions. Upside risks to our PO are stronger-than-expected growth of the AI-platforms market, higher-than-expected PLTR penetration, better-than-expected profitability, and/or successful agreements and investments. Parsons Corporation (PSN)

Our PO of $90 is based on a SOTP valuation that factors in a 12x 2026E EV/EBITDA multiple on Federal Solutions and 20x 2026E EV/EBITDA on Critical Infrastructure. We think this fairly reflects the strength in PSN's end markets and upcoming opportunities across both segments. Downside risks: cuts to the US Government budget vs. anticipated, slow award environment, increased competition from non-traditional players, problems integrating M&A, hiring the right personnel, containing costs, executing on fixed price contracts, sustaining reputational risk and earning future awards. At Critical Infrastructure: delays in infrastructure build and funding, softness in the Middle East, or higher than expected competition, and thus lower than expected profitability.

Upside risks: better than anticipated budget allocated to innovative technologies and modernization, return of the DOS confidential contract, a pick up in awards, inexpensive and well-integrated M&A activity, unexpected capital return to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks, market share gains, and better than expected margin expansion. On Critical Infrastructure upside risks include faster than expected infrastructure spending, market share gains, and higher than expected profitability. RBC Bearings Inc (RBC) We derive our PO of $500 using 1.7x relative EV/EBITDA multiple on CY2026 estimates. Over the last five years, RBC has traded on average 1.5x the one-year-forward EV/EBITDA multiple. We believe that the 1.7x multiple fairly reflects growth in aerospace, defense, and the industrial aftermarket while considering macro environment uncertainties

Downside risks to our price objective are as follows: 1) Acquisitions are a core part of the company's growth strategy. This is an inherently risky strategy that relies on the availability of attractive acquisition candidates and successful integration. 2) RBC operates in a highly competitive global bearing industry. Some of the company's key competitors are significantly larger or divisions of larger companies. 3) Lower-than-expected build rates at its key aerospace and defense customer Boeing could provide downside to our estimates. 4) US government uncertainty could defer military maintenance and procurement programs. Upside risks to our price objective are: 1) growth from acquisitions, 2) better-than-expected commercial aerospace growth, 3) improvement in the Industrial end markets, 4) stronger-than-expected execution that would increase gross margins. Redwire Corp (RDW)

Our PO of $6 is derived from a 0.2x EV/sales/growth multiple on 2026E, which implies a 3.0x EV/sales multiple on 2026E. The 0.2x EV/sales/growth multiple is at the lower end of SMID Cap defense tech and space peers. We see the multiple as fairly reflecting Redwire's exposure to growing end markets in defense and space, though we see volatility and lack of visibility as making Redwire less attractive than some of its peers. Upside risks to our PO are accelerated global defense and/or space spending, faster- and better-than-expected margin expansion, inexpensive and well-integrated M&A activity, and market share gains. Downside risks to our PO are pressure on defense and/or space investment and procurement funding, increased competition from non-traditional defense providers, risky M&A, and risk associated with concentrated ownership of RDW's equity. Rocket Lab (RKLB)

Our PO of $120 is based on a long-term DCF of base, bull, and bear cases for different revenue and cash generation scenarios between now and 2045. We are extending our DCF to 2045 to account for evolving growth opportunities in space applications, which we see as meaningful given RKLB's progression as an end-to-end space prime and increased recent attention to large-scale space infrastructure. Our DCF factors in a 12% discount rate and assigns 33% probability to the base case, 33% probability to the bull case, and a 33% probability to the bear case. Our discount rate employs a lower beta than the historical average to account for the company's maturing launch capabilities and space services offerings, as well as reduced volatility from RKLB's inclusion in the Russell 1000 index. In our view, the equal weighting fairly reflects current investor risk appetite, momentum for new technology space stocks, and the perceived viability of Rocket Lab's business model compared to peers.

Downside risks to our PO are production delays, constellation launch market remaining captive to certain providers, setbacks to the economic recovery, inability to achieve M&A synergies, and setbacks to Neutron vehicle development. Upside risks to our PO are better-than-expected cost cutting and margin expansion, well integrated M&A activity, market share gains in satellite components and services, higher reutilization levels, and better-than-expected commercialization of the Neutron launch vehicle. RTX Corp (RTX) Our PO of $215 is based on 2026E EV/EBITDA 21x multiple vs. the S&P500 of 15x. We think the 21x fairly reflects the pressures and opportunity for upside at current levels. We think a multiple slightly above the market fairly reflects RTX turning the corner of the recent GTF issue, strong demand tail winds, and defense exposure entering a period of reignited growth.

Upside risks to our PO are if the GTF issues are fixed faster and smoother than anticipated, if the commercial aero and bizjet recoveries are better than expected, if margins fare better than we are forecasting, if the company executes on existing programs better than expected, or if gains share in the international market or makes a materially accretive acquisition. Downside risks to our PO are a downturn in commercial aviation due to the natural business cycle or an exogenous event such as a terrorist attack or a pandemic, additional complications related to the GTF powder-metal issue present further risks, a severe global economic slowdown affecting top-line growth as 45% of sales are generated outside the US, execution risk on defense programs or unexpected cancellations to programs, and uncertain timing around orders from international programs. Teledyne Technologies Inc (TDY)

We value TDY based on a 1.2x EV/EBITDA multiple relative to the S&P500. A 1.2x relative multiple is in-line with the historical average. We see a multiple in-line with the historical average as fairly balancing the near-term headwinds, the recovery in the short-cycle business and strong demand in Defense and Aerospace. Applying this to our 2026 estimates, we derive a $640 PO. Upside risks to our PO are higher accretion from acquisitions, a more rapid top- and bottom-line recovery in the industrials businesses and even further operating leverage. Downside risks are poor integration of acquisitions, another industrials downturn, a significant decline in the Department of Defense (DOD) budget, an exogenous event that prevents international sales. TransDigm Group Inc. (TDG)

Our PO of $1,615 is based on a 1.5x EV/EBITDA relative multiple to the S&P 500 on CY26E. The 1.5x multiple is in line with the average relative multiple. In our view, this multiple reflects TDG's strong aftermarket positioning, robust margin performance, and solid cash generation. Downside risks to our PO are: Higher oil prices would likely derail air traffic growth and, therefore, aircraft demand, resulting in a downturn in commercial aviation. A downturn in commercial aviation, due to exogenous factors, such as a terrorist attack or natural business cyclicality, could adversely impact TDG's financial results. If the defense budget for RDT&E and investment accounts do not increase as we expect, this could affect TDG's defense business. However, if the commercial aerospace and business aviation jet recoveries are better than we are forecasting, earnings could fare better than our projections and the stock could perform better. If margins fare better than we are forecasting, there could also be upside potential to our valuation. Voyager Technologies (VOYG)

Our price objective of $41 is based on a 9x EV/sales multiple on 2026E. A valuation higher than defense tech peers fairly reflects the company's differentiated offerings, exposure to critical and well supported national security and space programs, and upside opportunities presented by Starlab. Upside risks to our PO are accelerated Golden Dome spend, faster- and better-than expected margin expansion, inexpensive and well-integrated M&A activity, and market share gains. Downside risks to our PO are pressure on US Government budget, delays in Starlab launch and profitability, increased competition from non-traditional providers, risky M&A, and corporate governance risk associated with VOYG's controlled company status.

Valuation Trends First-of-its-kind UDG deal with a major defense player Last week, L3Harris (LHX) announced a partnership with DoW aimed at spurring critical solid rocket motor production. LHX will spin off its Missile Solutions business and DoW will invest $1bn in convertible preferred equity in the new business. LHX will retain a majority stake in Missile Solutions, planned to IPO in 2H26. See our report entitled LHX to spin Missile Solutions with $1bn investment from DoW; raise PO to $400 . This is a first-of-its-kind deal that will give the US Government a significant stake in a large defense prime, but notably LHX highlighted the deal is purely financial and the USG will not have a board seat or other governance control. Government interest in taking shares of defense primes has been in focus since last August following Commerce Secretary Lutnick ' s remarks, and investors continue to ask, " what does this mean for the future of the defense industry? " See our August report . LHX stock reaction more muted, questions remain

The deal with LHX represents the latest US government investment in corporate America (including a 10% stake in Intel and investments in critical mineral producers). Intel shares have more than doubled since the announcement, but investors seem to be approaching the LHX investment with more caution. For one, it could represent a meaningful conflict of interest - can the Pentagon have an ownership stake in a company of which it is also its largest customer? How will this impact large contract awards and competition among the primes? LHX, LMT are 2 examples of changing gov't strategy The structure of the LHX deal is markedly different than the contract signed in early January by Lockheed Martin (LMT) to more than triple PAC-3 Missile production over 7 years. However, both deals come as the DoW seeks to overhaul its acquisition strategy and ensure steady demand signals to spur continued investment. This is in line with the DoW ' s Direct-to-Supplier initiative, which pushes for more direct negotiation and investment in suppliers of key products including motors, munitions, and other critical components.

Taking the European approach We note that direct government ownership is not a new idea in the global defense industrial base. The French government owns 11.5% of SAFRAN while Airbus is owned 11% by both France and Germany and 4% by Spain. These could serve as examples of the successes of government ownership. Industry experts and the investor community have all speculated on what this first step of US government ownership may mean for other primes.
