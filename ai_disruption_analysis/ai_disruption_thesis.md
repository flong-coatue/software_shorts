# AI Disruption Thesis

## Executive Summary

Every stock exposed to AI disruption falls into one of three buckets. This framework is the primary tool for portfolio construction:


| Bucket                | What It Means                       | Action          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **1: AI Winner**      | AI improves the business            | **Long**        |
| **2: Narrative Risk** | Unclear AI impact, market skeptical | **Don't Touch** |
| **3: AI Loser**       | Clear disruption mechanism          | **Short**       |

**The key insight on Bucket 2:** These companies might be fundamentally fine, but they're uninvestable. You cannot win the narrative battle with near-term performance because the market is pricing 2028+ scenarios today. Per Thomas: *"If you can't tell if AI helps or hurts them, just stay away."*

## Part 1: The Three-Bucket Framework

### Why This Framework

High-multiple stocks are re-rating based on **terminal value concerns, not near-term fundamentals**. This means:

1. Companies cannot "blow out numbers" to fight multiple compression
2. The narrative about AI disruption matters more than current performance
3. Your job is to distinguish valid disruption narratives from invalid ones

### Bucket Definitions


| Bucket                | Definition                                                                                      | Action          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **1: AI Winner**      | AI directly improves core product, creates new revenue, strengthens moat                        | **Long**        |
| **2: Narrative Risk** | Market thinks AI loser, but fundamentals unclear. Sentiment risk without clear fundamental risk | **Don't Touch** |
| **3: AI Loser**       | Clear AI disruption thesis with identifiable mechanisms and timelines                           | **Short**       |

### Critical Insight on Bucket 2

These companies might be fundamentally fine but are **uninvestable** because you cannot win the narrative battle with near-term performance. The market is pricing 2028+ scenarios today.

Thomas's framing: *"If you can't clearly articulate why AI helps or hurts the business, just stay away. You're not going to outthink the market on unclear situations—and you don't need to. Focus your capital on Buckets 1 and 3 where you have conviction."*

## Part 2: Software Deep Dive (P×Q Framework)

### Core Logic

**Revenue = Price × Quantity**

The key question: *Is Q bottlenecked on human labor?*


| Model                                                                               | AI Impact  | Why                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Seat-based** (CRM, HCM, collaboration)                                            | **Loser**  | Fewer employees = fewer seats. AI agents replace workers → revenue shrinks |
| **Usage-based with human-bottlenecked Q** (data infrastructure, API-based services) | **Winner** | AI removes bottleneck → Q explodes → revenue explodes                     |

### The Transition Problem

Companies can't charge both seat-based AND usage-based. Customers won't pay double. Pivoting pricing models is extremely difficult.

### Generic Example

Consider a data infrastructure company with consumption-based pricing. Today, Q is bottlenecked by a limited pool of technical users who can write queries. Tomorrow, AI copilots let a much larger population of business users query directly. **Q increases dramatically** while P (price per compute unit) stays constant.

### Coatue's Internal View

From our Jan 12 investment meeting: **Working toward 300-500bps short exposure in certain SaaS names**. Key concern: "Most software growth dollars flowing to AI startups and model companies rather than incumbent SaaS."

Recent expert call findings:

- Zero AI upsell traction from collaboration/productivity vendors
- Large platform players winning the coding agent wallet
- Developer headcount growth moved from MSD-HSD to **flat or declining**
- Customer mandate: "We're doing everything we can not to expand spend with any SaaS vendor right now"

## Part 3: Internet-Specific Considerations

### Terminal Value Framing

Internet stocks with high multiples are particularly exposed because so much of their value comes from terminal value assumptions. When the market reprices terminal value based on AI disruption fears, current fundamentals become nearly irrelevant.

### Green Flags (Valid Bear Narrative → Bucket 3)

- Measurable substitution (users actively switching to AI alternative)
- Revenue impact (early evidence of traffic/revenue displacement)
- Structural disadvantage (company cannot match AI competitor's economics)
- Management acknowledgment (company addressing threat in filings/calls)

### Red Flags (Invalid Bear Narrative → Bucket 2)

- No specific mechanism ("AI is bad for X" without explaining how)
- Indefinite timeline (disruption always 5+ years away)
- Ignores adaptation (assumes company won't integrate AI)
- Sentiment echo chamber (narrative driven by social media, not fundamentals)

---

## Part 4: AI Loser Categories (Bucket 3 Deep Dive)

The following categories represent clear AI disruption mechanisms with identifiable timelines. From the Feb 3 AI Disruption meeting: *"No floor to the multiples... need to avoid getting shaken out on some 10% squeeze—must understand direction of travel clearly."*

### Category 1: Online Travel Agencies (BKNG, EXPE, ABNB)

**Priority Level:** Highest conviction short. Target 3-5% combined exposure.

**Current Economics:**
- OTAs take ~13% take rate on bookings, generating ~$9B in EBITDA
- 75%+ of Booking's traffic is direct (better unit economics)
- Google historically captured $15B in ad revenue from same bookings

**AI Disruption Mechanism:**
- Take rates compress from 13% → 3-6% as discovery moves to LLMs
- ChatGPT/Gemini handle travel booking directly—easier than building ad business
- Inventory moat weakening: AI accelerates hotel onboarding, even small properties
- 15% of Booking's room nights come from major chains that could integrate directly with AI platforms
- Sponsored listing revenue (~10% of revenue) disappears as searches move to LLMs

**Outcome Scenarios:**
- Best case: OTAs become "pipes" at 3-7% take rates
- Worst case: Business goes to zero

**Valuation:** BKNG trading at 18x earnings—expensive given risk. Team views this as "obvious" short with high confidence economics will be worse in 5 years (possibly 1 year at current pace).

---

### Category 2: Discovery & Social Platforms (PINS, RDDT, ROKU)

**Core Thesis:** Discovery is moving to LLMs. AI agents with access to Gmail, purchase history, and texts already know user preferences—don't need these platforms for recommendations.

**Pinterest (PINS):**
- Trades at 27x GAAP '26 earnings, 21x GAAP '27
- Viewed as "zero" as discovery moves to LLMs
- Highest ARPDAU per minute in industry, but no user growth
- Worst engagement (~15 min/day vs. 2 hours for TikTok/Meta)
- Not a true performance ad platform
- *"Was dead before AI—AI just accelerates decline"*

**Reddit (RDDT):**
- Users not growing
- 60-70% ad revenue growth was backloaded catch-up, mostly brand ads (not performance)
- Licensing deals may happen once but aren't sustainable
- High multiple based on current growth that won't sustain
- New ad supply from OpenAI creates headwinds

**Roku (ROKU):**
- Platforms become less valuable as agents handle purchasing through ChatGPT/Gemini
- Trading at expensive multiple for "crappy business"
- *"If Netflix is in the tank, Roku can't do amazing"*

---

### Category 3: E-Commerce Infrastructure (SHOP)

**Current Moat:** Best platform to build e-commerce websites, only charges 2% of GMV.

**AI Disruption Mechanism:**
- If interface shifts from eyeballs to agents, merchants just need API hooks—why build websites?
- Anthropic or other AI companies could create "e-commerce ghost kitchens"—just API endpoints for agent purchases
- One-click checkout advantage becomes irrelevant if agents handle everything
- OpenAI has "Agent Commerce Protocol" (ACP)—standardized API for processing payments

**Key Tracking Metric:** ACP adoption as bearish indicator.

**Broader Principle:** Any e-commerce company that doesn't do "dirty operations and logistics" is at risk. (Note: This may actually make ETSY more at risk than SHOP given SHOP's fulfillment investments.)

**Valuation:** Trades at infinite P/E, 40x non-GAAP.

---

### Category 4: Information Services (IT, FDS, TRI)

**Core Debate:** What data is proprietary vs. commoditized, and which businesses are defensible? Many companies mix data with UI—question is whether AI disintermediates the UI layer.

**Most At-Risk (Commoditized Data + UI Layer):**

| Company | Risk Level | Reason |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Thomson Reuters (TRI) | High | Market data readily accessible elsewhere |
| FactSet (FDS) | High | Market-oriented platform; data available from exchanges |
| Gartner (IT) | High | Survey shows 32% cutting seats "to replace with AI" |

**Gartner Deep Dive (Customer Survey, N=50):**
- Average customer has 11 seats at $26K/seat
- Wallet retention implied at 97%—lowest in company history
- Most common reason for cutting: "to replace Gartner research with AI"
- 96% of respondents already using tools like Deep Research
- Customer quote: *"Decreasing to the point where it has little to no value"*

**More Defensible (But Still Expensive):**
- S&P (SPGI): Ratings business is duopoly, legally required, mission-critical
- Verisk (VRSK): Insurance data pooled into nonprofit, viewed as impenetrable moat
- CoStar (CSGP): Bloomberg for real estate

**Internal Insight:** Team uses Claude/AI tools internally and built caching engine—FactSet query growth is "comfortable." Claude Code can find "pretty frickin' good" alternatives to FactSet data.

---

### Category 5: IT Services (ACM, INFY, TCS, CTSH, EPAM)

**Core Thesis:** Billable hours model breaks when AI increases efficiency. Contracts are cost-plus where cost = billable hours. More AI efficiency = fewer billable hours = lower revenue per project.

**From India IT Services Trip (Aug 2025):**
- Companies openly talking about decoupling revenue growth from headcount growth
- Every firm affirming need to transform from time-and-materials (60-70% of revenue) to fixed-price/outcome-based
- This will be **massively deflationary**—race to the bottom on price

**GCC Acceleration (Global Capability Centers):**
- Real estate checks show massive acceleration—one firm leased office space for 500K employees (entire size of TCS) in last 12 months
- Enterprises in-sourcing BPO to save the 30-35% gross margin IT services firms capture

**ACM Specific:**
- $14B MC, $115M ADV
- "Existential AI loser"—management claims AI investments have operating leverage, but ignores market pricing impact
- Only saved by outsized share gains or vastly outpacing market growth

**Customer Quotes:**
- *"The weak macro means we're having to bake bigger AI-productivity discounts into bids just to hold share"* — LTIM
- *"Peers are suddenly extremely aggressive on pricing; the macro shock is pushing them to concede upfront, betting AI efficiencies will pay back later"* — TCS

### Key Principle for AI Loser Shorts

*"Industry executives over 40 will say 'it's not a problem'—seen this pattern before. Need to talk to disruptors (OpenAI, Anthropic integrators) not incumbents."*

**Position Management Sequence:**
1. Exit long positions in information services companies first
2. Then evaluate which should be shorts
