category,priority,example_tickers,underlying_data,core_function,interface_replaceability,realistic_barriers
Accounting / Finance,High,INTU,"General ledger, accounts payable/receivable, invoices, bank transactions, tax records","Record transactions, generate financial statements, ensure compliance, manage cash flow","Medium - bookkeeping and data entry highly automatable; audit/compliance requires human judgment","Tax code complexity, audit requirements, bank integrations, trust (handling money), regulatory oversight (CPA requirements)"
CRM,High,"CRM, HUBS","Customer contact info, interaction history, deal pipeline, communication logs, account hierarchies","Track customer relationships, manage sales pipeline, forecast revenue, coordinate team selling","Medium - data is portable but workflows span many users and integrations; AI could replace individual rep tasks but not the system of record","Deep integrations (email, calendar, phone, marketing), multi-user coordination, audit trails for compliance, ecosystem of 3rd party apps, training/adoption investment"
Data / Analytics,High,"SNOW, DDOG, MDB","Raw data, queries, dashboards, metrics, logs, application traces","Store/query data at scale, monitor applications, visualize metrics, enable data science","Low-Medium - data infrastructure is foundation; AI needs this data to function; analytics layer more vulnerable than storage","Data gravity (moving large data is hard), performance requirements, security/compliance, vendor lock-in from proprietary formats"
Design Tools,High,"ADBE, FGMR","Design files, templates, brand assets, collaboration history, design systems","Create visual content, enable design collaboration, maintain brand consistency","High - AI image/design generation advancing rapidly; production design workflows still need human creativity","Creative workflow complexity, team collaboration features, brand asset management, but generative AI is direct threat"
DevOps / CI-CD,High,GTLB,"Source code, build artifacts, deployment pipelines, test results, infrastructure configs","Automate software build/test/deploy, manage code versions, enable collaboration","Medium - AI coding assistants augment but developers still need CI/CD infrastructure; ops automation increasing","Developer tool preferences, pipeline complexity, security/compliance requirements, integration with cloud providers"
E-commerce Platforms,High,SHOP,"Product catalogs, orders, inventory, customer data, storefront configurations","Enable online selling, manage orders/inventory, process payments, customize storefronts","Medium-High - SHOP trades at ~40x non-GAAP. AI disruption risk: if interface shifts from eyeballs to agents, merchants just need API hooks - why build websites? OpenAI has Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) for agent purchases. Counter: SHOP integrating AI throughout product (Sidekick/Magic) to supercharge merchants; dirty ops/logistics provide moat","Payment processing relationships, fulfillment integrations, app ecosystem, merchant switching costs. Any e-commerce company that doesn't do dirty operations and logistics is at risk. Track ACP adoption as bearish indicator"
Information Services / Data Providers,High,"TRI, FDS, SPGI","Proprietary datasets, market data, research, ratings, legal/regulatory databases","Provide authoritative data, enable analysis, support compliance, reduce information asymmetry","Bifurcated: TRI/FDS HIGH RISK - market data is commoditized, essentially UI layers that AI disintermediates. Claude Code can find alternatives to FDS data. SPGI LOW RISK - Ratings business is duopoly, legally required, mission-critical; only ~5% of rev from CapIQ. SPGI has proprietary data moat + AI drives margin expansion (MI segment has ~5k+ employees doing manual data collection that can be automated 30%+)","TRI/FDS: low barriers, data available elsewhere, AI native entrants emerging. SPGI: regulatory designation (ratings), authoritative/trusted sources, compliance requirements. Verisk has insurance data pooled into nonprofit - impenetrable moat"
Project Management,High,"MNDY, TEAM","Tasks, timelines, dependencies, team assignments, project status, comments/discussions","Coordinate work across teams, track progress, manage resources, enable collaboration","Medium-High - task management UI is low moat; MNDY cited SEO algorithm changes hurting top-of-funnel. Seat growth and per-seat pricing stalling as AI agents commoditize UI layer. NOW trades ~14x rev / 100x GAAP EPS; TEAM ~40x fwd EPS - structural rerating to 12-15x GAAP EPS likely","Network effects (team already using it), integration ecosystem, template/workflow libraries, but low data lock-in. High SBC will look unmanageable as multiples compress"
Real Estate Tech,High,"CSGP, ZG","Property listings, transaction data, valuations, tenant/landlord data, market analytics","List properties, enable transactions, manage properties, provide market data","Medium - search and matching are AI-ready; but transactions require human agents (regulations), property management is operational. CSGP viewed as Bloomberg for real estate - way too expensive given AI risk","Real estate regulations, MLS access requirements, transaction complexity, local market expertise needs"
Document Management / E-signature,Medium,DOCU,"Contracts, signatures, document workflows, audit trails, templates","Enable legally binding e-signatures, manage document workflows, maintain compliance","Medium - signature capture is commodity; value is in legal validity, integrations, and workflow automation","Legal/regulatory acceptance, security certifications, integration with CRM/CLM, audit trail requirements, trust"
ERP,Low,"SAP, ORCL","Financial transactions, inventory, supply chain data, manufacturing data, cross-functional business processes","Integrate core business processes, maintain single source of truth for financials, manage supply chain","Low - ERP is the operational backbone; AI augments but doesn't replace the transactional core","Mission-critical (downtime = revenue loss), regulatory requirements (SOX, GAAP), multi-year implementations, organizational process alignment"
HCM / HR Software,Low,"WDAY, PAYC, PCTY","Employee records, payroll data, benefits enrollment, time/attendance, performance reviews, compliance docs","Manage employee lifecycle, run payroll, administer benefits, ensure labor compliance","Low - heavily regulated, requires system of record for legal/tax purposes; AI helps at edges (recruiting, Q&A)","Payroll tax compliance (state-by-state), benefits administration complexity, audit requirements, data sensitivity, integration with banking/tax systems"
Healthcare IT,Low,"VEEV, HIMS","Patient records, clinical data, billing codes, regulatory documentation, drug data","Manage patient care, ensure compliance (HIPAA), handle billing, support clinical decisions","Low - heavily regulated (HIPAA, FDA), patient safety critical, audit requirements; AI augments but doesn't replace","HIPAA compliance, FDA regulations (for clinical), EHR integration complexity, patient safety concerns, liability"
Low-Code / App Development,Low,PTC,"Application logic, data models, workflows, user interfaces, integrations","Enable non-developers to build applications, automate workflows, create internal tools","High - AI can generate code and UIs; low-code value prop (democratize development) overlaps with AI coding assistants","Existing app portfolio, governance/security requirements, integration complexity, but threat from AI coding tools is real"
Payments / Fintech,Low,"PYPL, SQ, ADYEN","Transaction data, merchant data, fraud signals, banking connections, payment credentials","Process payments, prevent fraud, enable commerce, manage money movement","Low - payments are infrastructure; heavily regulated; trust and reliability paramount","Regulatory requirements (money transmission licenses), network effects (merchant/consumer adoption), fraud liability, banking relationships"
Security,Low,"CRWD, PANW, ZS, FTNT","Security logs, threat intelligence, endpoint data, network traffic, vulnerability data","Detect and respond to threats, protect endpoints/networks, ensure compliance","Low - security is mission-critical and rapidly evolving; AI augments SOC but humans needed for judgment calls","Regulatory requirements, risk of breach (existential for companies), need for 24/7 response, trust/reputation of vendor"
Video Conferencing,Low,ZM,"Meeting recordings, transcripts, calendar integrations, virtual background preferences","Enable remote meetings, record/transcribe calls, integrate with calendar/productivity tools","High - video infrastructure is commodity; AI features (summaries, action items) are table stakes. ZM used as case study for SBC-versus-P/E compression","Network effects (external meeting participants), integration with calendar/CRM, security/compliance (encryption), but low switching costs"
