i'm putting together a notion basically outlining all the key internet debates along with every person we need to speak to. idea is break each debate into companies "disrupted", "disruptors" - labs or other big companies, "AI native startups - the new guys ex. labs", and then VCs backing these people. I think the way to get software short in the book is (1) keep demoing things like lunch yesterday, but (2) getting a couple early data points from the most tech forward companies where people are like "yeah we are looking at replacing xx yy" and then you show it to Philippe and be like this is the leading indicator.

I can help with #2. Who in your mind are the key leading tech cos - either private or public. I am getting coffee tomorrow am with Head of Applied AI at Ramp. That for instance could be one - like if ramps doing xx yy that will go a long way in convo with Philippe. Who else would fall into this bucket? I'm basically going to tap my friends and help you guys get to these people but need your thoughts on who would be the key companies and people to speak to. Another one in my universe is DASH. As far as internet goes they are the most tech forward and really ramping AI usage internally + starting to evaluate these things.

let me add i have like 15 convos next week in SF a bunch of VCs, OAI /Anthrop people and some startups

[8:02 AM]
Ramp would be big. They're building a lot of their own software right now

**mbarton** [8:03 AM]
but also add your dream list of like if we can speak to xx guy at yy place

[8:03 AM]
i can get to anyone

**gtsai** [8:04 AM]
SHOP? is there anyway we can get to some internal person there

[8:04 AM]
let me come up with a list

[8:04 AM]
another angle is literally to speak to every Anthropic person who has authored a plugin

**flong** [8:06 AM]
*replied to a thread:*
this type of thing is a very good claude code use case

and we should iterate on it once the coatue infra is setup

Me and my claudes will give this a think

**mbarton** [~8:07 AM]
yes just create a whole list - SHOP definitely good one, but lets also think about the best private companies too. Stripe? Chime? etc

[8:09 AM]
agree plugin angle is good too

**gtsai** [8:12 AM]
Stripe would be huge yes

[8:13 AM]
dont you worry im asking claude for a list
